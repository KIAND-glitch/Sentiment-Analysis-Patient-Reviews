0,38066,1.0,"Dr. Jani is the best!!!!!!!!!! He took his time with me and answered all of my questions. he restored my eye sight from hand motion only to 20/30. Thanks Dr. J and you have the friendliest and most helpful staff. they really go out of their way to make sure you have everything we need and we never leave the office with questions. love you, Kellie and Nicki!!! "
1,38066,1.0,. Great surgeon and Great Bedside manner ! 
2,38067,1.0,"Dr. Jain is a prodigy.I was seeing 20/15 THE NEXT DAY OF MY SURGERY, from 20/800.He's incredible.  "
3,38067,1.0,Dr Jain is an outstanding doctor.His knowledge and manners are very good.He takes the time to explain everything to the patient.He called me after my surgery to make sure i was doing ok.In this day and age it is rare to find a doctor who takes such good care of his patients.Keep up the good work.  
4,38067,1.0,Very Efficient! Great Service ! Finally a doctor who knows what he is doing. 
5,38067,1.0,I find Dr. Jain to be very impressive. He took time to answer all of my questions before my cataract surgery. He is patient and professional.  Over the 3 years I've been seeing Dr Jain for both cataracts and glacoma I have never found a reason to complain about him or his staff.   I should add that I came to Dr Jain after repeated complaints to both my old eye doctor and my primary care doctor over my eyes. Only Dr. Jain realized that I had early stages of glacoma in both eyes. 
6,38067,1.0,"I am extremely surprised at the comments I see here. I had checked the reviews before going to him and after coming back from the surgery, I am so impressed that I couldn't resist writing this. He is unbelievably sure of what he is doing and walked me through each and every step that he was going to take prior to the surgery. He has already called twice to see how I am doing with my eyes. My wife needs to get a lasik done now and I will highly recommend Dr. Jain. Definitely the best in hampton roads.  "
7,38067,1.0,"Dr. Jain barely introduced himself. He was aloof and inexpressive. He barely acknowledged me. He spoke jargon to the tech the entire time. He gave me the diagnosis and continued to talk about it as though I was a person familiar with the condition. I told him I was scared, but he didn't even acknowledge this. I asked him I should be worried or concerned, once again he did not acknowledge this. He was extremely vague and substandard. He did ask me if I had any questions, but I wasn't sure what to ask. I asked him if there is anything else I should know or anything I should be asking, but once again did not acknowledge my questions. He gave me a two-page print out about the condition. I choose unknowledgeable as the level of knowledge because the brief explanation he provided about the condition was almost word for word from the two-page printout he gave me. I left the office feeling disillusioned & extremely unsatisfied with the horrendously, poor level of treatment by Dr. Jain.  "
8,38067,1.0,"Never explains anything, very negligent and did perform right calculations for my lasik surgery and had to another procedure to correct it and billed me again, though their contract clearly says that for upto 6 months anything related o lasik surgery should be done at no additional cost. Made me sign a consent form in dark where I could not read it and lied me that there will not be any additional expense and later sent me the bill. The most unethical and fraudulent doctor and practice I have ever come across. "
9,38068,1.0,"Dr. Jafri himself seems to have a lot of knowledge on gastroenterology.  The main issue I have is seeing him.  My past 4 appointments in a row have had to either be rescheduled or switched to a physicians assistant because Dr. Jafri has had an &quot;emergency&quot; every time.  I haven't been able to actually see him in over 6 months and every time I do see him he has no clue who I am or what is wrong with me until I remind him.  He has been my doctor for over a year now so that's pretty sad.  He's either overbooked with patients or he just doesn't really care about them, I don't know which.  My advice is to find another doctor which is what I am doing because I'm fed up with felling like the doctor that I have spent so much time and money on doesn't even know who I am, let alone care.  MOVING ON "
10,38068,1.0,I've been seeing Dr. Jafri for about 3 years now and I have never had any problems.  I do usually wait a while to see him and occasionally he does seem a little bit rushed in the office.  He has an excellent nurse practitioner and I've seen him for two out-patient surgeries.  Both times went very well and he always took the time to answer any questions that I or my husband had.  He explained my condition in a very straightforward manner and always has suggestions for things that I can do to help alleviate my symptoms.  
11,38069,0.0,"This is an excellent doctor. He has helped my child through 2 cases of pneumonia and was very attentive and concerned. He even takes the time to talk with my 4 year old when he comes in the exam room, read her a short story, and generally make her feel comfortable. I highly recommend this physician.  "
12,38070,1.0,"Dr. Jenkins has been my doctor since his second year of practice, I believe 1979.  He has always taken everything I have said seriously and even though many times I was upset and anxious he would calm me down.  I have been to other doctors for other issues, that didn't get resolved, when having my appointment with him I mention it, he is able to resolve my issue.  He recently referred me to Dr. Roberson for surgery, who I think is excellent as well.  Dr. Jenkins is a great OB/GYN and Williamsburg is lucky to have such a great doctor and practice.  "
13,38070,1.0,Dr. Jenkins has been my gyn for more than 30 years.  He delivered both of my sons.  Dr. Jenkins is a great doctor.  I have recommended him to friends and family.  
14,38070,1.0,"Dr. Jenkins delivered my second son in 2007, another doctor from the practice delivered my daughter in 2008. Though all the doctors in the practice have been wonderful to me over the past couple years, Dr. Jenkins is my favorite. He is not only a very personable man, but always seems to make things seem ok, even when they are not. My very first interaction with him was while I was delivering my son, which he literally walked in and caught my son. If I had not been in so much pain, I would have been laughing... but under the circumstances, that was not possible.  He was very intent on listening to me and my concerns, and after 2 years of follow up visits and complications he has always been very professional, as well as very kind, understanding, and funny! "
15,38070,1.0,"Dr. Jenkins is BY FAR THE BEST OB/GYN ever!  He delivered both of our babies!!!  I had two wonderful experiences with him!!!  I would HIGHLY rec.  him to anyone!!!  He will ALWAYS hold a special place in my heart for delivering our two, healthy children!!!! "
16,38070,1.0,"I love Jenkins. First he's funny and makes light of situations that need to be lightened and also he is very comforting when youre concerned with things. He delivered my sis-in-law and her baby...roberson delivered my baby, which she is great too! They really are wonderful there...although when my water broke, the drs inform you to call the office and I did and someone told me that the on call dr would call me back in 20 minutes...no one EVER called! Luckily we rushed to the hospital. Also, I was 40 weeks and 4 days prego when I had gone to see Jenkins, he told me that there was &quot;no way this baby was coming on her own bc I was only effaced 80% and not dilated at all and I wiould be induced in 2 days. &quot; (that was at 4pm) At 9:30pm that same day, Riley decided she was coming out! She was born 9/21/08 at 11:22am: 6lbs 10 oz! Only God knows :) "
17,38070,1.0,"Dr. Jenkins is very good.  He delivered my 2nd baby... and without any tearing or episiotomy!  Very impressive considering I had 2 stitches w/ my first!  My only complaint is that he didn't really listen to my concerns during the delivery.  I felt like he just wanted to hurry up to give me the epidural and break my water so he could make it back home to watch the big game that night.  Overall, I would still say he's a good doctor.  I also like the other doctors in his practice as well... if not more so than Dr. Jenkins.  "
18,38070,1.0,"As busy as the practice is, with Dr. Jenkins, you're never just another number.  This compassionate, professional treatment is harder and harder to find in today's times. "
19,38071,1.0,"I needed a few crowns. Since I was impressed with other services at Natural Horizons, and was there often, I decided to give Johnson a try. My mistake. Not only did I wind up with irreversible pulpitis, when I called his office the Friday after the initial appointment and 3 days of unrelenting excruciating pain, his staff recommended I come in &quot;next Wednesday&quot;. Well, Monday I hightailed it back to my own excellent dentist nearby who performed the required complex root canal, molded &amp; implanted the crowns on location all that same day. Should have stuck with him in the first place. "
20,38071,1.0,"Dr. Johnson is the only area dentist who was able to recognize the severe, chronic infection my root canalled teeth were causing me by examining panoramic x-rays. I suffered with debilitating sinus issues for decades as a result of other dentists' reluctance to question the viability of root canals over time. Dr. Johnson uses the most up-to-date least toxic materials and methods in providing patient dental care. He treats the patient not just the teeth. He and his assistant &quot;Max&quot; take the time to answer all questions in depth. This is the best dental experience you will ever have. As someone with lifelong teeth problems who has spent more on dental care than many spend on college tuition, I know what I'm talking about. If you have chronic health issues that may be related to teeth issues, he'll be able to tell you. Prices are comparable to what better dentists charge those without insurance. "
21,38071,1.0,Had to go elsewhere for root canal due to irreversible pulpitis. 
22,38071,1.0,"Dr. Johnson is a biological dentist, but his main concern seems to be getting as much money out of his patients as he can.  My experience at his Natural Horizons Wellness Center was horrible.  I went in for removal of my mercury fillings, but he quickly diagnosed me with lyme disease (which I did not and do not have).  His sales technique is to play on people's fears and convince them to visit every other pracitioner in his office.  He gives natural medicine a bad name and I feel sorry for people that visit this place.  I would never ever recommend him to anyone.  There are much better options available for people seeking an integrative dental practice.  Even his hygeneist gave a sales pitch regarding additional products for sale in the office.  This place was a joke.  They are all about the $$$$. "
23,38071,1.0,"This is a biological dentist to avoid.  He is with Natural Horizons in Fairfax, VA.  He was extremely pushy to sell his services.  Did a root canal on one tooth, without any regard of leaking amalgam, since the &quot;biological chair&quot; was not available, (I guess the lucrative procedure was his only concern) and convinced me to get an inlay on an other tooth which was perfectly fine the way it was.  He simply damaged my second tooth, and left me with a painful tooth.  I did not trust him to touch my tooth again, and I had to go to another dentist to get a root canal and crown on it.  I learned a painful lesson: always get references for any dental work. "
24,38072,2.0,awful 
25,38073,1.0,By far the absolute best dentist I have ever been to.  All of the staff there are professional and courteous.  It doesn't get any better then Dr. Jeffries.  
26,38073,1.0,Great dentist!  Very friendly staff.  My whole family likes him.  Currantly have metlife.  Just took a new job and will make sure that I can keep him as my dentist. 
27,38073,1.0,Dr Jefferies is a great doctor. I highly recommand his service. I've been seing Dr Jefferies for three years and never been disappointment. 
28,38073,1.0,"I didn't think I would fine another dentist as good as my dentist back in my hometown, but I did. Dr. Jefferies may seem young, but he is knowledgeable, professional, thorough, friendly and patient.  He spent an hour and a half with me and did the cleaning portion himself (which he did a great job. My teeth felt like porcelain when he was done). He takes the time to explain things and he encourages you to ask questions.  He won't sell you anything you don't need.  He was even nice enough to bring me a couple of magazines when I had to wait. His staff is also great - very helpful and friendly.  I would highly recommend Dr. Jefferies. "
29,38073,1.0,Dr. Jefferies is great!  His bedside manner is very calming.  I am no longer anxious to go to the dentist.  Highly recommend making Dr. Jefferies your dentist. 
30,38073,1.0,"I have MetLife Insurance, which was not on the list for the review.  I chose Dr. Jefferies off of the reviews on this site.  I was not disappointed.  Dr. Jefferies spent 2 hours with me and my sorely-needing-a-cleaning mouth.  I have major dental fears, and let me say it was the most painless cleaning I have ever had.  He took time the day before Thanksgiving, his last appointment, while his staff had gone home, to give me a complete cleaning and exam.  I have never experienced a dentist going so far out of his way to take care of a patient.  I highly recommend Dr. Jefferies. "
31,38073,1.0,The staff is very helpful with all your questions. They are happy to see you and provide excellent customer service. Dr. Jefferies is a great dentist and I have recommended him to everyone I know looking for a dentist. He would be my #1 choice in the Northern VA area.  
32,38073,1.0,Helpful young doctor. Excellent treatment and overall results.  
33,38073,1.0,"Mark is an excellent yourng dentist. I would recommend him to everyone in the Herndon, Reston, Centerville area. Do not go to another dentist until you call and talk to Mark.  "
34,38074,1.0,He was extremely helpful. His knowledge was outstanding and if he didn't know about something he did his research to find out. Very kind and helpful Doctor. Highly recomended. 
35,38074,1.0,Required three weeks to return phone calls requesting treatment after diagnosis of progressive disease. You can almost see him tapping his toes while you talk to him. 
36,38075,1.0,"Very knowledgeable, appears to be very deticated to his patients and his profession, he is very through and takes the time to explain to the patient what is neccessary to maintain good health.  "
37,38075,1.0,"I have had a multitude of tests via Dr. Jain's office - stress test, CT's, etc. which I presume are necessary. Thank goodness for good insurance coverage! I have no major heart problems, but the minor ones are bothersome to me, and Dr. Jain and his staff a good at explaining what the heart is doing and what I need to do to stay healthy.  "
38,38076,2.0,. very good dr one of the best 
39,38077,1.0,"dr.joel listened to me and treated me with respect.  He is very professional and eager to make complicated situations understandable.  he doesn't give up, but finds solutions.  "
40,38077,1.0,"In January of 2010, Dr. Joel performed my vasectomy.  First, the procedure was painless. What I mean to say is that aside from getting sprayed with cold iodine I usual experience more pain following an aggressive dental cleaning than what I experienced as a result of 15 minutes of out-patient surgery. Dr Joel approached my surgery with the confidence of a trained fighter pilot. Although I'm sure that the procedure was a walk in the park for him professionally, in my eyes, no surgery below the waist is routine. Dr. Joel was professional and knew what he was doing, the same bar he had set for his assistant and office staff. I've heard from many friends about painful experiences. As someone with a low tolerance to pain myself I can only say that all doctors must not be created equal. If you are in Northern Virginia shopping for a doctor to perform your vasectomy look no further and for more complex urological issues I'd bet you would be hard pressed to find a more competent first opinion.  "
41,38077,1.0,"He treated my father for his prostate cancer. Dr Joel used the latest surgical method in his treatment and is an excellent surgeon. Provided time and care to his patients. Never felt rushed through our appointment, he explained all the options and their side affects clearly. He answered all our questions and addressed our concerns. Gave the family time to consider the treatment and once decision made he scheduled the surgery right away. He has excellent bed side manner, always seem fresh and alert even after a long day. Would recommend Dr Joel to anyone to needs an Urologist.  "
42,38078,1.0,"Dr Jacobson had me see him once before immediately scheduling a septoplasty and a turbinate reduction. After the surgery, I still could not breathe well. The Dr referred me to 4 other doctors and saw me 4 times afterwards asking for $100 each visit. Dr. Jacobson performed my surgery incorrectly and asked to do it again on my pocket. Avoid at any cost.  "
43,38078,1.0,Staff is horrible. Dr doesn't explain why or whAt will happen. Not a good doctor. Go someplace else.  
44,38078,1.0,"Jacobson, about 34, is superficially personable.  But he doesn't answer questions.  He spends 2 or 3 minutes evading then dashes out the door when one stops for a breath. That's not acceptable at $200 a visit. He is not available to his patients, but passes them off to his clerk.  I have been diagnosed  with cancer and he removed the tumor and surrounding tissue.  The biopsy report showed I was clear, but he wants to cut out more tissue and has refused to explain why this is necessary.  He has also refused to tell me how much tissue removal and the procedure.  Too much hacking and he can maim and disfigure me. I only found out the possible extent from my insurance company's pre-certification letter.  He has avoided telling me about other options. Who knows if he's knowledgeable. The only good thing is he is on time.  Well, he can't be if he spends any time with his patients.  I cannot recommend him in good conscience. "
45,38079,0.0,"She couldn't care less about helping you.  Both times I saw her, (I won't be going again) I had questions.  She told me, &quot;Not my area. Ask someone else.&quot;  I mean, that's nonsense.  I didn't ask about a foot problem, you know.  Her predecessor never behaved that way.  Dr. Jeffries acts like she can hardly stand to come down to your level.  You can't trust someone who can't talk to you.  "
46,38079,0.0,Worst expierence of my life. I was in serious pain and she would not even see my quickly. I would recommend any Dr. other than Kara Jefferies. Just awful. 
47,38079,0.0,"AMAZING!!!I can see why its so difficult to get an appt. with Kara Jefferies.  She was extremely patient, thorough and friendly, made me feel very comfortable..  Very personable and relates to you really well.  "
48,38079,0.0,"Dr. Jefferies is amazing! She took great care of me before, during, and after my surgery. Her bed side manner is wonderful and she really cares about her patients. I plan on her delivering my babies when the time comes.  :) "
49,38079,0.0,"Dr Jefferies was wonderful and helped us in our decisions for delivering our first baby via c-section. She was kind, gentle and allowed us to be a part of the medical decisions. I was very happy with her bedside manner as well.  "
50,38080,0.0,"Dr Jajodia is amazing.  She is compassionate and very skilled at getting to the issues quickly.  Her credentials are impressive - she is an internist, psychologist and psychiatrist so she approaches problems very broadly.  I appreciate her conservative approach to medication, and I feel fortunate that she accepted me as a talk therapy patient.  Her office manager, Lauren, is equally amazing.  When she learned that I had a crisis situation, she rescheduled other patients to fit me in for my first visit.  The time that I spend with Dr. Jajodia is worth every penny - I can't recommend her highly enough. "
51,38081,1.0,"Dr. Johns was there for my family when my father was very ill.  He went above and beyond to make sure he got the best care available.  He is a busy guy, but I can see why.  He is an excellent cardiologist and I would recommend him to anyone.  His staff is very friendly and helpful and they are good at returning phone calls.  If I ever need a cardiologist, I'll drive down from D.C. to see this man.  He's worth it.  "
52,38081,1.0,"I am still in shock at the total lack of compassion this man has.  I will not choose to use the Chippenham facilities for my medical needs and hope that I do not have to go there when my status is terminal.  If you do go at that time you will find yourself in the &quot;street&quot;, in panic mode and having to address issues that no one should have to think about at this time.  I feel nothing but total disgust for this physician. "
53,38081,1.0,"Dr.Johns put me at ease from the start. He is quick to have an answer and doesn't pull punches. While in the hospital, under his care, the nurse staff spoke very highly of him. I found Dr. Johns to be quite knowledgeable in his field and willing to take the time to answer all my questions. Dr. Johns does not sit around and shoot the breeze. So, when he visits, usually very early in the AM, have your questions ready and he will answer you. There will be no down time during visits.  No grass grows under his feet.He is not &quot;matter of fact&quot; in his bedside manner. He is caring, knowledgeable and accurate.  "
54,38082,2.0,An incredible dentist!  Very thorough &amp; is always on call.  
55,38083,1.0,"the staff runs this office. i wish dr. jesneck would be firmer with his receptonists, they are not nice. "
56,38084,1.0,"Dr. Johnson, contracted by the V.A. to establish disabilty claims, performed what was supposed to be an important evaluation on me that lasted maybe 10 minutes instead of 25-30. Having had numerous visits over the years, I can determine if a doctor is competent or not. For instance, he measured my leg muscles by using an industrial type metal ruler instead of the cloth kind that shapes with the leg. By doing so he had a false reading. He counted the surgical scares on my legs, and hastily measured them. That was the physical evaluation he did. He did not check knee tenderness or sublaxation. He did not perform a McMurray's test. He did not touch my legs at all except when measuring with the wrong type of ruler. He was paid for his service by the V.A.  for doing nothing! "
57,38085,0.0,"Dr.Jerez is the best She treated me with dignity and respect,and apreciated me as a patien and as a person.she is was very patient with me and made a big effort to understant me even thoug i cuoldn't really explain my problems. I thank God  for putting her on my life.  "
58,38086,0.0,"The staff and the environment were friendly at the same time very professional.  I definitely recommend them to my family and friends. Very timely precise and courteous, and she has answered all my questions patiently. "
59,38086,0.0,Love the office and doctor. She is very knowledgeable and explains every little detail. 
60,38087,1.0,"Dr. Jadidi is a great doctor...He was very helpful, knows out kid well and it always willing to make that extra phone call to help you out!I highly recommend this doctor.  "
61,38087,1.0,Very good bed side manners. He gets back to the patients promptly.  
62,38087,1.0,Best doctor i found for my daughter. I see him for past five years.   He is very knowledgeable and friendly and listens to you and very caring.  I highly recommend him to every.  Best doc in woodbridge.  Staffs are not very friendly for some reason and always have sad faces.  
63,38087,1.0,"Gentle staff.  Dr is well knowledgable in many different areas of Pediatrics. Primary hospital is Childrens in Fairfax, but has office in Woodbridge.  "
64,38088,1.0, 
65,38088,1.0,After seeing seven Doctors in the DC Metro area Dr Jabs was bar none the best! Dr Jabs and his staff treated me great from my first consultation.  I was very pleased to be his patient.  The results were better than I ever imagined and I wish I would have had the procedure done earlier! 
66,38088,1.0,"Dr. Jabs is a really an excellent doctor and has a great personality, and I will recommend him to my friends and to anyone without reservations.  He kept me informed during the whole process and what to expect before and after the procedure. "
67,38088,1.0,"My overall experience with Dr. Jabs was excellent. He thoroughly explained the procedure, gave me detailed reading material and pre-op information, and followed through with post-op reviews.He also did a good job minimizing the pain. "
68,38088,1.0,"Dr. Jabs did an amazing job with my tummy tuck, muscle repair and hernia repair!! I am totally pleased with his work. He has a great strategy for pain and symptom management with minimal side effects. My pain was never more than a 3 out of 10. My scar is healing beautifully!! I keloided with both of my c-sections but his tecnique is causing my scar to heal much much better than my c-sections. I was even able to wear a bikini in Jamaica last week, only 6 weeks post op!! :-)  Penny is McLean is super sweet and helpful! Maria is abrasive and always rubs me the wrong way but Dr. Jabs is so good that he makes it worth dealing with her abrasive personality.  I would recommend Dr. Jabs to anyone looking for the best and willing to pay to get it! This is not the type of thing to bargain shop for...  "
69,38088,1.0,Dr. Jabs was very professional and friendly throughout my consultations and procedure.  He made sure that I felt comfortable about my procedure and was very informative.  I would recommend Dr. Jabs for any of your cosmetic needs. 
70,38088,1.0,"Excellent plastic surgeon! Friendly manner, beautiful work, great follow-up care. I have had several procedures and have been very happy with Dr. Jabs. "
71,38088,1.0,"If you want breast augmentation, Dr, Jabs is the doctor for you! "
72,38088,1.0,"Dr. Jabs is an excellent plastic surgeon, he made my nose look so much better. :) "
73,38089,0.0,"She is a great  and get staff is so friendly and helpful!  When you get there, it seems like they only service elderly patients but really she is personable with everyone! She had been my family doctor since 2005 and I don't intend to switch.  I liver that she takes her time with  patient and truly cares about you.  She even acts as my gyno and does all of my pap smears... its very convenient!  I highly recommend her to anyone looking for a good quality doctor!  (don't be thrown off by her quirky, hippy clothes though! :-) ) "
74,38089,0.0,Excellent physician.  
75,38090,2.0, 
76,38091,1.0,. Had such a great experience with this dr! He us very well spoken and such a great character! Normally radiologist get such a bad rep for being rude but he was opposite! Recommend him to anyone!!! 
77,38092,1.0,"Love Dr. Jain, he is a wonderful Doctor.  He is very good with children.  "
78,38093,0.0,"Our family had so many horrible dentist experiences that we were about to give up few years ago. We meet Dr Virgil 1st time when we looking for a dentist for my mother. We chose Dr Virgil as she is extremely professional, knowledgeable, passionate and caring. She is one in a million as our family has a very high regards for her. Dr. Virgil and her staff make going to the dentist a literally pain free experience. They are extremely nice people and are very flexible regarding appointments, they are open on weekends. We never had to wait for an appointment or making any changes. Billing has also been completely seamless; they will work with you if you do not have any insurance. If you are looking for a great dentist look no further, Dr Virgil is our family dentist of over a year and we highly recommend her.  "
79,38093,0.0,She is very compassionate! Her receptionist was so helpful. I went to her office to have a tooth pulled. She called my pain meds in before the appointment. She personally called me to see how I was doing the next day. 
80,38094,2.0,"Friendly, caring, wants to go &quot;by the book&quot; though treatment may be extended. Wants to prescribe antidepressants for perimenopausal irritability.  "
81,38095,1.0,Awesome service.  I went in nerverous because of possible skin cancer.  Dr. Johnson and staff made sure that I was informed of every move. Not only did he take good care of me he alao made sure that I was okay after hours.  Dr.  Johnson is a truly great doctor/surgeon! 
82,38095,1.0,"The staff and Dr. Johnson were awesome.  They were able to see me right away (the same day that I called!) and everyone was quite friendly, helpful and efficient.  Dr. Johnson was very &quot;down to earth&quot; making it easy to discuss my skin issues with him.  I had a very pleasant experience with this office and would highly recommend it to others. "
83,38095,1.0,Dr. Johnson takes the extra steps needed to ensure his patient''s needs are met. What''s impressive is his insight to a person''s emotional well being..a rare trait for a surgeon. 
84,38096,2.0,"Best cardiologist that I ever had. Takes time to really listen to patients and is willing to discuss,candidly, treatment plans. Helped me through very difficult time prior to heart transplant.  "
85,38097,0.0,I have had Dr Johnson for over 10 years.  She is the best of MCVH.  I refer co-workers to her as well as my family and friends.   AWSOME!!! 
86,38098,1.0,"Dr. Janousek is one of the most professional, compassionate, and honorable MD's that I have met in a long time. Being military, I have seen many Doctors from all over the country and I would rate him as one of the best I have seen, if not THE BEST!! I would recommend his services to any family.  "
87,38099,1.0,"Worst dentist ever! Don't go here if you want reasonable treatment, good care, and a competent dentist . Dr. Johnson is rude and rough. I looked him up, and he doesn't belong to the local dental society. Why not&#63; Very ,very, expensive also. Doesn't work with you and your insurance at all. Uncaring staff.  Stay away! "
88,38099,1.0,"Dr. Johnson has a very calm and gentle manner and is good about explaining his treatment. The staff takes good care of you, has always been able to fit me and my family in when there have been dental emergencies, and there have been absolutely no problems with billing. The practice is very &quot;techonology-forward&quot; as well.  "
89,38099,1.0,"Awesome dentist, Dr. Johnson! He is very gentle and calm which relaxes you. The staff is extremely friendly and works with your needs.  "
90,38099,1.0,The office staff is great about getting you in and very flexible when you need to change an appointment.  They are also great in reminding you of your appointment.  Dr.  Johnson is VERY GOOD!  I would recommend him and his staff to anyone! 
91,38099,1.0,"Dr. Johnson is amazing. He has a quiet, soothing voice and is very gentle, which helps because I have anxiety about going to the dentist. My only complaints are that there is one female dentist there that talks down to you; I was in tears. Also, they've gotten super busy, and perhaps lost a dentist or two, I'm not sure. It's hard to get a quick appointment, which is bad if you're in a lot of pain. But when I do get in, Dr. Johnson takes his time and explains everything to me. He's great. And their office looks amazing after the renovation! "
92,38099,1.0,"I have had two cavities filled at Dr. Johnson's office, along with other routine care, over the past year and a half. The hygenists have been good, but I have not been happy with any of the dentists. Each time, I have seen a different dentist. The first doctor was fine, but was no longer practicing there when I returned in 6 months. The next dentist, I saw there (Dr. Gomez) was horrible! She was rude, rushed and unfriendly. Dr. Johnson's office seems to have a revolving door of dentists, whereas I would prefer to see the same person at least a few times in a row. I have given this office three chances, and have been unhappy with the visits 3 out of 5 times. I will not be returning to Dr. Johnson's office.  "
93,38099,1.0,"Incredible dentist, but very expensive. Their office will NEVER keep you waiting longer than maybe 5 minutes tops. I have never experienced any pain with this dentist, and I am a pretty hard patient to deal with. He is an artist. I had a bridge done that should be put in the Louvre. I highly recommend him if you have really good dental insurance, if not, be prepared to pay. They do not give discounts for paying cash. "
94,38100,1.0,Dr. Johnson was extermely patient with me. He answered all my questions in terms I could understand. I would highly recommend him.  
95,38101,0.0,Dr.Jha has the bedside manner of a &quot;Rattlesnake&quot;  She assumes before asking or listening to her patients.   she rushes thru her appointments and shows no compassion for her patients.  Her nurse is another story in itself.  
96,38101,0.0,Dr.Jha has immense knowledge &amp; grip on her subject. She does not mince words and gives a correct picture to patients. I have had a wonderful experience dealing with her and will not hesitate to recommend her to anyone... ! 
97,38101,0.0,She has a bad bedside manner.  Told me I may have to learn to live with my discomfort.  That was her diagnosis! 
98,38101,0.0,Dr. Jha is a wonderful doctor.  Her nurses are very kind and helpful.  She has no problem with referring you to a specialist and having tests ordered to get a complete picture of any health problems.  I would highly recommend her to anyone! 
99,38101,0.0,"This doctor does not care about her patients nor does she have an appropriate bedside manner. She is known to say things like &quot;The only thing wrong with you is that you're old,&quot; to elderly patients. This woman should be fired.  "
100,38101,0.0,Appears so uncaring and eager to terminate visit.  
101,38102,1.0,TMS really helped me. TMS helped my with my depression when the drugs didnt. Anyone who has depression issues should at least try TMS therapy. I WORKED FOR ME! 
102,38102,1.0,"I have been a patient of Dr. Jennings since 2003&#63;.  He is VERY knowledgable and helpful.  Is always willing to try different meds.   He is usually running behind, (lol) but his skills and helpfulness bypass this small issue! "
103,38102,1.0,great doctor. wish i could reach a pager for him or something right now. i'm having double vision and i just started new meds! *sigh* 
104,38102,1.0,"Ihave been going to this doctor for 14 years. He knows what he is doing and is absolutely the best with his knowledge, education and the same is true with medication. He also knows alot about not only depression, but CFS and FM and alot of women's issues.  "
105,38102,1.0,. Great doctor! You would have to be CRAZY not to go see him!! 
106,38102,1.0,"Dr Jennings has a dry sense of humor and he does not put you down. He listens to you, and he lets you participate in your own care.  "
107,38102,1.0,"Slight problem with punctuality, but very apologetic. Genuinely seems to want to help people. A wealth of information and yet a very down to earth guy who can talk normal instead of insisting on doctor-ese. Would recommend him any day to friends, family, colleages and strangers.  "
108,38103,1.0,"Dr. Johns was by far the best md I've ever been too. I had terrible pelvic pain as well as what I was told by another obgyn &quot;blocked Fallopian tubes&quot; dr johns performed a laparoscopy on me to find out I had endometriosis and my Fallopian tubes infact were not blocked. All within 2 weeks, I had my first appt, surgery and my follow up appt.  now I no longer have pain and I am told I will be able to have children (which the last obgyn I went to told me I could only have children of I did invitro) "
109,38103,1.0,"After seeing several doctors without success, I consulted Dr. Johns about my pelvic pain. He correctly diagnosed my problem as endometriosis. His personal care and expert treatment has relieved my symptoms. I highly recommend him to my family and friends.  "
110,38103,1.0,I feel this office puts you first. I had chronic pain for the last 7 years. I had a partial hysterectomy. I'm pain free. I would recommend him to anyone. His staff is wonderful and make you very comfortable.  Thank you all for being so kind! 
111,38103,1.0,"I would not recommend Dr. johns for surgery, he operated on me and I ended up with Septis Infection in ICU for 3 1/2 weeks, he seemed to care less about the situation.  "
112,38103,1.0,Dr. Johns is the most talented and knowledgeable MD I've ever known.  He diagnosed my problem very quickly when no one else could over a period of several years.  I'm not just a number in his practice.  He always takes the time to listen to me and address my concerns.  I recommend Dr. Johns to everyone who needs a gyn.  
113,38103,1.0,I believe he is one of the best in his field.   He is very caring 
114,38103,1.0,"Dr Johns is awesome. At 34 years old the last thing I wanted to do is go through menopause, he made it so easy for me to understand what was going on and provided me with choices. When I had to have surgery he was extremely understanding, thoughtful and knowledgeable.   I would recommend Dr Johns to any woman I know! "
115,38103,1.0,He did the TVT Sling. His treatment of me was as if I was the only one in the room. The staff has been some of the best I have ever encountered.  
116,38103,1.0,He doesn't listen to his female patients. Rude when he talks to the nurse while the patient is in the room. Treats you like you're invisable when you have a question.  
117,38104,2.0,Saved my life. I'm free of all my bizarre OCD rituals and thought patterns. 
118,38105,2.0,Seemed very knowledgable and explained issues in simple terms. Had no problem answering questions.  
119,38106,1.0,"I changed eye doctors to go to Dr Jessup. Super nice man. Cares very much for his patients. Staff is great as well, Very satisfied, would recommend him to everyone. "
120,38106,1.0,"He is so friendly and concerned for every patient that comes in. I've gotten to know him over the years, and I can't think of a better doctor in the Roanoke Valley. Also, he just got a new building that is really cool!!! "
121,38107,1.0,"Dr. Jaffe is the world's best doctor. i'm 23 and just stopped going to him since i had to move. you will never find a more compassionate, dedicated or knowledgeable doctor. He will not stop taking care of you until you are better. good about trying to use solutions that don't require prescriptions, but also good at knowing when to use them. totally selfless. not only that, but he is known as richmond's best diagnostic. he will help you, protect you, listen to you and keep you well. i love dr. jaffe.  "
122,38107,1.0,I am 36 years old. Jaffe treated me with a rare skin disease and was my primary physician when I was 3 years old until I was in my late teens. Jaffe will cut off his own leg if he thought it would help you. Hands down the best doctor on the planet. 
123,38107,1.0,"Dr. Jaffe is incredibly dedicated. You will never find a better doctor. If you are sick, he will not stop taking care of you until you are well. He checked on my brother in the hospital every evening for a week after his office hours to check on him. He has been practicing for something ridiculous like 35 years. He also teaches at MCV. His ethics are truly admirable. He can diagnose obscure problems better than any SPECIALIST I've ever gone to. I'm 22 and still go to him because I know I'll never find a better doctor. Great with parents. Seems a little serious at first, but he has a warm heart. A great doctor and wonderful human being.  "
124,38108,1.0,. He is a wonderful dentist - I would definitely recommend him and his office! The staff is amazing and he's brilliant! 
125,38109,1.0,"Went for neck pain. First time waited over 2 hours, gave me an injection to the neck with no numbing! about 6-7 needles very painfull! Talking and joking about unrelated stuff while doing the injection!  Also mentioned odd things to me like from looking at my tongue could tell I was depressed.    weird, insensitive to patinet's pain and condition! Obviously was my first and last him to go to him! "
126,38109,1.0,"Went for neck pain.  First time waited over an hour, gave me some exercises and sent me for extensive blood work.  Second time waited about an hour and told me blood work was good.  Did some odd things and mentioned odd things like from looking at my tongue could tell I was depressed long ago. Also had some butterfly redness on my face meaning some arthritis.  Only thing besides exercises he did was do something with some russian taser that he said was used for astronauts.   All way too weird for me! "
127,38110,2.0,. Very personal 
128,38111,1.0,"I have been going to Dr. Jessup for 18 years and would recommend him to anyone.  In my experience, he has always been friendly, knowledgeable and prompt, has a great staff and an excellent touch when giving anesthesia, etc.  "
129,38111,1.0,"Not very good bedside manner.  Very little patience.  Will not answer questions nicely, when asked.  Just my opinion.   Mind is someplace else when working in your mouth. "
130,38112,0.0,"Nill, poor, Always late,Rude,ignorant. careless,mannerlessand at the end i will say she is not a human being her liscence should be cancel "
131,38112,0.0,"Dr.Jahan is the worst doctor I have ever seen!  She was rude,insulting and rough during the exam.  I would not recommend this doctor to anyone! After having such a horrible experience with Dr.Jahan herself I decided not to go back.  I had to call her office over 6 times in attemps to have her staff simply fax over my records to my new doctor.  Every time I called they would blow me off.  Between Dr. Jahan and her office staff I would say I have never had to deal with a group of such incompotent, uncaring, and disrespectful people! "
132,38112,0.0,"I hesitate to refer to this person as a doctor.  She has no regard or respect for her patients, is rude and arrogant, medically uninformed and incompetent.  She lectured my teen foster daughter who is on Medicaid about how she is a leach on the system and needs to get a job and stop wasting the government's money.  She lost the results of the sonogram and made no attempt and had no interest in trying to get them.  We waited 3 hrs for the appt. with no apology for being late.  She was incompetent in her drug dosage prescription and then lied about having done it (its documented on the prescription form).  She should not be allowed to practice medicine anywhere.  "
133,38112,0.0,"started out rude, but i was stern with her. she got strait to the point and was very helpful in explaining things not understood.  listened to our concerns as well.  "
134,38112,0.0,"I would not recommend this doctor to anyone. They had a blood drawn and my sugars were very high at that time. No one called me from the doctor's office and I didn't have a chance to followup with her after that. I had to find that I had diabetes 2 months later and my sugars were overboard by that time.  No one was responsible to call with the blood work in her office. It was totally frustrating. During most of my visits I had to wait for a long time, first in the reception and then in the room for almost 2-3 hours.  "
135,38112,0.0,This Doctor is very unprofessional and only concerned with the almight dollar.  Her Office is not Ohsa compliant.  Her staff is not licensed.  She is rude to her paitents and staff has no regard for the way she treats either.  I do not recommend anyone see her. 
136,38112,0.0,This Doctor is rude and disrespectful to all her staff and patients...I think she needs to retire or GET LAID! 
137,38112,0.0,Lack of practical experience.Not good for any operation like MR and D&C.Her; staffs are very unhelpful.Does not maintain punctuality.Too much professional and not so friendly.  
138,38112,0.0,she does not like to communicate about any results and wants you to get an appointment each time and her staff is very disorganized as well. 
139,38112,0.0,"I've seen this dr,about 10 years not and each time I regrated! very unprofessional, bad attitude, not friendly doctor.the staff  areevery 2-3 months.The way the doctor talks to her staff is very rude mean and this can be the reason they leave after a short term of working there. She does not answer any questions, she would love you to get an appointment each time if you have any question!! She loves money , I guess!! she would not answer your question if it is not related to her diagnosis for that day! she would ask you go back a weak later if you want to know when to take your pill , for example!~ I am so not satisfy with this dr.  My last visit with her was because My papsmear was abnormal and she said she needs to do a kind of treatment, after treatment she did another paps' but the result is still abnormal,she now asked me to go for another treatment so it might be working! she is not sure thought!That is why this time I am not going to take this anymore and looking for other GYNO "
140,38112,0.0,"YES! Dr.  Jahan is generally late! However, Jahan is not a Practice and can not be with 5 patients at one time, therefore when you rate her attention to you and the service she provides, it's so worth the wait! As a patient you need to evaluate the service to your time, and no ones time is more important than her excellent service! "
141,38112,0.0,"We visited this DR twice and each time almost cried of why we were there. Very, very, very un-professional, total disregard of patient's feeling. If you make any comment about what you want and traditional or normal birthing etc, be prepared to be yelled at. The way staff are treated by the Dr is also very terrible. I just don't know how long she can keep practising unless she takes customer services or communication classes.I don't even want start talking about the wait. When  you get there, you better have half of the day free up or you will start getting mad after the first hour passes.  "
142,38112,0.0,"Dr. Jahan is great if you want a c-section on her time.  She did a great job on the emergency c-section for my first.  When I was pregnant with my second I told her that I wanted a VBAC.  She told me that she wanted me to have a c-section because (her exact words) &quot;It is inconvenient for me to attend VBACs.&quot;  She only would consent to &quot;let&quot; me have a VBAC if I consented to have labor induced and augmented with pitocin.  The drug combination would have increased my risk of uterine rupture from 1/7000 to 1/25.  Thankfully I was educated about the risks of a VBAC compared to the risks of a repeat c-section.  Personally, I considered her plans for my VBAC to be deliberate malpractice and consequently I would NOT recommend her AT ALL if you want a VBAC.  But, she does do good work for a c-section if you're fool enough to want one.  "
143,38112,0.0,"Always VERY late.  Dr. Jahan did communicate well with me, once I finally saw her.  I saw her primarily for yearly visits and dreaded each because they are over 2 hours!  I have since moved on to another OB/GYN (Dr. Kathy Wolfe).  I would highly recommend her.  "
144,38112,0.0,"This office lost my records.  I called both offices to find my chart and the staff made no effort to help me, in fact, they like hanging up on the phone on their patients.  Dr. Jahan never returned my calls.  This is by far my worst experience and I'll be taking legal actions!  They even revealed my bloodwork OVER THE PHONE which is illegal.   This office is completely unprofessional! "
145,38112,0.0,Dr. Jahan is always a minimum of 30 minutes late. Her office is highly disorganized and frequently does not communicate lab results. Dr. Jahan does care about her patients but does not manage her time well.  
146,38113,2.0,"The office staff is really rude.  I called three times for a referral.  Each time I was told to make an appointment and call back for refferal. I make an appointment and call back when the office staff quotes Office Plolicy,'Have to See Dr. Jalla First&quot;.  Why on earth did they not tell me when I called three times about the refferal.  Was very rude phone.  "
147,38114,1.0,He has excellent communication skills. He spent a good amount of time with me and now I understand Diabetes so much better. My last a1c level was 6.2. I highly recommend him. 
148,38115,1.0,"Dr. Jakum had written my son's ADHD medication rx for over a year and decided he needed a new psych eval. He told us he would not write another rx until we got the eval.  We had the evaluations done, but didn't have the results yet due to insurance/provider change and my son was out of meds.  He would not write one more month without the eval.  He would not even call to explain why he would not write it.  He drew a line in the sand regardless of the effect no medication would have on my son at school and in spite of the opinion of the psych office.  Needless to say we have changed pediatricians.  "
149,38115,1.0,". Absolutely wonderful doctor! He is very good at being patient and answering what you think would be ridiculous questions, I have recommended him to 4 friends already, if he moved to a practice 2 hours away, I'd drive the distance for him to stay my sons doctor! "
150,38115,1.0,"Terrible and disorganized staff.  They misspelled our child's name on the first visit and then ended up having 2 files for the child.  After 3 visits, it still wasn't corrected.  Jakum is competent, knowledgeable and kind, but the office is like a factory and despite seeing Jakum 3x in a 2 month time period, he had no clue who we were.  His nurse is very incompetent - almost stuck our baby with the wrong needle, but realized the mistake and then pointed it out to us, which I'm not sure we actually needed to know.  "
151,38115,1.0,"Dr. Jakum is extremely clinical and if he does not have the answer he refers to outside experts immediately.  While he is extremely knowledgeable, he still retains a warm bedside manner for your child.  With Dr.  Jackum you know your child is getting the best medical treatment possible and what more could you ask for as a parent! "
152,38115,1.0,Dr. Jakum is very friendly and takes time to really talk with you and your child. He is incredibly thorough. Very upbeat and charismatic. I have never been made to feel rushed while my child and I are with him. He takes the time to really listen and take action. He is a good person which is why he is such a great doctor.  
153,38116,1.0,"He never even examined my hip and almost sent me off for 3 weeks without any advice or direction for home care when I couldn't even walk, sit or lie down. Only after I questioned him repeatedly did he look at my xray again. That is when he noticed a possible fractured femur. Really&#63; At least at that point he ordered an MRI.  "
154,38117,0.0,"Jalber mis diagnosed a lump in my sisters breast- dismissed it as a milk duct a year later was found out to be cancer stage 1-2, She is fast to dismiss any concerns and she does not listen to her patients. I am hoping that anyone looking for a Primary Care Physician would check rating like this to avoid using doctors that are out there doing harm to their patients.  "
155,38118,0.0,"Do not recommend.  She does not listen, and does not spend time with you.   You end up seeing nurses. "
156,38118,0.0,". she is thorough, Understanding, knowledgeable, great surgeon which I needed because I had to have very evasive c-section, thoughtful, friendly, "
157,38118,0.0,"Dr. Jefferson is the best OB-GYN in the area!  She is very knowledgeable.  She actually takes time with her patients, thoroughly explains, listens attentively. She is an excellent obstetrician for high-risk or no-risk preganancies and general gynecology.  She is personable and genuinely cares about her patients.  I wouldn't see anyone else! "
158,38119,1.0,"Dr. Jay is the best! He is caring, kind, professional, and always looks out for your best interest. He knows that the visit to the dentist can make many people anxious and he always tries his to put you at ease. I have had major work done through him (titanium implant and crown) and also regular dental work (fillings, cleanings etc.) and he has always been stellar. I hear he is also excellent with children. I have recommended him to everyone I care about and they feel the same. I recently got three cavities filled and he contacted me personally by phone the next day to check on how I was doing. He sent me a lovely thank you not note when I referred a new patient to him. His staff are always on top of things, they are also excellent and caring people. Dr. Jay is one of the best in the area and his practice is thriving because he shows that he cares about his patients.  "
159,38120,1.0,Its always nerve wrecking to go to a new doctor but the staff made me feel very at ease and Dr. Johnson was very helpful and answered all of my questions. I would highly recommend him.  
160,38120,1.0,does  not accept voice message outside of hours; has no web presence or email capability.   Prescription desk response to messages very slow 
161,38120,1.0,"I found him to be mostly unhelpful when asking about how autoimmune disorders could affect the schedule to get infant vaccinations.  But worst of all, they are fascists about getting a social security number, and will demand it.  My insurance company was amazed they did this, as no one else does so.  This office is an identity theft incident waiting to happen. "
162,38120,1.0,Dr Johnson is a very caring person and takes time to listen to what you have to say.  He is very knowledgable and has helped me alot 
163,38121,1.0,"Dr. Jackomis is excellent at small talk and he seems very genuine.  This helped put me at ease (I hadn't been to a dentist in over 5 years).  He was very thorough and he explained everything.  He wasn't pushy.  He took the time to ask questions, both related and not related to denistry.  My experience was good and I plan on becoming on returning.  "
164,38121,1.0,We love Dr. Jackomis.....I have read the other comments about him being too personal.....it's only because he truly cares so much about each patient....people have forgotten what true caring is because we see it so infrequently.  The quality of his work is second to none and we would choose him over any doctor &quot;in Network&quot;.....he is worth the extra $.  I disagree with the people that say he pushes for more work instead of just doing the basics.....Dr. Jackomis will explain your options and let you decide....but he always gives you alternatives.  
165,38121,1.0,Absolutely the most care professional I have visited in years.   Staff is exremely patient oriented and very helpful 
166,38121,1.0,"Other comments here are right on- Dr. J is a great dentist and cares about doing a good job.  I've been a patient for about 4 years, having been referred by a work colleague after moving to the area. He will call you back personally and come in on the weekends for emergencies, and you don't get that too often! It's said that your strengths are also your weaknesses, and I agree w/ the other posters here - he's far too personal for a dentist (I don't want to talk politics in the chair - that's what the weather is for; he asks for postcards from patients on vacation, and advertises them via the display on the front desk - I can barely crank out a card to my mom much less my DENTIST - what's up w/ that&#63;). And one poster noted that he uses the very latest technology, but sometimes &quot;appropriate technology&quot; is called for.  Dr. J won't do a simple filling if he can do an inlay/onlay/ceramic thing.  He is always pushing for the latest new treatment, which I don't always feel I need. "
167,38121,1.0,"I've been to other dentists, Dr. Jackomis really cares about you as an individual and your family.  He loves being a dentist and it shows, he is very intelligent, he has a law degree and went to Notre Dame.  If you are looking for a dentist with alot of professionalism and personality, he's the one.  "
168,38121,1.0,"my parents found rick a few years ago and could not stop talking about how good he is. they had used some great dentists in the area, but they had retired so they had to find a new one. he uses all the latest techniques and equpiment. the one thing that sets him apart is that he is honest, and practices actual medicine...he is very talented. he filled a cavity for me and i felt absolutely nothing; and he did not numb me with novacaine; he used a really cool laser device that numbs the nerves to a particular tooth. his whole staff cares, and his dental hygenist is very good (she teaches hygene at night at an area college). go see him..you wont be sorry. "
169,38121,1.0,Waited 30 minutes for appointment. Dr. Rick is too personal. I was very uncomfortable with his questions and comments.  
170,38122,1.0,Dr. Jamison is a wonderful doctor in all aspects. He is very caring and listens to what you have to say and how you feel. I've been a patient for 3 years now and have no intentions of changing.  
171,38122,1.0,"Very caring, very knowledgeable, and will spend as much time as necessary.  "
172,38122,1.0,The very best doctor around.  Has excellent bed-side manners.  
173,38122,1.0,"Dr. Jamison is the best.  Listens - really listens to what you say, does not prescribe tests or prescriptions without proper reason.  Takes time to talk and provide patient involvement in treatment and cares about patients.  Not quick to diagnose go get you out of the office and on to the next patient.  Highly recommend.   I've been his patient for over 10 years "
174,38122,1.0,Excellent physician.  Very patient & caring demeanor.  Extremely knowledgeable and very willing to answer patient's questions to their level of understanding.  Staff also exceptionally helpful and friendly.  
175,38123,0.0,Horrible doctor. Very unprofessional and has an attitude problem.  She start yelling at my wife and I in the reception area telling us that she doesn't care because we have MEDICAID. Shuld quit doctor !!!!!! 
176,38123,0.0,I have seen dr jahan recently. what is different about dr jahan from other drs is that she works very fast . she saw me and started the treatment right away without wasting any time. she captured what my problem was right away .she gave me proper medication.I feel a lot better.I am glad that I went to her for my treatment .Every time I went to her office she was on time . 
177,38123,0.0,"It dosent take a real expert to realize doctor Jahan may need to be checked on herself. She has an attitude beyond imaginable. For god sakes im coming for your advice, not to get yelled at! I will never walk back into her office again, I can assure you this is not where you want to go! Take your money and your health issues to someone who actually makes you feel important.  "
178,38123,0.0,"I have been a patient of Dr. Jahan’s for over a year.  I was referred to her after suffering a stroke.  She began treatment by performing an examination that fully characterized my overall condition, established a baseline of my condition and began a treatment program that was a combination of rehabilitation and stabilization of my condition to reduce the likelihood of another stroke.  I liked that approach and the desired outcome.  Her professional approach and treatment plan was very reassuring.  Her office staff is equally effective in dealing with their workload.  While on a trip I found myself running low on medications and called her office.  The staff phoned a “Bridge” prescription to a local pharmacy and I picked it up and didn’t miss taking a prescribed medication on time.  "
179,38123,0.0,The most compassionate and respectful physician I have ever met. I am so happy to have found Dr. Jahan. She sat with me and answered all my questions and addressed all my concerns. The staff is great and works with you to ease your worries.  
180,38123,0.0,"My mother has recently become a patient of Dr Jahan's for treatment of neck pain and numbness in her arm following a traffic accident.  Since I live out of state from my mother, I wanted to get some feedback on her new Dr. I must say I was very concerned by some of the comments posted on this site, but also realize that people are often more likely to speak out when they have a complaint than when they are completely satisfied. Nevertheless, I felt it was important for me to get a first hand impression of my mother's care, since the last thing I wanted was for someone to just overmedicate her with strong pain pills and send her home to stumble around and possibly fall! I planned a visit to my mother to accompany her to her next appt with Dr. Jahan and what a relief! She was courteous-referring to my mother as &quot;madame&quot;-she was professional and knowledgeable.   Best of all she is helping my mother get relief from her pain and numbness without the risks of narcotics for an older patient! "
181,38123,0.0,"After having read the reviews on Dr. Jahan, I was skeptical to become her patient. However a friend of mine, who went through a series of inexperienced and impolite neurologists before finding Dr. Jahan, strongly encouraged me to visit her. I now can thank my friend for introducing me to the most compassionate and thorough physician I have ever met.  Dr. Jahan made my condition her primary concern. While treating me she also focused on building a patient-physician relationship with me which made me view her as trustworthy and responsible. I think that those who have rude and incorrect statements to make about Dr. Jahan where probably seeking narcotics or false sick leaves/ immigration forms as opposed to real treatment and after Dr. Jahan was able to see right through their motives they in turn wrote such false reviews as a form of revenge. My response is to take my advice: if you are looking for an intelligent, caring, and thorough neurologist go to Dr. Jahan.  "
182,38123,0.0,"Having accompanied my wife to an appointment with Dr. Sheila Jahan, I would like to honestly ask: what is this woman doing in the medical profession&#63;  My wife was experiencing a tingling sensation in her arms and legs and wanted to be examined.  When Dr. Jahan entered the room, she started firing questions quickly at my wife.  My wife, who is not a native speaker of English and was very distraught about her condition, tried to answer as best as she could.  The first time my wife did not understand Dr. Jahan (who also has a thick foreign accent), yelled at her and proceeded to interview me concerning my wife's condition!!! After firing three questions at me, she preformed the most perfunctory neurological exam imaginable (i.e. can you move your legs and arms&#63;) and stormed out of the room saying my wife should see a psychiatrist.  I was appalled!!!!! "
183,38123,0.0,"I have been seeing Dr. Jahan since 2007.  Thankfully she has some new staff now and they are much better.  They recognize regular patients and are efficient and capable. Dr. Jahan is a godsend.  I see her for chronic migraines which greatly interfered with my life before she helped me.  She stepped in where other doctors had let me down, ran a battery of tests in order to ensure that there were no life threatening problems, and got me on a regular course of medication to treat them.  She insists on regular annual checkups to adjust the medication if necessary and to check on any side effects.  I find her manner to be professional, caring, and compassionate, and she has a good sense of humor.  In fact, she is my favorite doctor.  "
184,38123,0.0,"As the nurse walked me back, I asked, “where are your business license and the doctor’s credentials”. The nurse walked out of the room and said, “oh they are here, she took me to a blank wall, than she said “oh no it’s not here let me get the doctor”. When the doctor arrived I knew than something was wrong because she was hostile. So,I asked “where are your business license and your medical credentials”&#63; She said “in my office in Alexandria”, I said, “well I need to see them before you can provide services to my son”.  She became Irate and said “leave my office now”, I said “I am”.  On my way out, I asked the receptionist for the doctors card  and a pen, by that time doctor Jahan was behind me screaming “get out get out”. When I got outside I realized she had my check and the forms that I filled out with my social security number on them so, I wanted it back.  I called the police so they could help me retrieve these things.  The Dr. lacked the care and compassion doctors posses.  "
185,38123,0.0,"OMG! This supposed doctor kept telling me I was dying. Not 1X ,not 2X but 3X in 60 days!! 1st time she said the arteries in my brain were clogged and my brain wasn't getting enuff blood &amp; oxygen. The 2nd time she said the corteroid artery in my neck was kinked. Again, my brain was suffering. I only had between 1 day to 1 yr to live. Supposedly I was just going to drop dead one day. I warned my boss, family, friends, everybody I knew. I wanted them to be prepared and I even told them &quot;goodbye forever&quot;. That was 10 yrs ago. I felt like an idiot. I forgot why I was supposed to die the 3rd time but I finally went to another dr. He sat next to me, showed me HER test results, explained them in detail and said I was perfectly healthy and not dying. I called her staff (who were mostly teenagers at the time) and told them what I thought of her. It wasn't pleasant for them but I'm sure it's why I'm still alive, happy and healthy today. It was my STRESS RELIEF to get rid of her from my life.  "
186,38123,0.0,Wish I had read other reviews before going to this provider. One of the worst one for sure that I have ever seen. A guy at blockbuster store will give you more time and service for your couple af bucks spent there then this one for thousands she will charge for her service. AVOID! 
187,38123,0.0,"Doctor Jahan has been my doctor since about 2000.  She has always been helpful and listened to me.  I suffered from seizures, migraines and back pain.  I would recommend her to anyone.  "
188,38123,0.0,"My PCP referred me to Dr. Jahan's office due to the pain I've been experiencing in my hands...my hands!  After the technician finished the first part of my exam...Dr. Jahan decided she wasn't going to show up today for work, so I had to reschedule the second part which took all but 10 minutes after waiting 25 minutes to be seen.  Dr. Jahan did not explain what she was about to do to me..when I asked questions she brushed me off...wrote me two prescriptions (which I'm getting a second opinion on) and walked out of the room yelling at one of her other patients children...I had blood running down both my legs...i ran out of there like a bat out of hell!!!! I felt like complete garbage when I left that woman's office...I personally think she writes herself prescriptions since she seemed very figgity and aggitated...I wouldn't recommend Dr. S. Jahan to my worst enemy (if I had any)!!! My advice...BEWARE..BEWARE..BEWARE "
189,38123,0.0,"I saw Dr. Jahan three times. I should have turned around and left before my first visit. In fact, I almost did, because the office is so unkempt. However, I was experiencing severe neck pain and stayed. She performed an unnecessary, expensive (and painful) test (and also sent me for an MRI, which was probably appropriate) and then gave me a goody bag of medication, none of which did anything good.  On my last visit, when I asked if my troubles would lead to a compromised posture, she replied, &quot;We women lose so much as we age.&quot;  My impression is that Dr. Jahan is far more interested in your money than your health. My advice:  Beware! "
190,38123,0.0,"I was referred to Dr. Jajan by an insurance company. They never sent her my medical records, she did not request my records and never told me that she did not have any medical records on me.  Based on this she made a medical determination that nothing was wrong with me, insulted me my calling me a fake and telling me that I was ripping off the system.  She was very unethical, rude and her failure to get my records indicates her incompetency. "
191,38123,0.0,"Dr. Sheila Jahan lacks the compassion that most doctors naturally have. Although she has the credentials to be a neurologist, she does not have the mannerisms of one. Use this information to your advantage, and find another neurologist.  "
192,38123,0.0,"I have been a patient of Dr.Jahan's for over 5 years. She is highly educated, well-trained, very qualified, and a remarkably experienced medical doctor. I have consistently found her medical advise to be fundamentally sound and relevant. Moreover, she is a thorough, compassionate, and effective medical professional.For those who need the services of a highly qualified and experienced neurologist, without hesitation, I strongly recommend Dr. Jahan.  "
193,38123,0.0,"After suffering for a long time with severe migrains and going to 5 different specialist I finally got some relief after Dr. Jahan treated me. She took me off of all my medications and treated me with one medicine that has cured me. She was very warm and understanding. She immediately ran a series of tests that other doctors failed to run. She was very thorough and very knowledgable. Her staff is very friendly. One girl has a bit of a strong accent, but otherwise is great and helpful.  "
194,38123,0.0,"Went to see Dr. Jahan for an unknown problem on 3 occasions. Each time she was late by more than 30 mins, on one occasion I had to leave the practice (with a 30 minute commute back to work myself) because she was so late in travelling between her 2 practices. I was effectively diagnosed through nothing other than a brief conversation, having had the problem baffle 2 neurologists and a neuropsychiatrist in the past, and handed some trial medication in front of people sitting in the waiting room. One staff member quit in front of me, and another gave me the 'answers' to a test I was having to determine whether I could sense hot/cold on my face.  "
195,38124,1.0,"I was not happy after this Dr. did a colonoscopy on me. Told me I had diverticulitis when I was half asleep. I called back later to talk to him about this diagnois, his staff wouldnt let me talk to him. I was told I would have to make an appt in order to talk to him about this condition. I don't even want to go back to him now. You pay so much for the colonoscopy  and then you can't talk to the Dr about it without making an appointment. I would not recommend him.  "
196,38125,2.0,"This was the doctor taking the x-rays, but was very kind and took the time to ask about my kids and hobbies.  All the doctors at this office listen to you and seem very sincere in wanting to help, not just give me another drug! "
197,38126,1.0,I travel 1 1/2 hrs each way - he was great!I would recommend alwayshe gave me tons of time and was caring.  
198,38126,1.0,"Dr. Timothy Johnson is very arrogant and does talk down to you if he feels you question him. I will not see him again. The staff is nice and friendly. Hopefully Dr. David Johnson has a better bedside manner but I am not going to stick around to see. There are too many other Ortho. doctors in the area to have to deal with the arrogance. Also, he chewed my WC case manager out for asking one simple question on my behalf.  "
199,38126,1.0,"I saw Dr. Johnson for pain in my shoulder.  He gave me a cortisone injection in my shoulder.  When he injected the needle; blood squirted out like geyser.  I’ve had numerous cortisone injections in my shoulders; and no doctor has ever done the injection in the top front of my shoulder; rather the back top.   The next day I had a bruise 2 inches long and an inch wide (I have never had a bruise before or since from an injection); and more pain than before.  When the pain nor bruising had not subsided a week later, I called his office.  They told me to come in to have it checked.  When I arrived, they wanted my co-pay.  I told them I’m not paying for co-pay for a visit necessitated by the doctor’s injection. I just walked out.   Some weeks later I had a cortisone injection in my shoulder from a Physicians Assistant in the top back of my shoulder:   no blood squirting, no bruising; and pain almost gone in a week.  I would not trust Dr. Johnson to give me another cortisone injection; let alone perform shoulder surgery on me.  "
200,38126,1.0,Dr. Tim Johnson was very helpful regarding my hip problem.  He spend a great deal of time with me discussing the various options.  Good recommendations.  
201,38126,1.0,Dr. Timothy Johnson has the worst bed side manner I have ever come across. He was rude and talked down to me.  I would not recommend this doctor to anyone.  He seemed like he didn't want to assist me with my medical issue and talked down to me for trying to tell him about my condition. 
202,38126,1.0,"This practice is run by Dr. David Johnson & Dr. Timothy Johnson.  It is a new facility and the staff is extremely friendly.  Dr. Timothy Johnson was very comprehensive, spending at least 30 mins doing the initial assessment.  I have heard from many people who are not from the Lansdowne area that they would drive the distance to go to this clinic.  I recommend these guys to anyone looking for comprehensive orthopedic care! "
203,38127,2.0,Dr Johnson is Allways ready to help!!! 
204,38128,1.0,"My daughter found Dr John Jane, Jr on the internet  when I found out I had a pituitary tumor, He is a  great Dr. and has a great personality, talks to you like he has known you for years, He did emergency surgery on me Nov 2008 , HE IS A LIFE SAVER. Thank you Dr. Jane.  "
205,38128,1.0,"Let me make it clear that I am rating Dr. John Jane Sr. I have been familiar with him for many years. He use to be kind, caring and well educated. I am sure he is still educated, but the kind and caring is part is history. There seems to be no communication in this office and if you try to speak to him about it he denies it. He would tell me one thing then write my physician and tell her something totally different. She started making copies of these letters and giving them to me because she felt I was being discriminated against. In 2010 I tried to make a follow up appointment and was denied. MEG said she could not believe I wanted surgery. I told her that I never wanted it but my condition was getting worse and I needed a re-evaluation. Again she refused. I was also told by another staff member that I must be doing my therapy incorrect. When I told Dr. Jane this he denied it. His last letter said he was going to call me but it has been weeks and no call. What happend to integrity... "
206,38128,1.0,He has good bedside manners and cares for his patients.  He is very knowledgable.  
207,38128,1.0,"I have a wonderful miracle named Junior Wimer!!!! Dr. John Jane, Jr is an AWESOME Doc!! He saved my husband on many occassions with surgeries that surely would have ended his life! He never gave us false hope when we had very little and he was always giving us the truth, and not just saying what we wanted or needed to hear...My husband spent many months at UVA and soon we grew to love all the care that Dr. Jane was giving to Junior..He's truely given my family a miracle on many occassions and w/o his wonderful hands and knowledge I would not be able to see my best friend and husband everyday!! We continue to use his services and will continue to do so in the future!! Anytime we have a problem, Dr. Jane or Sara RObers always gives me a call back with a few minutes of my call..I know that Dr. Jane will never know how much he does, but we are forever greatful that we met him in the ER at UVA on an unforgetable Monday morning many years ago!!! THANK YOU DR. JANE FOR MY MIRACLE!!! "
208,38128,1.0,WAS REFERRED TO DR. JANE WAITED ALMOST 2 HRS TO SEE HIM FOR HIM TO COME IN A TALK TO ME FOR ABOUT 3 MINS. NEVER ONCE LOOKED AT MY MRI AND MRA OR MY REPORT JUST TO TELL ME THAT HE WAS PASSING ME OFF TO ANOTHER DOCTOR FOR A PROCEDURE THAT MAY OR MAY NOT WORK. HES ANSWER TO ME WHEN I ASKED WHAT IF THIS DON'T WORK - WE WILL JUST TRY ANOTHER... VERY BAD BEDSIDE MANOR AND WON'T EVEN EXPLAIN THE PROCEDURE THAT HE WAS REFERRING ME TO THE OTHER DOCTOR FOR.  
209,38128,1.0,"I've had a brain tumor since I was 3rd grade. I've had more then ten doctors and Dr. Jane has been the best. He has treated me like a human being and has had more answers then any of the others. I've been with him for the past 4 years or so. Because of him I don't see double, I no longer have migraines every day, and I know why I have such bad problems with learning. He has never done a surgery on me... he sent me to specialist and I didn't need a surgery. At least not if it keeps not growing.  "
210,38128,1.0,"I took in my elderly mother to be seen about a congenital problem that had suddenly beomce symptomatic and she was in excruciating pain as a result. After researching the condition thoroughly myself and reading medically published papers and MRIs in hand, we went to see him. WE waited over 2-3 hours and we had driven long distance to come see him. Ihad already told his nurse and office staff that my mother has trouble sitting for long periods of time from the pain. After all that we were the last to be seen and it was already 4:30pm. He finally sees her for 15 minutes at teh max and orders surgery and that his nurse will call me in aweek with a date. Well 3.5 weeks went by and no call. SO I call, and was told that he is busy with several brain tumors and she will call back with a date. Another 3 weeks go by and my mother is begging me to do something. I call and complained, they give me a date 4 weeks later! We went to Dr. Ward in Richmond MCV, best dr.  ever and he saw us right away! "
211,38128,1.0,"I was so excited to go to UVA, as I expected good quality care from a Medical Center School. And so tired of being in pain! Dr John Jane never touched me for my first visit! With MRI in hand, that Showed Multiple Buldged and Herniated Disc's, L5-s1, canal stenosis, Spondelosis  and offered PT and Pain Management.  I questioned him as I had a copy of my MRI and had done alot of research on my conditions, and wanted him to know that I really needed a proactive approach at 46 mother 6 year old and very active, was surgery going to be inevitable.He gruffly ordered 2 test's Mylegram/CT Scan. I waited patiently for a week and no call. So I sent an email of disastisfaction. I received a message to go to PT and Pain Management.  I requested all my test results and Dr notes. He sent letter to my Primary Dr.  after 1st apt, &quot;examination shows she is obese! and nothing else,&quot; (5'10, size 12 shoe, big bones 220lbs) 2nd letter to Dr says &quot;mild to moderate changes&quot; Lets Just say, GET YOUR RECORDS "
212,38128,1.0, 
213,38128,1.0,"Dr. Jane did not admit problems with surgery until made to do so. He did not explain important results of surgery to the pituitary gland and denied side effects that followed. He should have been more forth coming with conditions that will occur after the pituitary gland is injured enough to become non-functional. This information would not have changed the end result but would have certainly made visits to the emergency room later more understandable. Before an operation, MAKE him and Dr. Vance explan what happens when the gland shuts down after being nicked during surgery and what the term &quot;adrenal insufficiency&quot; means to your life and how it can be fatal. A surgeon should be TRUTHFUL. He and Dr. Vance definitely denied facts to us and then changed to say they are doing things different later. Check with an outside endrocronoligist to make sure you ask all the right questions prior to surgery. Compare answers.  "
214,38128,1.0,"I can not begin to praise Dr. Jane enough. He has done wonders for our daughter since she was just a few hours old. He is polite, punctual, and his nurse practitioner, Sarah, is wonderful with children. Dr. Jane takes the time to explain everything.  Again, we can't praise him enough!! "
215,38129,1.0,"Dr Javier is a blessing. It hard to believe there can be a doctor who is as kind caring and through as I found him to be.  Most importantly, he is a great listener.  I'm not sure I would back to myself if it were not for him being so through and finding one of my problems.  My previous Dr. I had for years could have easily discovered this issue through the correct blood work yet never did and therefore I suffered unnecessarily. I'm so thankful to have found Dr Javier and that was originally at an urgent care.  I absolutely love this Dr. and wish they all could be as caring as him.  "
216,38130,1.0,"He does not run his practice, his practice is run by medical school students, staff is very unhelpful and arrogant. "
217,38131,0.0,"Dr. John was rude and disrespectful. She does not even acknowledge a patient walking in the room, rolls her eyes as you describe your symptoms, and offers no helpful advice. She also orders unnecessary tests. Worthless doctor.  "
218,38131,0.0,"Dr. John took her time to take a detailed history, performed a very thorough exam and so far I have responded very well to treatment she recommended.  The office staff were polite and very helpful.  Overall I had a great experience.  "
219,38131,0.0,"Would not recommend to anyone.  I came in and within 10 minutes she had an initial diagnosis which she stuck by despite all indications to the contrary.  Had an MRI months later which the Radiologist confirmed as normal, Dr John stuck by initial diagnosis and wanted to proceed as if MRI had shown what she expected to find.  Not useful at all and visibly gets upset if you have questions or do not instantly agree with her.  "
220,38132,0.0,"I rarely go to the doctor because I feel that most of them would rather medicate you than treat you. When I went to Dr. Johnson, I found a wonderful doctor who is open to alternative medicine and healing and wont just medicate you to get you out of her office. I have been back to her three times, the third today, and she remembered details such as the fact that I have an elderly dog, and about my family, and allows ME to be a part of the treatment and decisions regarding my own treatment. With Dr. Johnson I am a PERSON and not just a case # and I, for one, appreciate that fact. I recommend Dr. Johnson to everyone I know, and now I am recommending her to you.  "
221,38133,0.0,Dr. Jain is very personable and helpful.  Her examinations are thorough and not rushed.  Definitely recommend her! 
222,38133,0.0,Dr. Jain is a great doctor. She really cares about kids and works with parents for the best solution to any issues. I would recommend her in a heartbeat.  
223,38134,1.0, 
224,38134,1.0,"I have never had a problem with Dr. Joiner, or his staff!  I do wait a LONG time.  In my opinion, they are worth the wait.  He and his PA have treated me for about 5 years, for lower back pain and other issues.  The PA is the best I've ever been to.  She listens to me, and never rushes me!  I don't understand why all the bad reviews.  Guess people who have bad experiences do speak out more.  If you are in real pain and want help, they are there for you!  Without their help, I don't know where I'd be right now!  In a wheelchair, I guess. Go in with a good book, and do expect a LONG wait! "
225,38134,1.0,. was in a room for 3 hours and never seen by the dactor 
226,38134,1.0,"He call me a liar about my pain one time.I dont think he is a very good doctor,I ask him to send me to a Back injury doctor and he told me that he have to know the doctor before he send me to.I really dont care for dr.Joiner.  "
227,38134,1.0,"Regarding Dr. Joiner: I ceased to be his patient after he attempted to extort several thousand dollars in a &quot;co-pay&quot; for a procedure my insurance company stated in writing was covered in full, per the terms of his contract with them.  Upon the insurance company supplying that information, Dr. Joiner made an abusive phone call to my home, using profanity and implying that he would &quot;blacklist&quot; me and prevent me from seeing any other pain doctors in the area if I refused the &quot;co-pay.&quot;  I have since filed a complaint with the Dept. of Health Professions regarding these and several other issues. Regarding Office Staff: the phone system is set to ring to answering machines only.  The office staff never returned a phone call to me in less than 4 business days, usually longer.  On one occasion, it took 9 business days for his staff to return a call for a routine medication refill.  "
228,38135,1.0,"paid $10,000 for lumineers, and told after work was done the teeth would fall out and would need additional $10,000 to fix that. Avoid this &quot;so-called&quot; Christian. Hopefully he will pay in this life instead of the next. "
229,38135,1.0,dr. johnson did two root canels on my teeth. i complained about them hurting the weeks after he did them. i complained to him for a whole year about pain and teeth out of alignment. He refused to fix the problems with my root canals and crowns that he messed up. a year later i'm now paying another dentist an endodontist to fix what greg messed up. please avoid this dentist. 
230,38135,1.0,"Dr. Johnson did not accept insurance up front, late filing. He also Oversold&quot; me on some front teeth dental work by adding some substance. The front teeth chipped almost immediately -- very poor quality in a very bad location. I have moved on to a more reputable dentist.  "
231,38135,1.0,This dentist is a rip off. They overcharge for services and and not very good with pain management. I would not recommend this dentist. 
232,38136,1.0,"Dr. Jacobson performed a total knee replacement on me at Virginia Beach General.  The surgery went very well but when I was returned to my room, I was left unattended by my nurse.  I fell and sustained a double compound fracture of my femur.  Dr. Jacobson quickly assessed the damage and repaired my femur saving my leg.  I would not hesitate to recommend Dr. Jacobson for any orthopedic surgery required and I would choose him in the future if I need such surgery.  He saved my leg for which I will be forever thankful.

234,38137,1.0,"Good and friendly enviorment. loves the decoration.  Dentist: very professional. He is such a sweet person and his exams are very educational.  Good place to go, not only they take care of your dental needs, the dentist was very good about educating you about your dental needs. All the charges are discussed with you up front, so there are no suprises. No body is a big fan of dental work, but these people made me change my mind.The dentist is great with kids "
235,38137,1.0,My daughter was in a hurry to see a dentist and everyone was booked. This doctor was available in a few weeks so we took the appointment. He does not seem to have the necessary people skills to come off as &quot;friendly&quot;. I felt that he was not that interested in us as patients and his exan was cursory at best. He never got nearer than four feet from my daughter and we were in and out of the exam room in less than five minutes.  Maybe this doctor is just tired of his profession and could benefit from retirement. 
236,38137,1.0,"He was very professional, knowledgable and courteous. "
237,38138,2.0, 
238,38139,0.0,"I have been to this doctor five times and five times the doctor was late. Twice I was in the examining room and after forty five minutes or more of waiting, I was told the doctor had to leave to deliver a baby. One of the times in the waiting room I waited approximately thirty minutes and the nurse stepped in, told me to undress from the waist down, waiting another fifteen minutes or more. I was told the doctor has left to deliver a baby at the hospital. Needless to say I found another doctor to attend me. In addition the doctor could not find a reason why I should have a Pap Smear twice a year. I have had a Pap Smear twice a year for a while prior to me moving back here to VA. I told this doctor I have HPV is the reason, she seemed to shrug the reason off saying many women had the disease. I was concerned with me since I had previously had Polyps so I needed the twice a year.  "
239,38140,0.0,I have had a bridge done at dr. Java`s office. I have since moved and had to find another dental office and my new dentist has notied how well my bridge was done. Thank you Dr. Java and staff. 
240,38140,0.0,"Dr. Java's staff are completely incompetent. They offered me a same day appointment. When I arrived, after leaving work early, they had forgotten about the appointment. No one offered an apology or another time that was convenient for me. I gave them a second chance and took my daughter. She needed a root canal. Two visits later, and a demand for a $400 deposit upfront despite insurance, they determined they did not have the equipment and she needed to go to a periodontist.They &quot;offered&quot; 30% of my deposit back. For what&#63;&#63; Nothing was done. I would never go back to this office ever again! "
241,38140,0.0,"Dr. Java is one of the most knowledgeable dentists I've seen. Great work. I've seen other dentists in an emergency, and they commented on the great work. The staff there is great, helpful, friendly. I have recommended him to friends who also still go there. Usually able to squeeze me in for an emergency, which i've had plenty. They do not take alot of insurance plans, but I don't have dental insurance. I would highly recommend this office. "
242,38140,0.0,"Horrible, horrible, horrible.  Do not trust with your teeth ... I don't want to go to a dentist any more and I never had problems before.  "
243,38141,0.0,I'm a longtime patience and can't imagine going to another doctor.  
244,38141,0.0,"I was billed by a doctor I never saw, and, when I complained, I received a belligerent letter from the billing office dismissing me as a patient. Dr. Jenkins never remembered anything about me, and my prescriptions were often misdosed. I went to her three times about a circular rash on my arm before she told me it was skin cancer. It took two visits for her to completely freeze it off, and I still am not sure it was skin cancer rather than a rash.  "
245,38141,0.0,. Patiently answered all questions & great bedside manner! 
246,38141,0.0,"Not an alarmist, but very thorough. Big on patient education. Spends a lot of time taking history and symptoms.  "
247,38141,0.0,She and her staff are so awful. They don't want to help people and it just amazes me that they are in the medical field.  
248,38142,1.0,After getting insurance info via zocdoc receptionist request credit card to schedule first visit. then office cancelled on line your appointment at will.             never heard of.              stay away 
249,38142,1.0,Very patient and very concerned about your overall health.  Great Doctor! 
250,38142,1.0,"Great, helpful doctor. When my insurance expird and I had to pay cash, I explained my financial situation and he eliminated some of the charges, so I ended up paying only $5 more that I would if I had insurance. Caring and helpful doctor. "
251,38142,1.0,Great Office. Would recommend Dr. Joffee to friends and family! 
252,38143,1.0,"The staff were friendly and professional,  the time I waited to see Dr. Jinkens was reasonable.  The examination was thorough and all my questions where answered. Dr. Jinkens was professional, knowledgeable and very helpful.  I would recommend Dr. Jinkens to anyone looking for a good family physician! "
253,38143,1.0,I had moved into the area and had a hard time finding a good obgyn.  I had seen two other doctors that weren't very good and then I found Dr. Jenkins.  He is very thorough and knowledgeable.   I would highly recommend him! 
254,38143,1.0,"Fantastic doctor, both in medical skill and bedside manner. You don't just believe he cares about YOU, you KNOW he does. Both my husband and I can't say enough good about Dr. Jenkins. "
255,38143,1.0,"Seen him for 15 years. Views patients as humans. Really cares for people. Will spend necessary time with you. This guy is one in a million. Runs a good office, they make sure you don't wait too long. This doctor actually likes what he is doing. I think he is the best. "
256,38144,2.0,Great staff as well!  Education about my condition was great. 
257,38145,0.0,Dr Jenkins has always been very helpful in any way she can and if she cann't she finds you the help you need. She is a very friendly Dr.  and always has a smile!!!!! she also keeps up with her patients!!! 
258,38145,0.0,"I felt bad enough to go to an urgent care center. Dr. Jenkins bedside manner left a lot to be desired. She asked me a series of questions. When she asked me if I smoke, and I answered honestly, (yes), she turned excessively rude, almost to the point of being mean, and, in the end,she referred me to a drugstore for cough medicine. And was charged for the visit! So, if you smoke, don't tell her because if you do she won't be of any help. Granted, I do know the dangers of smoking, but I went to her for medical help, not to be judged. "
259,38146,2.0,Great service. Very caring. Puts you at ease. 
260,38147,0.0,I never had problem with this doctor. Maybe the individual in the last post was taking questions a little to personally. And if she was treated in ethically maybe she should have seemed legal advice. 
261,38147,0.0,"Dr. Jaffe has taken care of members of my family, and myself, for many years.  I find her to be knowledgeable, friendly and courteous.  "
262,38148,1.0,"I was so fortunate that Dr. Jiranek was not only in Virginia, but in my city when I had Avascular Osteonecrosis. The open joint arthrotomy and bone graft he did was one that few physicians had experience with and most patients had to travel out of the US to receive treatment for. Dr. Jiranek's education is extensive and his success rate with joint replacement is phenominal. In addition, he is truly nice, able to talk to his patients in easy to understand terminology, and always smiling. I have recommended him to many friends and family members, and all have been equally satisfied with him.  "
263,38160,1.0," I think Dr. Radin is mis-understood.  I've been seeing him for 5 years now and can see while some may find him a bit cold at first.  I personally like to challenge him and be challenged by his perspective on things.  I think a lot of doctors in this field will simply follow a formulaic approach while he is blunt and attempts to get to the bottom of issues.  It does take a bit of self-confidence to work with him, but once you get past his mannerisms, he can be extremely helpful and will research things and work with you to find solid solutions.  Very knowledgable in his field and someone you can be quite frank with and even directly question his own analysis.  He is not always spot on with his assessments, but is willing to put his ego aside when you challenge him, and quite frankly, bring out the best of what he has to offer.  "
264,38160,1.0," Wow. I called to schedule an appointment as a new patient who just moved to the state. I explained that I found his name through my insurance company, and he informed me I must be wrong because he had never heard of them. Then he said &quot;I don't have time to talk to you anyway&quot; and hung up on me. Incredibly rude. Suppose it's for the best, as I can't exactly see myself opening up to someone so insensitive about my psychological issues. I can only imagine how he must treat his patients.  "
265,38160,1.0," I wasted a lot of my very hard earned money visiting this man. He is probably in my top five of the most rude, insensitive, condescending, arrogant, disrespectful and down right nasty people I have ever encountered. It's a true shame this man is a doctor that is in the business of &quot;helping&quot; people. He didn't help me at all and simply took all of my money. He only accepts cash and is a nightmare when it comes to handling insurance. I ended up paying for 2 visits out of pocket because of his incompetence handling insurance. Many of my paid visits were spent sorting out insurance and payment matters with 5 minutes of talk time left over. On numerous occasions he would even call me names. On the last occasion this occurred I simply got up and walked out in the middle of his sentence. He did nothing for me except waste my time and money. I was nothing but respectful, open, and honest to this man; in search of some help. He couldn't have been any more rude and nasty with me. "
266,38160,1.0," I don't understand the negative reviews...I've seen over 5 different psychiatrists for my (serious, but treatable) mental condition over the years, and he is by far the best.  He can be a bit gruff over the phone, but is friendly and kind in his office.  I believe that he is extremely knowledgeable; also, according to the framed diploma in his office he went to Cornell.  Dr. Radin even discussed my case with other psychiatrists in an attempt to determine my diagnosis (strangely, even after all these years, it's not clear what my exact diagnosis is.)  Finally, this may sound odd, but he has had a way of making me think positively about my strengths.  I feel that his tendency to highlight my good qualities is helpful both in establishing rapport and in improving my self-esteem.  I'm sure that sounds odd, but I think it really is important for any psychiatrist to be kind, positive, and competent.  Dr. Radin has been all of these things.  "
267,38164,1.0, THIS POOR EXCUSE FOR AN DOCTOR DR.RAHMAN WAS MY NEUROLOGIST FOR 5 YEARS AND I WAS IN A VERY BAD CAR ACCIDENT IN 06 WHICH CAUSED MY MS TO GO HAY WIRE AND I WENT IN TO SEE HIM AND HE TOLD ME THAT THE TRAUMA FROM THE ACCIDENT DIDNT CAUSE THE MS TO WORSEN AND I COULD RETURN BACK TO WORK AS A SCHOOL TEACHER. I HAD JUST VISITED HIM MARCH 06 AND I WAS WALKING IN HIS STILL VIBRANT AND WORKING BUT AFTER MY ACCIDENT I WENT IN JULY 06 RIGHT AFTER THE ACCIDENT AND I COULD BARELY STAND UP WITHOUT HELP MY ADVICE TO YOU IS TO STAY AWAY FROM THIS DOCTOR UNLESS YOU HAVE A POCKET FULL OF MONEY BECAUSE THE WAY  ME AND MY NEW SYMPTOMS WERE NEGLECTED IS SOOOOO WRONG. AND HE CALLS HIMSELF A DOCTOR MORE LIKE A **** TO ME I HOPE HE ROTS!!!!!!!!! 
268,38165,0.0," This place is the worst doctors office i have ever been to!  list of reasons why:  1) They only have one, yes ONE, nurse. half the time she is &quot;sick&quot; and isnt there so you have to wait 45 minutes to an hour.  2) they only have one receptionist! she NEVER answers the phone and is rude to top it off.  3) nurse practitioner is incompetent and lies! Went in for a problem I was having and she wrote me a prescription i specifically asked her and made sure I wouldn't have to come in for a new one if this one did not work. she said, and i quote &quot;You will not have to come in again i will just write you a new one and you can pick it up.&quot; I called back and she told me i had to come in anyways! RUDE!  4) I was not even given the option to see the ACTUAL doctor! they told me I had to see the nurse and that was that.    Overall i would not recommend this office to an enemy.. thats how bad they are.  "
269,38165,0.0,  
270,38170,0.0," wish she were still in practice, always wonderful with my family.  "
271,38170,0.0," Great! smart, helpful and caring.  Would have her take care of me any day. "
272,38170,0.0, Horrible. Said my symptoms were in my head. Found out from my next doctor that I had acid reflux and my symptoms subsided as soon as I was treated. When I was her patient I had symptoms for a year which could cause throat cancer untreated.  
273,38170,0.0," Smart, pleasant. Very caring. She took care of my son and I in the ER and was wonderful.  "
274,38170,0.0," She failed to diagnose my glaringly obvious thyroid disease, despite numerous visits and reports of symptoms. I would not trust her to treat my dog.  "
275,38170,0.0," Dr. Rabun was a compassionate, straightforward physician.  I saw her many times when I lived in that area- and always received excellent care and advice.  She and her nurse practitioner always seemed to genuinely care, and they are much missed.  I had some issues with their nurses/nurses in training, but all in all, this is a great practice.  "
276,38170,0.0, Love her and miss her.  She was very good to my entire family.  Listened and worked with me on an alternative vaccination schedule.  Loved that she is tends to be more 'natural' than most docs.   MISS HER! 
277,38170,0.0, I miss Dr. Rabun she was a good listener and understod my health problems.  she was great with my kids.  
278,38170,0.0," she mis-diagnosed the flu, which many people in town had, including university students (majority of her patients) - she said it was allergies - this was January and snow on the ground - also yelled at me because I had breathing trouble and wanted the exam room door open a bit for ventilation - accused me of listening to nurse calling in prescriptions, outside my door! "
279,38170,0.0," Getting shots is a major hassle. FORGOT to give my son a required shot when he had his 5 yr old school checkup. I had to research CDC recommendations on my own, ask for it & then come back to get it during a separate appointment. 2 years in a row, had flu shots in stock, but wouldn't give to my children until I made several calls/emails reminding her of CDC recommendations- these were both seasons where there was no shortage of flu shots & she had them in stock. My child never got a recommended pneumonia shot because Dr. Rabun couldn't get it. Didn't have combined MMRV in stock- my child got 2 shots instead of 1 since she didn't have this in stock. When my kids were temporarily on FAMIS insurance, she initially refused to see them, even after being their doctor for 6 years. When I finally switched doctors, warned me that it would take 15 DAYS to FAX records! She is very wholistic and attentive during appointments though, and has given me some good advice & treatment over the years.  "
280,38170,0.0, I felt like my needs were met with care and compassion. 
281,38174,1.0, A great surgeon who is really proud to serve his military community. My surgery had a perfect outcome.  
282,38177,0.0, Dr. Ragland spends time with here patients.  She cares and it shows.  
283,38177,0.0," Dr. Ragland is a good doctor.  Very professional and knowledgeable.  She always took the time to answer any questions I had.  Regarding some of the other comments on here, yes, her manner may be a bit brusque and no-nonsense, but she's your DOCTOR, not your mommy, people.  So what, she might not hold your hand and cry with you, but she gets the job done, she's smart, and she listens thoroughly.  All hallmarks of a good doctor.  Go to a pediatrician if you want to be babied.  Sheesh.  "
284,38177,0.0," Very helpful and takes the time to get the diagnose correct the first time.  I have been going to Dr. Ragland for a few years and she has been wonderful.  I have never had to go back for a follow up visit on most of my common ailments (cold, flu, poison ivy, etc.) since she got it right the first time.  Excellent Doctor who I recommend to my own family and friends.  "
285,38177,0.0," Dr. Ragland is a wonderful doctor.  She takes the time to listen, and provides excellent diagnosis.  I've been going to her for years, and recommend her to others, who've had great experiences as well.  "
286,38177,0.0," She is the worst doctor I have ever come across and not only her but Lisa her nurse is rude. They don't care about the patients. Janice Ragland does not even take the time to listen to her patients.  She just prescribes meds and then send them on there way, it's like she wants to see as many patients as she can to make more money. I don't recommend her. Save yourself the aggrevation as you would probably come out sicker after you see her. "
287,38177,0.0, I would NOT  recommend this doctor to ANY one. She is rude and gave meds that interacted with meds I was on. Her nurse Lisa is worse than her. We are done with her. Save yourself the aggravation and pick another doc….  
288,38177,0.0," Dr. Ragland has been my primary care doc for years. She spends as much time with me as I need during visits, and fully explores options, causes, treatments, etc. with me. She is exceptional in terms of diagnosis, and presents treatment options that have been 100% effective. Dr. Ragland is communicative, to-the-point and interested. I would (and have) recommend her to anyone.  "
289,38177,0.0, Very moody. The first time I saw her she was great- the second time she was soo rude. I won't see her again. 
290,38177,0.0," Not a good doctor at all. Diagnosed my Lyme disease as a back sprain. Very poor at correct diagnosis, excellent at writing prescriptions and sending you on your way.  How can that many years of education, produce this imcompetence&#63; Purchase a book by Don Colbert or Harrold Buhner and save your health! "
291,38177,0.0," Contemptuous and cruel towards me as a patient.  Dismissive, petulant, uncaring.  She is the only doctor I have ever seen in my entire life that has ever exhibited such disrespect and downright meanness.  Never see this doctor.  "
292,38177,0.0, I found Dr. Ragland to be very professional and very interested in my health and well-being. I will definitely go back to her. I also like the fact that the office's waiting room prohibits cell phone use--that really gets my thumbs up. Take your phone calls outside please! Paid/Co-pay:$10
293,38177,0.0, Great doctor and listens to her patients's concerns. Dr. Ragland is very professional and explains things very well. Been going to her for the last 6 years. Have had no problems. 
294,38177,0.0, Janice seems impatient and annoyed with me from the beginning. I was treated like I was imagining my symptoms and was a waste of her time. I had to repeated a visit to Herndon Family Medicine and she was not there and received far better care from the Nurse Practitioner. 
295,38177,0.0, She is the worst doctor I've ever encountered. Very rude and discusses patients behind their back with nurse practitioner who is just as rude! Would not recommend to anyone and she is very unprofessional! 
296,38177,0.0," We have had office visits with Janice on two occasions. Janice has proved to be the worst doctor we've ever encountered. She's rude, unconcerned, and treats patients as a bother. On my last visit, she had to consult her medical books over an incredibly simple medical issue. My wife and I would never recommend Dr. Ragland to anyone at anytime.  "
297,38177,0.0, She is very good and nice. She is always right. 
298,38180,1.0, I felt i was treated really well and I really liked the doctor. He saved my life and my husbands life. He always called us to make sure we were doing just fine. He always arranged for medications to be sent to us. He  is an overall great absolutely amazing doctor 
299,38194,1.0," I am a law student and have Attention deficit. Dr Rahman asked me a bunch of questions but then told me to confirm the diagnosis with psychological testing, which was not covered by my insurance. When I told him I cant afford it, he thought it over and decided to go ahead and treat me, anyway. He also gave me free samples for a month. Unfortunately that medication did not work so well and I also had some side effects. He changed it to a different medication, next time, which helped a lot. Overall, I found Dr Rahman to be very flexible and he understood my financial situation well. I still have some trouble sleeping, but he asked me to try some Melatonin.  "
300,38194,1.0," It was easy to get a quick appointment with this Doctor.I needed it coming out of hospital. The Doctor suggested simplifying my drug regimen, which I liked. He explained my illness and its treatment well. Overall, very satisfied with my treatment and time spent there.  "
301,38194,1.0,  
302,38194,1.0," While my son was on a TDO at NVMHI in 2003, Dr Rahman called my wife to tell her that he was putting my son in a cab and sending him to either a DC shelter or dumping him at our front door- we could not pick him up.  Even though my son was very suicidal after being put on neurontin, Dr Rahman released him with a full bottle of medication.  Luckily he arrived home alive.  Filed a complaint against him with VA Dept of Mental Health.  He should not be practicing! "
303,38194,1.0," Dr Rahman seemed very knowledgable, covered ground quickly &amp; comprehensively, discussed the type &amp; causes of my mood disorder. He offered several options as a Psychopharmacologist and recommended 1-2 options, besides therapy referral within the office. In 3 weeks, I was feeling better than in the past 2-3 years. He came across as bookish/serious but sincere. He checked his Blackberry during the session for drug information via Epocrates software, he showed me. "
304,38194,1.0," Dr Rahman seemed like a nice man.  He listened carefully to my concerns but only asked a couple of questions.  After I finished talking,  he mentioned drugs.  After my reluctance to taking drugs,  he emphasized psychotherapy.  Overall he was good but no doc-patient relationship was established.  I did not feel much sympathy from him (but I guess that's how doctors are trained )  And the session was over in 20 minutes.  The staff are very friendly and professional.  Overall,  I would go there again (Renaissance center).  "
305,38194,1.0," When I first got to his office, I completed a ton of paperwork, which is to be expected. Whe the doctor saw me, he didn't have any of the paperwork in front of him. He kept looking at his Blackberry, and I had to repeat myself several times because he clearly wasn't paying attention to me. He was very vague, and I felt like he really wasn't listening to me. Even though it was my very first appointment with him, I was out of his office in 10 minutes.  "
306,38202,1.0," The receptionist is not customer oriented, is not aware of what's covered under the plan.  In my case, she insisted that floride treatment was not covered under my plan, I was not 100% sure at the moment, so let her charged to my credit card.  Then I called and verified with my insurance company of the coverage and I called her back, but it is taking forever, until two weeks has passed, nothing has been resolved.  She didn't seem to want to take any action.  Personally, it is not big amount and it is not worth of the effort, but just want to warn people on their unprofessional behaviors. "
307,38202,1.0," I would not recommend this individual in the future.  He did not seem confident in knowledge and then suggested substantial amounts of future work.  Additionally, noticed poor bed side manner and was not treated respectfully.  Went in with an unrealted back injury which I notified him of, and with all the jarring of the chair and everything else, it was further aggrevated.  "
308,38202,1.0," I have been using this doctor for almost 3 years now and couldn't be happier. He is polite and explains everything to you, so you can make an informed decision about the procedure(s) you are about to undergo. The equipment in the office is more than adequate and the staff is very friendly. The rates are not horrible compared to the rest. Overall, I am very satisfied and would recommend Dr. Rafaat to anyone.  "
309,38202,1.0," best dr around!  i don't understand the other comment.  i've searched and searched for a great dentist in my area and he's the best!  very clean, up to date equipment, i never had to wait.  entire office staff very knowledgeable & courteous. "
310,38202,1.0, Worst doctor I have ever encounted. Doesnt even have the knowledge. Very Rude also. Will never go to his office again.  
311,38210,0.0," Dr. Radeva is an excellent dentist. Friendly, does a great job with cavities, and great prices. I would highly recommend her. She has sold her practice unfortunately and won't be local to me anymore.  So, anyone that is local to her now, definately go to her! "
312,38210,0.0," Dr Radeva the best doctor. Even though her office is 30 miles away from my home, I am keep coming back to her, because I wasnt able to find anyone better than her. Even close what she does. She sauch a nice person, best price and her staff is awasome. Kim such a lovely person to speak with. They make feel you soooo special.  I am so happy with her! "
313,38211,1.0,.   
314,38211,1.0,.   
315,38211,1.0, Dr. Rabbitt is very knowledgeable in his field. He listens to your problems and offers the best treatment. He makes you feel comfortable.  
316,38211,1.0," Online scheduling was so easy. They called me back in 5 minutes to confirm the date I wanted and gave me a time. I have been going to Dr. Rabbitt for years. I have all the confidence in the world in him. He has great bed side manner, takes time with you and is very thorough. Just saw him 2/17/2010 for a problem with my right knee, took x-ray,may have to have surgery but will rule in or out about that with an MRI. Gave me a shot of cortisone to give me immediate relief. I can't say enough good things about this doctor. I would recommend to anyone.  "
317,38211,1.0," Dr. Rabbitt and his partners, also have a Northern VA office in Alexandria in the Inova Healthplex Building.  I have gone to him (&#63;)and his associates for 20 years.  I have had confidence and affection for them. Sometimes the waiting time is excessive, but he spends a lot of time with his patients.  I sometimes call ahead to see if his appointments are on schedule or not, and come in a few minutes later.  "
318,38211,1.0," Great service - I was running late and I called to see if I needed to reschedule - they got me in anyways and I did not have to wait very long at all. Dr. Rabbit was VERY knowledgeable & extremely nice.  He determined quickly that he was almost 100% sure what my problem was, but before doing surgery he recommended an MRI (but it was my choice) I highly recommend him if you have a knee injury! "
319,38211,1.0, I want Dr. Rabbit to be my doc for everything.  He has absolutely the best bedside manner.  He always makes me feel so comfortable.  WONDERFUL man and his staff is soooooooo nice and friendly.   STRONGLY recommend! 
320,38212,1.0, Dr. Raine is a great physician. He listens to his patients very well in order to decide on the best treatment for their condition. He also does not get irritated if you ask lots of questions. He is also very thorough. 
321,38213,2.0,  
322,38214,0.0," She listens, she is smart, and she is thorough.  "
323,38217,0.0,.  Dr Raciti is the first professional that has really helped me!  She is very down to earth and extremely easy to talk to! 
324,38217,0.0," Dr Raciti is the best Psychologist I have seen in years of seeing many. She doesn't throw psychobabble at you, she treats you like an individual. You feel cared about by her and I have made more progress with her than I have in many years. She isn't just any ol' psychologist, she understands on a whole different level. If ever at a point of being tired of &quot;trying to find the right therapist for you&quot; just give her a try, she just might be what you are looking for.  :) Good Luck to all! "
325,38222,1.0," This doctor made me feel like an old friend from my first visit. I like this dr. because he does not pretend  to know everything. He will research and find the best possible specialist for your needs, and works with all other doctors with the same respect he offers his patients. the staff here is very polite and helpful..  "
326,38223,0.0, Dr.radkar treated my mom for metastasized breast cancer. And she was absolutely amazing. My mom did not make it but the 18 months she fought for were all because of Dr.Radkar. She was always there even in the middle of the night when we needed her. She gave me her personal cell phone number for emergencies. She kept me well informed with all of our options. There was never a question unanswered. She was there for my mom and my family through the very end. She does an amazing job at what she does. I would recommend her to everyone who needs her help. And her nurse Kate is also amazing! She was very prompt with callbacks and helping me whenever we needed it! I thank god everyday for those 18 months we had with her and Dr. Radkar 
327,38223,0.0," Kind, patient personality, knowledgeable, helpful with answering questions, and interested in patients as individuals. "
328,38224,0.0," Dr Raby is a fantastic chiropractor, and I really like all the staff at Comfort Chiropractic. However, Dr Raby recently left the practice. If I'm ever able to locate where she's going, I'm going to follow her! "
329,38232,1.0, dr. rabhan is awesome.  he's such a nice guy and he's so knowledgeable.   does a great job of explaining what's going on to patients and then fixing it! 
330,38232,1.0," This is the only doctor I have ever been to who ALWAYS took me at the appointment time.  When I asked why he could manage this when so many other docs do not, he simply stated that he viewed his patient's time equally important as his own. He does not overbook and thus has enough time to spend wiht each patient and answer all of their questions.  He is not about mass production (seeing 40 patients in a day) but rather about quality care.  This is a great guy.  His skills and knowledge are equal to the efficient manner in which he runs his office.  "
331,38234,1.0, All of my deliveries have been ceasarians since my first (twins). Dr. Rabhan delivered my 4th &amp; 5th without any difficulty and I have the utmost confidence in his capabilities.  His humor and compassion are obvious! 
332,38234,1.0," I lived in Richmond for several years before becoming pregnant with my first child.  Dr. Rabhan came highly recommend.  Pregnancy &amp; birth experience was great!  I moved ot Chalrottesville once my first child was 1.5.  I still drove back to see Dr. Rabhan for my annual appointments.  About 4 years later I became pregnant with my second child. I had so much confidence in Dr.  Raban and his bed side manners that I kept him as my OB/Gyn through out the entire pregnancy, which was wonderful! "
333,38234,1.0," Went to see this doctor since he had was recommended by Richmond Magazine as one of the better gynos in the area...sorry to say...NOT! They are probably friend ratings to increase his rating. Very abrupt, fast, likes to do quick medical procedures to make a fast buck.  Would go to a less aggressive doctor, preferably female who understands.  "
334,38234,1.0, Dr. Rabhan has always been helpful and knowledgeable.  I have been under his care for over 22 years and feel in very competent and capable hands.  
335,38234,1.0," I can’t say enough good things about Dr. Rabhan. I’ve never felt rushed during my annual exams. He answers all questions and offers great advice. Recently I had a bad mammogram and when the radiologist notified him, he immediately suggested a surgeon for a biopsy and called me at home to see if I had any questions or concerns. It’s a shame more doctors don’t possess his manner - the perfect blend of humor, compassion and professionalism. "
336,38234,1.0," Dr. Rabhan has been my OB/GYN for 20 years.  He was with me through both of my pregnancies and delivered both of my children.  He is an excellent doctor, very compassionate and very clear when explaining.  Most of the females in my family see him and none of us have ever had one complaint about him. I highly recommend Dr. Rabhan.  "
337,38234,1.0," Dr. Rabhan is a wonderful, honest and compassionate OBGYN. I'm so thankful to have him and highly recommend him. "
338,38234,1.0, Dr. Rabhan has been my doctor for several years. I have never had a problem with him and he rates high in all categories. 
339,38238,0.0," I am very upset with the service or lack of service received from Dr. Lisa Rainey.  Over the Christmas holiday, my 4 year-old daughter got a fever, cold symptoms, stomach and headache.  I called the doctor’s after hours service and was told the doctor on call will reach out to me within 30 minutes and to call back if no call was received.  I provided my cell phone # and asked to be called at that number.  No one called, so I called the answering service again and a new request was put in.  I waited over 2 hours with no call.  I rushed my daughter to the emergency room where she was diagnosed with Pneumonia.  They did the same thing with my 15 year-old son and told me to let the cold run its course.  He also ended up very ill.  At this point, I no longer trust my child’s health to Dr. Rainey.  The scheduling team is very good, but pass that, I don’t care for the service, the looks of the facility, or the service they render.  "
340,38238,0.0," I have been seeing Dr. Rainey since my daughter was born she is very nice, not very personable more like her patients are just a number. Most of the times she is late and one time she never showed up. I actually went there today and she was 30 min late. Which is not professional at all, what if people have places to be&#63; Work ect. Thank God I was off today. Her staff is okay... One thing im iffy about is cleanliness when they give shots they dont even wear gloves! They gave my daughter a vaccince like liquid to put in her mouth .. And the lady wasnt wearing gloves she was around her mouth like seriously&#63; Are you guys so poor you cant afford gloves&#63; I mean what is it&#63; Every medical establishment i ever been to always wears gloves no matter what ! Even during a ultrasound a tech did on my daughter at a cardiologist.. Anyways that is the thing i would want them to change. Im looking for a different doc though. Not because of Dr.  Rainey but her facility is very dirty and not clean at all! "
341,38238,0.0, Office staff are incredibly rude and not very knowledgable.  Also the office is run-down and needs renovating big time.  Watch out for the lack of a step at the door.  I &quot;fired&quot; this doctor after I called three times to say daugther was in hospital.  Finally she called back and said she was glad my daughter was getting treated.  Never checked back with us or made any attempt to make sure we were ok.  I don't need a doctor when my children are healthy - I need the doctor when my child is sick.  Dr. Rainey is always late.  Office visits on Mondays and Friday start at 8:30 and I have seen her come in after 9 several times.  She showed up to office on the day I went in for an emergency at 9:30 am.  Happens all the time.  She didn't even know babies often have blue eyes when they are born.  Isn't that common knowledge&#63;  And should a pediatric doctor know that&#63;  She barely looked at a rash of my daughter when she should have suggested going to a dermatologist...list goes on.  
342,38238,0.0, Dr. Rainey and her staff are very professional and helpful. I had a situation going on and Dr. Rainey and her staff helped me efficiently and were prompt in everything they did. They even fixed the issues with my three boys asthma. I like them very much. I am very in tuned into medical issues and I have never once had a problem with this office. Bravo to them!! 
343,38238,0.0," I have 3 children age ranges from 3-9, and we have been going to Dr.Rainey since their birth. Overall Dr. Rainey has always been helpful, knowledgeable, straight forward and to the point. Even over the years when I had emergencies over the weekend she always called back. The staff has always been helpful to my family.  The office could use a make over but I have never experienced it dirty.  I would recommend Dr. Rainey, I have recommended Dr. Rainey and haven't had any negative feedback from the families that have gone to her and are currently still patients.  "
344,38238,0.0," The staff in rude makes me never want to go back.  The doctor is OK, she could be more upbeat being a pediatrician "
345,38238,0.0," My daughter is a patient of Dr. Rainey, and was very ill through a weekend with a fever over 103.6.  We called Dr. Raineys office for her advise on a Saturday evening, NO ONE called back until Monday mid day!!! We rushed our baby to the ER.  I will NOT recommend this office to anyone.  The service is poor, they don't actually see you at your appointment time, and then make you wait at least an hour!! We put our trust in her office and it did not help.  The staff is rude, and they sit in the back and gossip! DO NOT go to this doctor!! Your child will be better off else where..  "
346,38238,0.0," I RESENTLY RELOCATED TO THE VIRGINIA AREA AND I FOUND DR. LISA RAINEY. DR. RAINEY IS VERY PROFESSIONAL, SHE'S HELFUL, KNOWLEDGE, AND PROVIDE EXCELLENT CARE FOR KIDS.MY SON HAD AN ASTHMA SPECIALIST IN THE STATE WE RELOCATED FROM,THANKS TO DR. RAINEY NO SPECALIST WAS NEEDED HERE, SHE HAS HIM ASTHMA MANAGEMENT PLAN  UNDER CONTROL. I WOULD RECOMMEND HER TO ALL PARENTS. HER STAFF AND NURSES ARE ALSO PROFESSIONAL, AND THE WAIT TIME IS VERY SHORT IF YOU MAKE YOUR APPOINTMENT.  "
347,38238,0.0," I recently changed insurance carrier and came to this dr thinking that I would get some great service, all and all the dr is okay at best but just I have to agree with the other person that made a review, she does not try to get to know the child, she doesn't smile at the child or at me either. I am some what happy with the services but I think I may look for another office that's most kid friendly. Her staff could use a overhaul too, they aren't friendly either, they are just there, the office atmoshere is really drab.  :( "
348,38238,0.0," The staff is very unprofessional. They have attitudes, and they don't make appointments when you call snd schedule them. Took my daughter there and they said she had no appointment. Then I took her back, and the doctor was stuck in traffic and was going to be an hour late 15 minutes into our appointment time.The office is very dirty and there is no air conditioning. The bathroom is very dirty. I would not recommend this doctor at all.  "
349,38238,0.0," I agree with the prior comment, the office needs to be painted, very dirty but the staff has always been very nice.  I recently changed doctors because my family moved, I don't think if I moved back in the area I'd take my son back there.  "
350,38240,1.0,"Well the people that he has know the longest are usually the ones he really sticks it to and unfortunatley they have no idea,its very sad.I know this too be very true because i worked for him,he treats his staff very poorly,they work often with no lunch breaks and he expects them to stay sometimes 14 to 16 hours without any lunch. He has fabulous hygenists,but last year he went through 40 employees in that small office that should say something about his business and his ethics,its realy ashame.His ethics are very poor, unfortunatley like many things in the world Greed and money are the root of all evil and he is both !!!! beware if you dare to go their "
351,38240,1.0,"I would like to inform anyone who reads this rating about the quality of Dr. Saunders.  I work for almost 40 dentists across the country and I have direct knowledge of their skill level.  Dr. Saunders is one of the top doctors on this list.  Your appointment time may take you a little longer at his office, but the procedure will be done to the best of his ability.  I know from experience that he will not accept something that is not perfect.  Can this result in a longer wait or an additional appointment&#63;  It may, but I know that his work will be done right.  I would absolutley trust the care of my family with Dr. Saunders. "
352,38240,1.0,"I was shocked at the negative comments on here. I've been going to Dr. Saunders for over 20 years and would not think of going elsewhere!!!  Dr. Saunders and his staff have ALWAYS, ALWAYS been courteous, knowledgeable and helpful.  You will be hard pressed to find a better dentist and staff in Lynchburg.                                                                                      I travel frequently and there's been numerous times that I've called needing his services when I did not have an appointment - 90% of the time they took me in on the same day I called, the other 10% they got me in the next day..      In short Dr. Saunders and his staff are a top notch organization.                                                                                                                      Regards,                                                                                           Dave R.  "
353,38240,1.0,I have known Dr. Saunders for about 30 years and I have never known him to be pompous.  My family and I have been going to Dr. Saunders for over 20 years.  He is a very genuine person and dentist.  Dr. Saunders is a perfectionist and usually takes longer than normal with his patients.  I would strongly recommend him to anyone and have recommended him in the past to numerous people.  
354,38240,1.0,"I accidentally stumbled upon this site while looking up Dr. Saunder's phone number and was shocked by some of the comments.  Dr. Saunders has been our family dentist for over 12 years and we wouldn't use anyone else!  He has always been extremely friendly, kind and knowledgeable.  In addition, whenever one of the five of us has had an emergency, his staff has worked us into their schedule the same day.  My only complaint is that sometimes his staff will cancel a longstanding appointment or call and see if an appointment can be bumped up or down a half hour, an hour, etc., which can be inconvenient because most people work their appointments into their schedules.  "
355,38240,1.0,"I would bet that all negative comments here are from patients who owe money. I worked with Dr. Saunders and he is the most competant and skilled dentist that has ever employed me.  He is so very nice to his patients, gregarious, and amiable unless you are just downright mean and rude to him and usually the people on this blog who are disgruntled are people who want free dentistry and are mad when they have to pay for it. "
356,38240,1.0,"Dr. Saunders is a skilled and gentle dentist.  I was very surprised to see someone describe him as &quot;pompous,&quot; as I have never found him to be anything but kind, caring, and even humble.  "
357,38240,1.0,"Dr. Saunders, thank you so much for the relief, I was finally able to get some rest. I also referred a new patient to you. Thank you so much again, I feel much better, just sore but thats to be expected, good job Dr. Saunders, I dont trust anyone else but you. Have a wonderful day and I will be seeing you soon for a cleaning. Thank you again, the best Dentist in Lynchburg!!!  Thanks, Chris Lavender "
358,38240,1.0,Very very poor customer service. I had a root canal done there at his office. Which I had go to his office three times to attempt to complete the procedure. Now I have a chip on the tooth they work on and  now because of their mistake they have to re-prep the tooth for the crown. I still do not have the crown on the tooth and they billing me for a crown that not even in my mouth.   He refuse to compromise  with me. I will never go back.  
359,38240,1.0,"Dr. Lee Saunders is a pompous dentist who does procedures he has no knowledge of doing. He has left me with a crown that partially fell out in less than 8 months,infected and decayed bone and now I am looking at a new bill, with a orthopedic surgeon and a specialized dentist of about another $9,000. He REFUSES to do anything to make good on his mistakes and is very pompous and unhelpful when we ask him to please make good on his terrible mistake. I feel like a very ugly woman without a front tooth. He should have recommended me to an oral surgeon in the first place, but he insisted that he could do the procedure. I would never recommnend him. He refuses to even give me a partial refund. You can expect to wait, at the very least,for 45 minutes beyond your scheduled appt. time to even be brought to a room. "
360,38241,1.0,"Dr. Sanz was a second opinion after I had been told rather bluntly from another doctor, I would need a hysterectomy.  I did a lot of research before going to him and decided if he said I needed it, he would be the one to perform it.  He had the best credentials of anyone I researched. He offered me different options.  Choosing him was not based on his bed-side manner (which is somewhat lacking) but based on his years of experience and abilities.  As it turned out I'm extremely glad I choose him as most doctors would have cut muscle and he did not (just spread the muscles) which aided in a much speedier recovery and takes a conciderable more amount of skill. He also did not remove anything that was not absolutly nessisary.  Kept the female parts in place.  As with any surgery, please do your research and keep on top of the doctor you choose, but I will tell you, if you have any female issues which require surgery, this is the doctor to choose.  "
361,38242,2.0,Spent very reasonable amount of time with each patient BUT very long wait.  Appointment time means absolutely nothing.  Lasts visit I spent 2 hours just waiting to be seen.  Staff not very friendly.  
362,38243,1.0,"his staff is not friendly or supportive, however, he seems knowledgable and informed. "
363,38244,2.0,"Excellent! Very knowledgeable, and took time to explain everything. I don't impress easily, but I was impressed.  "
364,38246,0.0,"Dr. Sampson is kind and compassionate.Very thorough, but in this,you will find exTremely long wait times.Average at Least an hour behind.At least.But I still find her worth it.She will sit &amp; listen,and make sure you understand everything she says.I've seen lots of doctors,and by far, she is the best.She was recommended to me, and I highly recommend her to everyone I know.Very knowledgeable. "
365,38246,0.0,"This is a rating from a 'former' patient.   Dr. Sampson AND staff are beyond exceptional.  I was sooo sorry that when I moved away from the area that I'd have to leave Dr. Sampson and staff.  She cared for my entire family &lt;my kids from the time they were pre-teen to adults&gt; and even as my sons grew to adulthood they still felt comfortable with seeing a 'female' doctor.  I attribute this to her professionalism and kindess. I also was witness to the caring of her staff's well being.  On several occasions as one staff person then another fell ill and/or retired, Dr. Sampson was quite compassionate, juggling the needs of both parties (patients and staff).  Other than the long waiting time (which I attribute to her taking the proper time for each patient and her likability) this one rates an A+.  "
366,38246,0.0,Dr Sampson is the greatest.  She takes time to talk with you.   I have never had her jump to assumptions and I feel she is looking out for me! 
367,38246,0.0,"I respect Dr. Sampson and her recommendations however the RN's are extremely rude, unhelpful and judgmental.  "
368,38246,0.0,"Being a patient of Dr. Sampson for 14+ yrs I could never seeing myself going elsewhere. She exceeds Professional and Compassinonate.   I am lost of words, there's no other way to put it, she is just simply awsome! "
369,38246,0.0,"This is an old school doctor. She takes all the time in the world to explain, examine and talk to you. She is thorough and most of all kind.  She has helped our entire family, including teenage boys in just about every area you can imagine.  If you are looking for a doctor that truly cares, she is the one! "
370,38246,0.0,"I was very impressed with Dr Sampson.  Not only was she very professional, but she was compassionate, Very caring, She dug deep making sure that I recieved the utmost care, I would and have referred her to my friends, "
371,38246,0.0,"Completely ignores patient concerns, jumps to conclusions based on assumptions, orders test after test without clear idea of what she is looking for, patronizes patients and ignores confidentiality, disreguards the diagnosis from speacialists in an effort to continue her own fishing expidition, incredibly opinionated despite offense that she may cause the patient.... The shortest wait to see the dr. was four 2 1/2 hours (and I am always on time for the appointment).... Her behavior is unprofesional, if you are in need of a doctor that you can count on to listen to your concerns and give helpful feedback you would receive better medicle advice from a potted plant.  "
372,38247,1.0,"The office staff was very unproffesional and rude. While I was waiting they were talking badly about a patient when she left, saying quote &quot;I hate her&quot;. I would never go back here again.  "
373,38247,1.0,Great Dr. He diagnosed an issue that eluded two other doctors. I now have my whole family going to him. Very very smart and willing to listen/not dismiss your thoughts.  
374,38247,1.0,"VERY caring and attentive doctor.  He listens to you and treats each patient as if they were his most important patient.  He is continually studying and improving himself and his knowledge.  He quickly diagnosed an issue I had been seeing Kaiser MDs for 6 years for with no success.  He saved my life.  The office is small, but the service and care is huge.  This is a great doctor.  A down-home doctor with big-city expertise.  I can't say enough good about Dr. Sargent and his staff.  Highly recommended.  "
375,38248,0.0,"I scheduled a physical without knowing anything about Dr Saksena at Heritage Family Practice in Fairfax.  I was pleasantly surprised by her.  She took her time, listened, and answered my questions.  I was worried that there would be a language problem, but she doesn't have an Indian accent (sorry if not PC, but it is important to be able to understand what my doctor is saying).  She will become my new primary physician.  Her nurse, Jeanine, was excellent too. "
376,38249,1.0,"After going through a few doctors, I found Dr. Salib. He's knowledgable and a good communicator. I don't wait for hours when I have an appointment. Refills are done quickly. When I first started going to him (8 years ago), I lived close to the office. I've since moved to a place where it's an inconvenience to get there, but I feel the quality of service he provides is worth it. When I hear people complain about their PCP, I recommend him.  "
377,38249,1.0,"he pretty much prescribes whatever you want....doesnt really check up on his patients...the office as a whole is horrible, they never respond to patient questions or to pharmacy refills...  "
378,38249,1.0,"I can't imagine a better family Dr.. I am 67 and have had a few, he's the best. I just hope he sticks around as long as me.  CR Mathis "
379,38249,1.0,"Dr. Salib is an professional and truly cares about his patiets. He remembers your name and takes his time and listens to what you say and really takes it to heart, by far the best I have ever had.  "
380,38250,1.0,"This is an awesome doctor. He has removed my bunions as well as my mothers. Yes he is straight forward, but if you have bad feet...you have bad feet.  "
381,38250,1.0,.  
382,38250,1.0,"He was rude, belittling and told me I had a bunion, when I found out later it was only arthritis.  Won't go back.  "
383,38250,1.0,"This is the worst doctor I have seen in my 60+ years. Extremely pompous, arrogant, and rude. I truly regret trusting my foot in his hands. He launched into an outrageous, screaming fit when my daughter asked me if I was in pain during the follow-up appt after she saw me grimacing in pain. He said he despises when family members accompany patients and treated us so nastily. Also recommended unnecessary procedures for conditions I do not have. He removed an ingrown toenail which should be a simple procedure, but now my toe is infected and I need to find a new doctor because I refuse to be seen again by him. A greedy, nasty, and unethical doctor who is just out for your money.  Patients beware!!! "
384,38251,1.0,"Dr Saffron was very thorough, patient, laid out future plans A &amp; B.  Great doc.   Thomas P Oak Hill "
385,38251,1.0,Dr. Saffran was very sympathetic and caring doctor.  He was always very gentle when examining me.  He gave clear and concise information while diagnosing.  My daughter accompanied me and he was also very nice to her.  
386,38251,1.0,I have been very happy with Dr. Saffron to date.   He has been on target with the treatment my foot needed to relieve the pain but that has been a temporary fix and now that I need surgery wondered what his surgical success rate was&#63; 
387,38251,1.0,. He was great!  And I feel soo much better now that my neuroma is GONE! 
388,38251,1.0,"I concur with the first patient and thank her for referring me to Dr. Smith. I have severe Hallux Rigidus in my great toe. Dr. Saffran did not offer me any solution except discussing surgery which he thought wouldn't work or fusing the two bones.  Did want me to come and see him once a month for a problem I've been living with for over ten years and upon noting that I had bunions but &quot;let's save that for your next visit&quot;.  When I asked for copies of my x-rays was told they needed three days and HIS Approval...  Went to Dr Smith, he immediately said let's try orthodics, physical therapy, and topical analgesics. Fitted me immediately, picked them up three weeks later. Six weeks later, no exaggeration, I feel like a miracle has happened.  This has 99.5% solved my problem! "
389,38251,1.0,I saw Dr. Saffron for months about horrible plantar fasciitis that I was having. Every time I went in for an appointment I waited over a half hour before being seen (sometimes over an hour). He refused cortosone shots and I had to plead with him to provide me orthodics ($400). He also told me to to do strengthening exercises that I later found out from my physical therapist that they were causing more dammage then good. I never recovered and finally saw another doctor (Dr. Smith in Vienna) who immediately helped me. I had to order new orthodics b/c the ones I had purchased with Dr. Saffron were worthless. 
390,38252,1.0,"I needed gall bladder surgery and found Dr. Sandiford through my insurance company. I was very pleased at his warm nature and the fact that he explained the operation to me in uunderstandable detail, even drawing a diagram. He had excellent bedside manner...I felt I was in good hands, and I totally recommend him for his surgical skill and wonderful demeanor.  "
391,38252,1.0,"I have been Dr. Sandiford's patient for 15 years. When I was diagnosed with breast cancer, he was careful to explain the pros and cons of various treatment options. Warm, gracious bedside manner, easy to talk with.  "

396,38254,1.0,Dr. Salata performed my thyroidectomy and partial para thyroid removal in February 2011.  His diagnoses was accurate and the surgery was a success.  I highly recommend him and his office staff. Very caring and knowledgeable Dr.  
397,38254,1.0,"Dr. Salata performed my thyroidectomy in July 2010.  He and his staff were very knowledgeable and professional.  He was not only a great doctor/surgeon, but he was very courteous and caring.  "
398,38254,1.0,"The doctor's staff was very friendly and helpful. My appointment started on time. Dr. Salata did a very complete examination, explained his findings and my options in detail, and then spent as much time answering my questions as I needed. Very highly recommended.  "
399,38255,1.0,"The staff is A++, friendly, helpful, pleasant, thorough.  They were totally up front with costs and were less expensive than 2 other offices I checked.  They have solved my gum problem when my previous dentist could not.  I am 100% pleased and I am an extrememly picky client.  I recommend this office without hesitation. "
400,38255,1.0,"Extremely expensive and only seemed interested in getting his money. He yelled at his staff during my appointment, I will not return. "
401,38256,2.0,Excellent Doctor will reccommend 100 percent. 
402,38257,1.0,"I took my son to see Dr Salih on Jan 17th 2011. This was 5 days after he got out of Fairfax Detox for drug &amp; alcohol.  He died on Jan 25 2011. He was in a 90 day program from July to Oct. He was in the Dr office for less than 15 min and given 4 prescription one was for 120 Valium. Did the Dr go over what the drugs are for and how they work. If so how long did he talk to my son to get a history, ask him anything other than &quot;What drugs do you want&#63;&quot; &quot;Is that all&#63;&quot; &quot;take a look in here&quot; &quot;anything you want to try&#63;&quot; He was in &amp; out less than 15 min.

I will never go near this Dr Salih...Signed SME "
403,38257,1.0,"My husband went to see Dr Salih about 1 month ago.  He had been having a lot of problems with  major depression, anxiety sleeping disorder and looking for help and guidance.  He wanted to be happy and live a normal life.  He had a lot of issues that were either looked over or not even given the time of day.  My husband was told the appointment would cost 150-200 for an hour visit.  He was in and out in 10-15 mins.  This in no way gave enough time for him to evaluate and treat my husbands conditions at all what so ever as far as I'm concerned.  No Dr. can get a propor background history physical or give the time to diagnose properly to be sure any treatment or advice given would not be harmful.  He only asked my husband what medications he wanted and sent him on his way ..prescribing a few extra he thought would help him sleep.  5 days later, my husband passed away, at the age of 31 perfectly healthy otherwise.  DO NOT SEE THIS DR!  This has happened to another pt. of his 4-5 yrs ago "

405,38257,1.0,"salih, is probably one of the nicest and best shrink you will eve talk to . i have kown him5 years .never had complaint or problem . simply put he will help you to his best ability ..  "
406,38257,1.0,Excelent dr  Has treated me for 12yrs.  I have been stable with his med ical guidance and meds.  
407,38257,1.0,He asked me how much I weighed and which drug I wanted to try. I was out the door in two minutes. Not helpful at all. Doesn't care about the patients.  
408,38257,1.0,. Dr Salih is both helpful and knowledgable and seems very popular among his patients 
409,38257,1.0,"I would speak with him for 5 or 10 minutes, and he would prescribe an Rx for me. He knew nothing about my life or condition. He is a nice guy, but I wish that he would give me a little more time, especially when the insurance company (he NO longer accepts insurance) pays him a decent amount for 5-10 minutes. I just went in there and told him what was wrong with me. No evaluation.  "
410,38257,1.0,"He is old school, abrubt, but always willing to do last minute refills for me on Sundays, or take my calls anytime. He always answers his emergency line, find me another board certified shrink that will do that. As for knowledge, I thought he was questionable, but I just spent some time doing online NIMH research and found that the medication regimen he has me on is just about top of the line, most advanced protocol for my complicated condition. He knows what he is doing. He isn't going to let you cry on his shoulder, you have a therapist for that. Besides, if he let every whiny sap pour out their hearts imagine how late he would be then! Let's keep him rude so we can get in within an hour of our appointment time. Hurray for Dr. Salih! "
411,38257,1.0,He just likes to prescribe medication and that is about it. Not helpful when calling with concerns.  
412,38257,1.0,He does not discuss anything really. Just listen and prescribe.  
413,38258,1.0,.  
414,38258,1.0,"I to was a first time Chiropractor patient. I immediately was put to ease by staff and Doctor. They were determined to explain everything to me, and I must admit I have never felt better in years. I never fell rushed, and they will work with you to accommodate a late arrival for a session if at all possible. Can't say enough great things about this clinic.  "
415,38258,1.0,"I have been a patient of Dr. Jean-Luc Sansfaute since 2007.  As a first time chiropractic patient, I was a bit nervous and timid about how the appointment would go.  From the moment I met him, he put me completely at ease.  Everything was fully explained to me beforehand, and he made sure I was comfortable the entire treatment.  He easily broke any nervousness with a smile or a light joke, which made my visits all the more enjoyable. He always takes time to answer all of my questions thoroughly.  I never felt as if I were &quot;just a number&quot; or that he has to hurry on to the next patient.  He always takes his time with providing my treatment, making sure all of my questions were answered, and that I am receiving the best treatment possible for me. As a client, I highly recommend him for first-time and experienced patients.   I assure you that once you visit him and his clinic, you will have found your chiropractic doctor for life! "
416,38259,1.0,"Dr. Sampson is great. I've always found him extremely approachable, helpful, and knowledgeable.  "
417,38259,1.0,"Doc had a great personal touch but never followed up with report.  The waiting room was packed and it appeared that the staff was overwhelmed.  However, my appointment was on time.  "
418,38259,1.0,"I have seen Dr. Sampson once. He is good-natured and very willing to explain things, and he does so in a very straightforward fashion.   Plus, I just liked him.  "
419,38260,1.0,Dr.  Saldin is so kind and wonderful!! Love him:) 
420,38261,0.0,"I cant say whether or not Dr. Carlson is actually that great of a doctor because I had such difficulty with her receptionist husband, that it made a horrible impression on her. However, she failed to mention until after i found the hard way that when we up the Effexor over a certain dosage, it works as an anti depressant. Since I do not have depression, in turn made me severely depressed. She didn't even realize that until I had this happen.  In my own case, I had increasing anxiety from Effexor. Tried calling MULTIPLE times but her very ignorant and unhelpful receptionist husband would not assist me. I could not take this medicine any longer and my therapist called to try to get me in. He wanted me to wait a week because they were SO busy (even though its been empty the 5 times i have gone). So i got into a primary care dr. When I went in for my last visit for a perscription, Dr. Carlson was less than sympathetic and defended her husband.  Horrible! "
421,38261,0.0,". great doctor! she's a very nice, intelligent woman, easy to talk to, and great at what she does, highly recommend her! "
422,38262,1.0,Dr. Sarraf is a great cosmetic doctor. I had fraxel done on my face and it got rid of my fine lines. I will recommend Dr. Sarraf to all my friends. 
423,38262,1.0,I had a laser lipo performed by Dr. Sarraf and I couldn't be any happier with the result. My stomach looks fabulous. I will return do do more procedures. I also had some botox and fillers done. I look much younger. Thank you Dr. Sarraf. 
424,38262,1.0,"something very quirky in this office.  Laser tech is very nice - easy to deal with. Master Esthetist is new to office -seems kind and gentle.  Dr, S. treats practice like a rug shop in a souk - prices off the top of his head vary patient to patient.  on my several visits, i have noticed him to be out shopping at patient arrival time, taking what look like friends ahead of me, and hearing bargaining on cost.  very weird.  made me feel perhaps I paid double because I'm American.  And the receptionist asked for a tip! "
425,38263,2.0,"Excellent Doctor, excellent care.  "
426,38264,0.0,Dr. Salartash is an amazing dentist. She takes the time and really listens to her patients. Have gone to her many times and have always been satisfied. 
427,38264,0.0,Sheri is a very cool person. She explains everything and is gentle on the teeth. Highly recommended.  
428,38264,0.0,"I have a very small mouth with lots of problems, Dr.Salartash listened to all my concerns and gave me a through explanation of what is needed, she is very gentle and my appointment went very smooth. I highly recommend her if you are new to the area and need a dentist. "
429,38264,0.0,I was extremely happy with my treatment @ Dr. Salartash's office. She is very Gentle &amp; patient with me. I'm a very difficult patient but she makes everything easy. I feel very relaxed &amp; comfortable throughout the visit. I highly recommend Dr. Shahrzad Salartash to anyone who needs a good &amp; caring dentist. 
430,38264,0.0,Dr. Salartash is one of the best dentists I've been to. She has a magical hand and technique. I feel more confident with mu smile every time I visit her. 
431,38265,0.0,"We had shopped around for a while before we chose Dr. Saba, she was very helpful from the very beginning. Her price was fair with all the other orthodontists perhaps even less, however it was her genuine care for my son's health that was appealing the most to me. Her staff comforted my son when they were doing the exams which showed me that I could trust them. Dr. Saba was very sweet, after my son started braces, I brought in my daughter as well. Dr. Saba'a schedule was very flexible which I loved as a working mother. I'd highly recommend Dr. Saba.  "
432,38265,0.0,I got a few other opinions after seeing her for an initial consult.  She was the only that wanted to put braces on me regardless of the reasons why I should not get braces.  Looks like she is very money-hungry. 
433,38265,0.0,the worst dentist ever.. she lies every step of the way.. n charges alot more than any other lingual dentist. Don't trust her.. 
434,38265,0.0,"Dr. Saba and her staff are wonderful. Dr. Dr. Saba was rated a top doctor in her field for a reason.  She is knowledgeable, professional and caring.  Saba doesn't have an extroverted personality, but she is warm and friendly. Making appointments was never an issue.  My teeth look fabulous now. My only once concern was that her billing staff messed up on my billing.  If you have a very common last name, make sure your payments are credited to the right person.  A couple of my payments were credited to someone else with the same exact last name.  There was a failure to look at the first name.  That's my only complaint.  Otherwise, I would highly recommend Dr. Saba. "
435,38265,0.0,"Dr. Saba and her staff are absolutely the best in NoVA.  My son was very nervous when we first got to her office, but was immediately put at ease by the fun music, friendly staff and Dr Saba sitting at his level and explaining everything to him. I really appreciated this and was very pleased with the fees as well.  "
436,38266,1.0,"I waited a little while, but no more than my primary care doctor. He knew exactly what was wrong before he sat down.  Pt first, my primary care and an ER doctor had no clue! "
437,38266,1.0,I visited Dr. Sangiray for a concern that I had about a rash.  I left the office increidibly frustrated and even more worried than I had been when I first arrived.  He was very dismissive and gave me no to time ask questions. I would not recommend this doctor to anyone. 
438,38266,1.0,I left the dermatologist's office feeling more confused than when I went in.  The doctor talked more to the nurse than to me and used medical terms that I did not understand.  What I did understand is that he used a lot of 'maybe's' and 'could be's' 'looks like'.  He never definitively said what was going on and prescribed a cream and antibiotics even though he did not seem to be clear on what he was prescribing them for - at least he never explained to me.  He did not really give me a chance to speak and did not seem to listen when I was able to get a word in.  He hurried out of the exam room before I could really speak with him and never explained anything.  I never filled the prescriptions because when I called back to the office to find out exactly what they'd been prescribed for no one could tell me and I don't take antibiotics without good reason.  I ended up using tea tree oil and that worked just fine.  Overall I was VERY disappointed with my experience.  
439,38267,1.0,"Dr. Salbert is an AWESOME Doctor!  I had a medical issue and he was recommended to me.  His staff scheduled me in immediately at the end of his day (even though I was a new patient).  He re-scheduled in order to ensure that he could see me that same day.  He has a great rapport and is kind, funny and empathetic.  Dr.  Salbert is the kind of doctor that I have always wished to have - I cannot say enough good things about him and his staff! "
440,38267,1.0,"My 1st visit I had to wait over an hour past my scheduled appt time to see the Doctor. Dr. Salbert is very pompous and addresses your concerns in an arrogant, belittling manner. After 2 visits he could not diagnose what was wrong with my back, dismissed all of my suggestions of what the issue could have been, was very pushy in ending our interaction, but STILL insisted on seeing me weekly, although I was not given any information about the prescribed treatment plan.I asked him if he had an athletic back brace that I could use for exercise.He said sure and made it seem as if he would lend it to me until our next visit. When I went to pay my bill, the staff billed me for an additional $65. I saw a comparable back brace at Wal-Mart for $23...I called back later that day to voice my dissatisfaction and the Office Manager was not in the slightest bit helpful, sympathetic to my concerns or willing to resolve my issue. She flat out said &quot;We cant help you, I suggest you find another Dr&quot;.Awful.  "
441,38267,1.0,I can say enough good things about Dr.Salbert and his staff. They are very helpfull and really care about you. My entire family goes to him and I can't imagine going to a different doctor! He's very thorough and makes sure that he educates his patients on their healthcare conditions and medications.  
442,38267,1.0,"I love Dr. Salbert. I've been to a lot of loser doctors and Dr. Salbert is like the shining star. He takes the proper time and most importantly, HE LISTENS!! He goes the extra mile and he genuinely cares about you as an individual. When you call, a person actually answers the phone.  "
443,38267,1.0,"I have been going to Paul since his practice opened more than 20 years ago.  The experience is more like visting an old friend than going to the doctor. Although generally quite healthy, I have several rugby related problems with my spine.  I suffered for a decade, but Paul's Chiropractic manipulations normally leave me pain free for a year or more.  Pain recurs only when I used poor posture while lifting weights (i.e., self inflicted). Agree with previous comments about his great sense of humor.  His staff is also quite friendly and helpful.  "
444,38267,1.0,"Saved my life @20 years ago... still alive, very happy and healthy :) "
445,38267,1.0,"I have been going to Dr. Salbert, along with my whole family, for 15 years. He is extremely personable, calm, funny, and helpful. He LISTENS to the patient, and treats the spirit as well as the body. In other words, he understands that what is going on in our lives can impact our physical condition. I now travel 3 hours to see him, because I can't find anyone I trust like I do him. His staff is so nice.... but I do miss Ruth!! "
446,38267,1.0,"Have been seeing Dr Salbert for 7 or 8 yrs. Cannot say enough good things about him &amp; his staff. He keeps me moving no matter what I've done to punish my back (ice skater - lots of jumps &amp; spins). Have referred many others who are also very pleased with the care given. Yes, he takes time to do it right, meaning your appt. may run a bit late.  It's always well-worth the wait! "
447,38267,1.0,"Excellent doctor. I was referred to him by a friend whose family has been under his care for over 10 years. As I recently go married, I referred my husband to him. Even though Dr. Salbert does not work with his insurance (Cigna) we are willing to pay out of pocket to go see him. He definitely address the patient rather than the symptoms and his diagnosis are always right on. "
448,38267,1.0,Very personable with great manners. Listens and even has a good sence of humor.  
449,38267,1.0,"Dr. Salbert is very knowledgable and has a winning personality as well. He knows what he's talking about and, at the same time, makes the patient feel at ease. While he occasionally runs behind, he is apologetic and I didn't have a bad experience with him. The staff is very friendly and helpful as well. The only reason I left was because of a change in jobs.  "
450,38267,1.0,"Dr. Salbert really addresses the whole patient rather than the acute symptom the patient experiences.  His approach to medicine is educated, experienced, patient-oriented and effective.  He does what he can to help with medications, he deals tirelessly with insurance and will advocate for the patient whenever necessary.  Dr. Salbert is truly at the top of his class - he collaborates with the patient to form a treatment plan that is financially, medically, and ethically sound.  Cannot say enough wonderful things about this doctor and his private practice.  Our family will continue to see this doctor until he retires.  "
451,38267,1.0,"Much more respectful than your average doctor.  Worked WITH me rather than dictated TO me.  I feel fabulous, and this may be the only doctor's office I've ever been to whose office staff is as helpful and pleasant as the doctor. "
452,38267,1.0,"I'be been seeing Dr. Salbert for 20 years.  Many things make him a special doc, including great listening skills and a firm belief that the patient is the expert on her body and health.  He encourages you to be an active participants in your health care and never fails to listen to your thoughts or questions, or just offer a word of encouragement when life gets tough.  "
453,38267,1.0,"Fantastic experience with this office and this PCP - compassionate and knowledgeable only begin to describe this doctor's rapport with his patients.  The staff are kind and helpful from the receptionist to the nurses.  I often have to wait a while and usually get seen by the doctor about 30-40 minutes after my appointment time - but I understand since he spends so much time making thorough assessments of each patient - once I'm in the room with him, he will usually spend 20 minutes to an hour with me, discussing my symptoms and possible treatment.  He also respects the patient's opinion and will work with the patient to develop a treatment plan that the patient feels comfortable following.  "
454,38267,1.0,"Great, friendly, knowledgeable...and that's just his staff! This doctor listens and he cares, I highly recommend him.  "
455,38267,1.0,Very friendly front desk. Dr. Salbert is very easy to talk to. Highly recommend. 
456,38267,1.0,"We travel an hour, from Maryland, just to see this guy, he's the best! "
457,38267,1.0,"Dr. Salbert is wonderful! Great listener, thorough in investigating descriptions of symptoms, and - above all - compassionate. He is, by far, the best PCP I've ever had. I recommend him to all my friends and neighbors.  "
458,38267,1.0,"very personable doctor. I've been going to him every since I was a little kid. No matter what the ailment he always had answers or direction for me, and made me feel calm through some pretty rough medical issues. He's a great guy and I'd reccomend him and his office to anyone. Good with kids and adults both. "
459,38267,1.0,"Absolutely great doc! Have gone to him for years and trust his opinion. In addition, he truly treats the whole body, not just the ailment. In addition he has a great sense of humor.  Ruth, the office manager, is super! "
460,38268,1.0,Very personable and knowledgeable. Personally recommended to me by another doctor. 
461,38268,1.0,I've been a patient for over 10 years....there is a reason for that. Dr Saadeh listens! He has been patient and caring and offered me a friendly kick to the rump when I yo-yo'd on taking my thryoid meds. I ended up making myself very sick. He gave me a friendly reality check and got me back onto a healthy road. When I paniced the night before my throid ablation - he called me from his home to check on me. He answered every question that I had come up with. His patience gave me peace.  I feel comfortable in recommending friends to see Dr Saadeh - and I've never had anyone come back disappointed ! 
462,38269,1.0,Tried for weeks to get in touch with this doctor to make an initial appointment.  He never returned any of my calls.  
463,38270,0.0,"She is not very knowlegable and came across as money minded. I went for a routine physical exam, she asked that I see her in order for her to release the medical report for my physical. On that visit she hardly spent any time answering any of my questions. She went by the report and started prescribing medicines for any deficiencies I had-- did not really bother to understand if any deficiencies could be related (I later found out they were) and rushed me through the whole visit. I later understood the only reason she wanted to see me instead of handing over the medical report was so that she can charge me for an office visit. If you are just looking for a doctor who can prescribe some medicines she is good, otherwise it is not worth the visit.  I am pretty sure you can find a better primary care physical than her in fairfax "
464,38270,0.0,"Dr. Sachdeva has been my doctor for 3 years now. I like her a lot. She's been great about prescribing needed meds, she's taken off a couple of moles for me (to avoid me having to make a separate appt. with a dermatologist), and I find her to be very caring and knowledgeable. Now I have an issue with a possible brain tumor and she is on top of everything - MRI tests, neurogist referral, etc. I hope she will continue to be my dr for years.  "
465,38270,0.0,"Exceptional Doctor !!! She treats my entire family and we have NEVER been disappointed.  She cares for us like we are her siblings and children.  She's wonderful, caring, devoted and always a pleasure to speak with about health issues.  She explains everything and she listens carefully to her patients.  Coury M. "
466,38270,0.0,"She made me take a test that was unnecessary to make a few extra bucks.  She said I might have heart murmur on a day she happened to have the equipment and technician for this&#63;!&#63;  I'm early 30's and workout, so I'm fairly healthy.  Besides what I paid for the office visit, she got a boat load of money by my insurance company.  I guess I should give her benefit of a doubt and she actually heard something, but I dunno....   I guess I got what I deserved for being so gullible:-/ "
467,38270,0.0,I had to wait for more than 1 hr. She did not pay much attention and was in a hurry. I would not recommend this doctor.  
468,38270,0.0,"I am from India as well very nice and helpful doctor very lucky to have her as my doctor.I found out i was diabetic,High BP and High Chalestrol she helped me with my sleep apnea too always available best doctor and very genuine human being.I recommend her 200%.  "
469,38270,0.0,"Pretty bad - always late, spends as little time as possible, does not take time to answer the questions. "
470,38270,0.0,"Me and My two children goes to see Miss Shabnam. I have found she is very accessible, if kids are sick she just calls us right away, yes this type of call makes us wait a little bit, but even that wait has been never more than 30 minutes. The most important thing I admire is her clinical sense, Unless some thing really required she never sends us to specialist or for an unnecessary Lab work. I am very happy with her.  "
471,38270,0.0,"She's the most efficient doctor I've seen, she's very accessible and she recognizes all her patients. Her staff is a lot better now so the overall experience is positive. Keep it up, Dr.  Sachdeva! "
472,38270,0.0,"I just started seeing Dr. Sachdeva for a general checkup, and she was great. In just 2 office visits, she gave me a full physical, cancer screening, updated shots, conducted a heart echocardiogram, and removed 2 moles and a sebaceous cyst. She's fantastic. Office staff is great too.  "
473,38270,0.0,"Dr. Sachdeva has been the docotor to both of my sons, one 4 and the second one who will turn 2 in September. She treats them like a mother when we go to her, she takes the time to chat with my 4 year old eventhough he does tend to talk a lot.  Every time something has been worng with them and I have taken them to Dr. Sachdeva, after the first dose of her medication they have felt great.  She asks me about my 2 year old and how he communicates and if he can put words together, that is because she cares so deeply about them not because she wants to shock us with some bad news. She is one of the greatest family doctors that I have know in my entire life and I would recommend her to anyone and everyone.  Not too many doctors these days stay in office unitl 9pm every day for their patients and work on Saturday's to provide services.  She is simply the BEST! "
474,38270,0.0,She is our family doctor ever since my daughter was born(My daughter is 5 years old now). She is very knowledgeable and very responsive. She answers her phone any time you need her. I highly recommend this doctor.  
475,38270,0.0,"She always takes her time with you, and does what ever she can to make you more comfortable.  Her practice is also great because she goes out of her way to get to know you.  "
476,38270,0.0,Dr. Sachdeva is extremely caring and dedicate as well as knowledgable. We highly recommend her. She is our family physician who takes care of myself and my wife as well as our 6 month old.  
477,38270,0.0,"I moved to California not too long ago, now I am looking for a PCP just like her, she is the best Doctor I have ever been to. If you ever move to Fairfax area in Virginia, I highly recommend her. "
478,38270,0.0,"Dr.Sachdeva is one of the best doctors I have ever been to, she is very understanding, polite and helpful, very easily available in emergencies. I recommend her to anyone.  "
479,38270,0.0,"Doctor Sachdeva takes the time I need, answers questions well, and discusses concerns. Have had her treat me for a variety of problems, and have been very satisfied with the results.  "
480,38270,0.0,"Lacks even common knowledge about babies/toddlers. Gave us a shock by reading a book and telling that our daughter should be speaking so many words by such a age. Her assurance was if she doesnt start using 2-3 words together she will recommend a speech therapist. For your info, my daughter was only 18 months and as parents we can see she is an awesome child totally perfect. Another instance we went to her. Apparently her solution was can i call an ambulance. Of course she charged us for that wonderful insight too. The last straw, when we went to fetch her medical records due to move out of city, she set a fee for each page to be given to us. God Bless her. But you can find better docs in fairfax. take my word on it.  "
481,38271,0.0,"Dr Santianni is undoubtedly one of the best physicians; not only a superb diagostician, but a good listener and an excellent motivator -- i am hoping she finds the time to reopen her practice. "
482,38272,0.0,I have 6 children and Dr. Sample was by far the best doctor I have ever had. She is very varying and really listens. I highly recommend her you will not be disappointed.  
483,38272,0.0,"I was seen by Doctor Sample throughout my entire second pregnancy, and she was wonderful! Dr. Sample followed my pregnancy very carefully, was laid back and easy to talk to which eased my anxiety about second pregnancy. She listened and remembered things discussed at previous visits, and when I began to have problems at the end of she was quick and decisive about treatment and did not question my concerns. Her recommendations/actions resulted in my son being born healthy and at just the right time. He had IUGR, and Dr. Sample carefully weighed the different factors, monitored me very closely, and made the call the deliver at the perfect time. Dr. Sample has great bedside manner, and is extrememly knowledgable. Not to mention a great surgeon, she did an amazing job with my second c-section, and the followup was great. SO glad I was seen by her and would recommend to anyone.  "
484,38272,0.0,"This woman should not be practicing medicine.  She has a good bedside manner, however she cares more about her paycheck rather than the health and well being of her patient.  She will say anything to put you at ease.  Afterwards when the damage is done, she will lie to protect herself and her fellow doctors.  She is not trustworthy.  If you value your health, stay far away from her office.  "
485,38273,1.0,"Two unbelievably rude staff with terrible thick accent. The office manager raised her voice at me insulted me and eventually hung up the phone on me. I just can’t tell you how unprofessional these people are at this office. Please don’t waste your time and money to see this doctor. The doctor is not even that good.. I was recommended by a friend to see an amazing doctor instead (Dr. Zangeneh) in Sterling, VA. You can Respond to this review if You need me to answer any questions. "
486,38273,1.0,"I have been Dr. Saberinia for about 2 years, and in every aspect he superseded my expectations. His patience, knowledge, care, follow-up, bedside manner, and dedication is what you expect from this profession and he delivers with dedication.  Words may not be sufficient to deliver my gratitude but I feel blessed to have him as my doctor, and I highly recommend him "
487,38273,1.0,"Dr. Saberinia is a terrific doctor.  He's personable, knowledgable, and very helpful at plotting a course of treatment.  His staff however, are the rudest two women I have ever encountered in the medical field.  They are also vindictive.  After a phone call in which they told me they were going to charge me out of pocket, because they were tired of dealing with my insurance company, they sent me a bill for a missed appointment that was not yet missed. They also sent my account to collection and never made me aware of it until I called for a followup appt.   They have been rude on every phone call, cutting me off while I'm talking, telling me that they don't have to discuss my account with me and refusing to allow me to speak with the doctor or even leave him a message. They are unprofessional, rude, and should be removed by Dr. Saberinia before they entirely kill his practice.  I will not to return to see him because of his staff, despite him being a wonderful doctor.  "
488,38273,1.0,"Was not happy with my  privous Endocrinologist so I asked my PCP to recommend a good one to me and he recommended Dr.Saberinia .I am very impressed with his work and knowledge ,and staff were also helpful and friendly...Thanks you.  "
489,38273,1.0,WENT TO SEE DR. SABERINIA FOR THE FIRST TIME A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO AND I WAS IMPRESSED. HE IS VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE. THE STAFF WAS KIND AND HELPFULL.  
490,38273,1.0,"I requested a complete statement of charges several times so I could understand Dr Saberinia's bill of $80, but I never rec'd one. Instead, he sent the bill to a collection agency! The money was never a question -- could not get a complete statement. Dr. Saberinia refused to withdraw the report to the credit agency. Very unprofessional.  "
491,38273,1.0,"Dr. Saberinia was recommended to me by a relative of mine. He has been excellent in providing thorough care for treatment of Graves disease. He spends time listening to my issues and answering my questions, more time than most physicians do. I highly recommend him.  "
492,38273,1.0,"I went to see Dr. Saberinia, and it was a very unpleasant experience. The staff, especially the manager and the fat young lady at the front desk were very rude and did not attend me in a favorable manner. They even charge for a copy of lab results. The doctor is very unorthodox and is incapable of doing his job properly. I would not recommend this office/doctor to ANYONE. Believe me, there are better doctors out there!! "
493,38273,1.0,I am a new patient for this doctor and he was able to fit me in to see me quickly.  This is the first doctor who was able to explain my case to me so that I understood the course of treatment.  He seemed to give all of his patients individualized care by walking them out and giving every second of medical advise.  I really appreciate how much time he spent with me.  The staff was efficient and the office is clean which I am picky about.  Dr. Saberinia is very good - finally an endocrinologist who knows what he is doing.  
494,38273,1.0,"This doctor has the worst staff working for him. They are the most unhelpful and must unpleasent people to communicate with. The office manager is the worst. When you call to resolve a billing questions, she cuts you off and then hangs up the phone on you. The doctor is not any better. If you appointment is at 10:00 am, you can bet you will be waiting upto 2 hours. If you need a refill on your med, it takes him 3 to 4 days to reply to your request or to return your phone call. The doctor knowledge base is Mediocre at best. For those reason, I left him and found a better doctor with a postive customer relation and a great knowledge base.  "
495,38273,1.0,"He does seem to be knowledgable, but he didn't seem to really care all that much.  After the last four minute office call, he pushed me out of his office so fast that I couldn't get an answer to any questions that I had.  I found another endocrinologist. "
496,38273,1.0,"Was diagnosed with Hashimotos and Dr. Massoud will only prescribe Levothyroxine.  It isn't working and I'm gaining weight extremely fast and am fatigued, feel miserable, etc.  The doctor said that obviously I needed to exercise more.  I AM AND I DO!  He said it was too bad but I should be feeling pretty perfect with my numbers.  If he knew about Hashimoto's at all he would know that I need to a heck of a lot more lower on the range than where I am.  He may be good for other things but when it comes to Hashimoto's I don't recommend him at all.  "
497,38273,1.0,"Dr Saberinia Is a wonderful doctor I dont know what 03/25/09 is talking about. you already sound like you would be rude and uptight if you dont mind me saying. He takes his time with his patients and the staff are wonderful... im sure if patients are completely rude to you, you wouldnt be as eager to want to deal with them. I LOVE DR SABERINIA AND HIS STAFF... They are better than most doctors and other staff. Believe me Dr.  Saberinia is worth a lot more than people say on this website "
498,38273,1.0,"I think I must have gone to a different Dr. Saberinia than the rest of these people!  Both this doctor and his staff are quite unpleasant.   This doctor rushed me through the initial consult and wasn't really interested in asking me about my symptoms.  He was quite arrogant and acted as though he knew everything about me when he had just met me.  His bedside manner stinks!  When I showed him lab work that I had brought from another doctor, I thought that he would just have his secretary xerox a copy for their office.  He was so abrupt and unaware that he just snatched up my originals as though I was giving them to him.  After I had left the office, I realized that he had never given me my original copies of the lab work back.  When I came back to the office and asked for my originals back, his staff person was the opposite of helpful and acted annoyed, as though it was my fault!  This doctor is not worth this hassle. "
499,38273,1.0,"I always have a pleasant experience when making visits to Dr. Saberinia's office. His staff is very helpful, polite and understanding. Dr. Saberinia spends time with me explaining my prognosis and my treatment plan(s). I highly recommend him.  "
500,38273,1.0,"The staff in this office were rude, insulting and very belligerent. I never got to see the doctor because I left.  "
501,38273,1.0,"We love Dr. Saberinia. He has been taking care of my husband for 4 years. He diagnosed his cancer and followed his treatment along with getting his diabetes under control. I am in the medical field and have recommended him to colleagues. He is highly thought of in the medical community. However, his staff is something else.  He is worth dealing with them! "
502,38273,1.0,Dr Saberinia seems to be a nice doctor. His staff however are jerks. I have gone to 3 appointments and have had to wait an hour each time. Be prepared to wait.  
503,38273,1.0,Could not find a more thorough and kind physician.  Highly recommended!!! 
504,38273,1.0,"Dr. Saberinia is extremely personable and kind. He explains everything and doesn't rush through his visits, and seems to have a good relationship with all his patients, as far as I've seen. I got lab extensive results with him on my last visit, and was very impressed with the time he took to explain them all. I wish all my doctors were so thorough.  "
505,38273,1.0,Dr. Saberinia is very knowledable and has good advice. He also has a great demeanor. Very good with customers and tends to remember a lot of past patient detail without needin to refer to paper documentation ( a good point). I have found his services to be very good. His administrative staff is a different story...  
506,38273,1.0,Dr. Saberinia is great. He really listens and knows his stuff. I would really recommend him to anyone going through Graves disease or other thyroid issues.  
507,38273,1.0,I was HIGHLY impressed with Dr. Saberinia. He sat down with me for all of the questions I had and didn't put any of them off as silly or strange. I have had a very hard time finding a doctor in this area to listen to me and actually look into my problems as serious and Dr. Saberinia did. I would and have reccomended him to anyone and everyone I know who needs to look into any endocrinology issues.  
508,38274,0.0,Very knowledgeable and is willing to work with you and explore options.  She is also quite responsive and will respond to phone calls usually within a couple of hours. For a one-person operation she covers a lot of ground. 
509,38274,0.0,Great PDoc.  I like her alot.  I just wish she took insurance. 
510,38275,1.0,"Dr. Santulli is very knowledgeable in his area of expertise. I felt he gave me more information than previous Dr's did.He was willing to try an increase in my meds when my previous Dr was happy to let me go on with current meds.  His staff returned my calls within a reasonable time frame.  (within an hour, when I have waited days for other Dr's to return calls) "
511,38276,1.0,Great experience! Great doctor. Great office staff. Surgery went flawlessly...  
512,38276,1.0,Outstanding doctor. Spent a lot of time going over my procedure. The surgery went flawlessly. I recommend him to anyone conidering hernia surgery. The office staff were also excellent.  
513,38276,1.0,Seemed completely disinterested and cam across as very arrogant.  I have no confidence in what he told me and would not go back.  
514,38276,1.0, 
515,38277,1.0,I went to Dr. Sandhu because he was suppose to be a pancreas specialist.  He was very helpful at first and ordered testing.  He prescribed medication to try.  He finally ordered an MRCP which came back negative.  His final statement was that I probably had adhesions from previous surgery and had to make lifestyle changes.  I just felt he was not interested in helping me. 
516,38278,1.0,"Terrible doctor. Expect to wait in the waiting room for an hour and an additional 30 minutes in the exam room for poor service. He has been consistently distracted, aloof, and his bedside manner is unsympathetic.  "
517,38278,1.0,"Terrible doctor, totally oblivious and no bedside manner. Does not prepare you adequate for procedures and unprofessional, incompetent staff that loses paperwork multiple times.  Office is dirty and old.  "
518,38278,1.0,"The man was in the room with me for less than 5 minutes with an actual examination lasting less than 1 minute. I went in, scared peeless, so to speak, and left just as scared and unsure of my health as when I went in. VERY INEFFECTUAL. The next thing I did was found another urologist.  "
519,38278,1.0,"Dr. Salem is nice, but even after a surgery to help with recurrent UTIs the problem persisted.  Today I called with a new UTI and the staff said they would give me a prescription to take to a lab for urinalysis which would take 4 days or more until I could get an antibiotic.  Dr. Salem himself said he wanted to see me if I had more problems.  They basically refused me treatment knowing my history.  I told them to inactivate me as a patient. "
520,38278,1.0,He is a bad doctor.  I received a procedure from him for my prostate to reduce the size.  I screamed in intense pain for over an hour.  Neither him or his assistant would stop or help me.  The total disregard for my feelings or pain level was outrageous.  They would not stop or give me any thing for the pain.  I think the only thing they cared about was the $6200.00 fee for the hour treatment.  I am 6'1&quot; 275 pound man with a high tolerance for pain.  I was just coming out of the hospital for prostatitis and they should have known that the procedure would be very painful for me.  If they didn't everyone in the entire office knew my pain level from my screaming.  The list is long why I would never use this so called doctor again.  
521,38278,1.0,"Dr. Salem was the second urologist I'd seen after repeated UTI's were not being treated effectively by my original dr.  He was extremely knowledgeable and provided me with new options which were more effective for a time, but ultimately my problem persisted and when I contacted his staff for help treating a new UTI they were not helpful, not able to schedule a timely apt to help me or provide me with medication to help me with the pain until I could get in to see him.  "
522,38278,1.0,Very good doctor 
523,38279,1.0,"Dr. Sarma is a kind, patient and caring physician who I first saw because of anemic tendencies, but due to his diligence, early stage lung cancer was found, he says by accident. I think it was more good doctor skills rather than an accident.   The tumor was removed a month ago and no further problems seen, no chemo or radiation needed at this point "
524,38279,1.0,"I saw Dr. Sarma during my pregnancy for anemia and found him to be very kind, patient and knowledgeable.  He listened to what I felt and took it all in.  His treatment plan was specifically tailored to me and it worked.  I highly recommend this doctor.  "
525,38280,0.0,"1. She's not very communicative during a consult and spends as little time as possible with you.      2. Her staff seem friendly at first but then they NEVER call you back.  Even the attending nurse didn't call back to answer a medical question.  Drs are only as good as the customer service the staff provides.  The ones at Physicians for Women are terrible!    3. To go over the results of my pelvic sonograms (fibroids) I was going to have to wait OVER A MONTH to see her. In that time I saw two other doctors and will have the surgery done to remove a 5&quot; fibroid!      Why would you pay good money to be ignored and treated as insignificant when doctors are a dime a dozen&#63; Save yourself the wasted time from work and co-payments.  Go elsewhere.  Dr. Sonia Salgado has gotten bad reviews when she was at other practices as well.      DO NOT GO SEE DR. SONIA SALGADO.  AND IF PHYSICIAN'S FOR WOMEN ALLOW THIS, YOU SHOULD AVOID THE PRACTICE COMPLETELY.  "
526,38280,0.0,"&quot;Dr.&quot; Sonia was simply helpless, mean, unprofessional and mean. She never introduce herself it was just horrible experience.  "
527,38280,0.0,"I waited more than 95 minutes for my first annual GYN exam with Dr Salgado; just as I was about to walk out, she showed up, barely said hello, and immediately asked if I was seeing anyone about bariatric surgery (not that I asked or wanted one!)  She left the room, came back 15 mins later, did the pap and was gone again after giving me a card for the bariatric surgeon, and a referral for an ultrasound to &quot;check my ovaries&quot; (why, I have no idea).  Two hours for less than 10 minutes with the doctor, half of which was her trying to sell me on lapband surgery.  Unbelievable!  Needless to say, I will not be going back to her or that practice.  "
528,38280,0.0,"This was my first appt with this practice after being released from my high risk doctor. I arrived 30 minutes prior to my appt time to fill out paperwork. They &quot;forgot&quot; to put my appt on the calendar so I waited for 2.5 hours to see the dr. I saw her for 10 minutes in which she performed several tests I specifically did not consent to, did not answer any questions, made several incorrect assumptions about my general health, and did not ask for any medical history from me. I asked for a recommendation for a dietitian and she said I didn't need one (after telling me how overweight and out of shape I am). A nurse finally gave me the info. She then sent me to have an NT scan at the hospital, which was a &quot;squeeze in&quot; appt because they forgot to make an actual appt for me. I could go on with the mess that was this appt but the bottom line is that I did not feel like I could trust this doctor with my care and well being and will be looking for another dr. I do not recommend her to anyone.  "
529,38280,0.0,"This was my first time seeing Dr. Salgado, and she spent less than 5 minutes with me. She did the exam, didn't ask if I had any concerns or questions, and flew out the door so fast that I didn't have time to even blurt out a question. And I was a new patient. This is a doctor's office at its worst. I now will be returning to my old doctor (and paying another co-pay) because I have some concerns I have to ask a doctor about that Dr. Salgado didn't give me the chance or time to ask. Horrible.  "
530,38280,0.0,Dr. Salgado is the best! I changed doctors at 36 weeks because my original doctor was very mean. It was a hard decision so late in my pregnancy but Dr. Salgado and her staff were wonderful.  
531,38280,0.0,"Dr. Salgado delivered my baby back in 2004. It was an ok delivery, which I think could have gone better had Dr. Salgado showed up in time for my pushing. However, overall she is ok. Her English is rather limited, so it is difficult to communicate with her sometimes. I would still recommend her, but I am not wowed.  "
532,38280,0.0,"Dr. Salgado is small, but has large skill and care! She referred me to her own doctor for a lump that the referring radiologist said was &quot;most likely beenign&quot;. She said, &quot;If in your gut, you think it may be something suspicious...I would call Dr. Teal.&quot; She then handed me her doctor's card. Dr.  Salgado is wonderful! "
533,38280,0.0,"Dr. Salgado is wonderful! I went to her using the reference below and I couldn't be happier. The staff is very friendly and they are VERY good with same day appointments. Anytime you call them after hours, they respond asap. They have very pleasant and authentic bed-side manners. I'm very glad I chose this doctor to deliver my baby. "
534,38280,0.0,Dr. Salgado is awesome! The entire staff is very welcoming. I refuse to try anyone else. 
535,38281,1.0,I had been feeling bad for years and for two years I had seen many specialists without any improvement. It took only two visits with Dr. Saadat to diagnose my problem. Dr. Saadat is the best diagnostician and I am forever thankful.  
536,38281,1.0,Seyed H Saadat gave me a medication called Factive in his office. Right in front of him in black and white was a list of my allergies. The medication he gave me is in the Quinolone Family of medicines and I am deathly allergic to it. 
537,38282,2.0, 
538,38283,1.0,I have not had any issues with his care or information given.  I have recommended others to him and they were very impressed with him.  
539,38283,1.0,"Although he can be blunt, this is a excellent doctor.  One who is very knowledgable and very skilled in his area of medicine.  I would put my life or that of a loved one in his hands with all confidence. "
540,38283,1.0,This man has no business in health care.  He is extremely rude and arrogant. 
541,38284,0.0,"she is very thought full and nice person. she did all she could and quick, when my wife needed help. thanks doc keep up the good work. "
542,38285,2.0,"I left due to the staff and some of their attitudes. ALso,I had labs signed off on and had found errors on them which leads me to believe that they were not looked at carefully enough to notice these huge errors. I really do not need any rude staff and can take my business elsewhere. I have never been treated so poorly like I have when I was here. Good luck getting your labs and if so you better make sure you copy what is being done.  Thank god I keep good records and document everything! "
543,38286,0.0,"My 79 yr old mother fell and broke her hip and Dr. Satpathy was the weekend Dr. Thank God! We couldn't have asked for a more knowledgeable, caring, kind individual. He acted like he had all the time in the world for my mother. He made sure she understood what was happening and spoke on her level. He was very caring sometimes coming in 2 times a day to see her while in the hospital, even on Sunday! His care far exceeded my expectations for a small community hospital in the middle of nowhere. The procedure he performed was the most advanced for her break my later research confirmed. Her after care is yet to be determined but our initial surgical experience has been exceptional.  "
544,38287,1.0,"I had questions about my not too good bloodwork results but the doctor didn't try to find out with my help (questions) why the results are like that. He just adjusted my medicine and ordered new bloodwork. Also, he was speaking very quietly so I had to ask him to repeat himself to know what he said, and he didn't say much to start with. "
545,38287,1.0,"I was told I would get a needle aspiration for nodules both sides of neck.  Never explained process before I made the appointment,  arrived found out its six needles each side and no numbing for neck.  To add to that fear you sign a form before the procedure that says all those takes may not even be enough or correct.  I was so upset.  You cannot just expect a person to lay there after they see the needles.  You do a huge disservice to your patients when you don't take time to prepare them.  I was so upset I did not want to hear an explanation,  my heart was racing and I was unwilling to go forward.  I will not go back to this doctor.  "
546,38287,1.0,"I have been under Dr. Safa's care for about 10 years and have had no problems with him.  He has always been pleasant to me and seems very knowledgeable.  The only problem I have had with him is that he has asked me to lose 15 lbs before I see him in 6 months.  After attempting to lose the weight, I called to ask if I could get some help or advice on losing it, and was referred to another physician that does not accept insurance.  As an endocrinolist, he should be able to help me himself.  "
547,38287,1.0,"I am very surprised to read some of these negative reviews concerning Dr. Safa.  He was highly rated by the washingtonian magazine which tells you more than this site's ratings. I have seen him for over 6 years for hypothyroism and have found him to be a very good doctor.  I don't understand why some people rate their doctor's personality rather than their ability as a doctor.  His manner is business like, not overly friendly, but he is your doctor, not your friend.  I am impressed by how the office manages the wait-time and sees patients very quickly.  Very rarely is there a wait, and I appreciate that.  My condition is properly managed- no issues whatsoever.  Would recommend to a friend in a heartbeat.  "
548,38287,1.0,Such an amazing doctor...used to be a Professor of Medicine and it shows.  Clearly knows what he is talking about...an Excellent source of knowledge.  
549,38287,1.0,"First, I had to wait for about an hour.  Second, I met with his nurse practitioner who did not have a sympathetic bone in her body.  Third, I met with Dr. Safa, who made the nurse practitioner seem kind.  I'm not sure if they know what they are doing, but it doesn't matter because I am most definitely not doing any follow ups with them.  I decided that about 10 minutes into my appointment, and had it reconfirmed over and over throughout my visit.   STAY AWAY!!!!! "
550,38287,1.0,"Do not go to this doctor.  He diagnosed me with Hashimoto desease and said I may develop hypothyrodism later on.  I asked him how my higher my chances were relative to a 'normal' person.  He said medicine is not a science, so he couldn't give me numbers.  And I thought medicine WAS a science... "
551,38287,1.0,"He is a pathetic Doctor who needs to find another profession.  I was diagnosed with graves disease and suffering miserably and all he could do was tell me that I was depressed.  He was no help at all and did not take the time to explain what I was going to go through after RAI to treat the disease. He just said you take this tiny pill and you are fine.  Yeah, bullcrap! I would not recommend this Doctor to my worst enemy! "
552,38287,1.0,"I went to see Dr. Ali Safa after having problems with losing weight and for having nodules. I speficially selected him because his bio said he specialized in metabolism.  We he obviously does not. While he was through in his exam of the nodules, he could of cared less about the weight issue.  When I asked about what to do about he weight issue, he told me I was depressed.  I said no, I am not depressed and he said, yes you are.  So obviously after getting no real answers I am looking for another Endo.  I would not recommned this doctor.  "
553,38287,1.0,"I am not usure if there is another Dr. Safa, but mycomments are directed to Dr. Ali Safa. I have to say that going to see him was the worst mistake of my life. His office staff is great and so is his nurse practitioner, but Im no paying to see the nurse. I am paying to see the Doctor. I would ask him questions and he would look at me and not respond AT ALL. I would repeat the question and still no response. For anyone who is a Diabetic one thing that your endocronoligist should be checking is your feet which I would have to ask him to do. He would lecture me for gaining weight even though I was carefully monitoring my weight and exercise regime only to find out that the medication HE had put me on induced weight gain. After switching doctors and switching medication I lost 15 pounds in 2 weeks. I strongly urge you to pick another doctor as I feel the care I received was very poor. I think that this man in neglegent and should perhaps be reported to the medical board.  "
554,38287,1.0,I have been seeing Dr. Safa for years and I wouldn't trust my care to any other endo. He is very knowledgeable and will work with me on my treatment plans.  
555,38287,1.0,"Referred to him by primary care as 'one of the best in this area' -- untrue. Did not explain anything to me, did not draw blood on first vist before putting me on 3 medications for hyperthyroidism and did not follow up how the medications were affecting me. Did not return phone calls. I changed doctors after almost 2 months.  "
556,38287,1.0,"Dr. Safa is VERY knowledgeable and helpful. When I lost my job and as a result my health insurance, he gave me free medication and a discount on my blood work. I have always been very impressed with the service offered by Dr.Safa. And I recommend him. "

561,38290,1.0,Dr. Sanders has been my doctor for many years and he has always diagnosed my ailments correctly. He will take the time to talk to you if you have questions. I like him and his staff is very friendly.  
562,38290,1.0,I found him to be unfriendly and in a hurry to get on to the next patient. Not as much knowledge as I thought he would have on thyroid disease.

But there have been no problems with infections afterwards. I don't take any pain medications thanks to his help.

There are risks with every procedure...even a flu shot at your family doc's office. Ask you family doc who he would send you to and see who's names pops up! Dr.  Sam's!! "
573,38297,1.0,"Dr. Samarasinghe injured my husband resulting in a staff infection that went to his heart.  Dr. Sam knew that he had an heart problem and still placed him in a high risk situation. Dr. Sam knew the day he injected him that he had gone to deep and had hit a nerve in his back with a needle.  Dr. Sam ignored my husband's compliants. My husband spent 6 mos. in hospital fighting for his life. He had heart surgry to replace valves that were taken out due to this infection. He will never fully recover, does not have bladder function. Dr. Sams office is phyically nasty. I would not let Dr. Samarsinghe treat a dog on the street.  "
574,38298,0.0,"I have been VERY pleased with Dr. Saba's care over the past years. She is a caring, knowledgeable provider who will go out of her way to see that your needs are met. The office staff is average with room for improvement. "
575,38298,0.0,"I have been seen by Dr. Sabah for almost a year now, the last three weeks has been an absolute mess. To make your questions short and sweet DO NOT GO TO THE FAIRFAX OFFICE the receptionist talks about your medical history and personal medications in front of the whole waiting room. I did try telling the nurse maybe she could talk to the doctors but she said all she could do is leave a message, how useless. I love Dr. Sabah but her receptionist needs to retire. I will make sure I do the whole office a favor when I make my compalint to the proper places.  "
576,38298,0.0,"I love Dr. Saba, I have been seeing her for years.  I was seeing Dr. Nguyen in the practice prior to doctor Saba, but when she joined the practice I began seeing her.  She has a very kind and gentle nature about her.  Dr. Saba has always made time to see me no matter what office she is in.  She has gone above and beyond the call of duty for me when I was very ill, alone and taking care of 2 children when my husband was in Iraq.  I really cannot say enough kind words about this doctor.  If you want to see a doctor who has compassion for her patients and will make every attempt to help you find answers to your medical delimas and help you feel better than you need to make an appointment with doctor Saba.  I think she is great, I would refer my dearest friend or trust her with my child.  "
577,38299,1.0,9/27/201 I would not recommend Dr. Saba. He was very quick to recommend surgery and tried to rush us into scheduling it the next day. We were not 100% confident in him and got a 2nd opinion. The specialist we saw did not recommend surgery. We are so thankful we saw someone else and decided to not have the surgery done. 
578,38299,1.0,"The worst person on earth, this Doctor is a crook a money sucking do not believe a word of what he says. At first he seems nice and compassionate till he gets your business. If you want problems and have nothing to do with your money this doctor is a good way to throw it away. "
579,38300,0.0,Patti who is the office receptionist is so rude and unhelpful.  She talks about patients in the office which they are in the back.  Extremely unprofessional.  And constantly asks you questions that are currently in the file OR that she should know.  Makes going to this office a major choir.  Staff turnover is high.  BUT there are one or two who make it okay.  
580,38301,1.0,"Actually, the most caring Doctor I have ever been to. My wife now goes to him also & loves him.  Would very much recommend.  "
581,38301,1.0,I feel very comfortable with Dr. Salama. I feel like he takes his time to understand my health. I'd be upset if he left Roanoke.  
582,38301,1.0,Dr.Salama has been our family Dr. for 7 years... We've sent a lot of new patients to him... He's a part of our &quot;family&quot; and we trust & love him...

587,38304,0.0,". wrong diagnosis on back; she is not very friendly, has poor bedside manner; spent all of 5 minutes with me on three different visits; licks to impress patients with her dress and demeanor "
588,38304,0.0,The office staff was horrible.  The receptionist urged me to go to the emergency room the first time I called - she's not qualified to diagnose my symptoms and shouldn't have in the first place (emergency room dr. said I didn't need to go).  Dr. Santini was anxious to do surgery on my back and kept suggesting it would help. I wanted to try physical therapy and that relieved most of my symptoms. I followed up with a different orthopedic and he said my condition is mild and doesn't require surgery. Just avoid this office.  
589,38304,0.0,"I will never go there again, or will I recommend anyone I know to his office.  Dr. Santini's diagnosis was incorrect. After, 2 visits, she told me that she could not finish a proceedure and my son needed surgery on his knee. We immediately saw a highly recommended orthopedic for a second opinion. The doctor took a new set of xrays and assured me that there was no dammage to the knee. The knee was swollen due to collection of blood from a sports injury.  He drained the knee on the same visit, (PAINLESSLY). One week later everything is back to normal and my son is cleared to participate .  "
590,38304,0.0,"I felt like she had one hand on the door the whole visit. It was very hard to ask her questions, because she seemed like she was in a hurry. She wanted to do surgery on my back before trying anything else. I actually opted to do nothing and now have no pain. If I had done the surgery, I would still be in the six week recovery. "
591,38304,0.0,I had a dislocated elbow. Both doctor and her staff were to notch. They saw me right away and were very attentive.  
592,38304,0.0,"Shes terrible.  Poor bedside manner, she told me my back pain was the result of genetics and was my parents fault. "
593,38304,0.0,"Dr. Santini did not explain the problems I had with my back to me very well.  I had to see another Dr. to get the whole story.  She was very cold and did not show any compassion, telling me I had to live with chronic pain.  "

596,38305,1.0,"Dr. Salvant does not have a good bedside manner and he is difficult when it comes to personality and being able to converse with you. If you are looking for a friend dont go to him. If you are looking for the best neurosurgeon in richmond, he is the best as rated by his peers.  "
597,38305,1.0,Doesn't have very good bedside manner.  Doesn't take much time with the patient.  
598,38306,0.0,"Spends as much time as required to examine, diagnose, and answer patient questions.  Left &quot;assembly-line&quot; practice at Pratt in order to do so.  "
599,38306,0.0,"Dr Saber has been my primary care doctor for years.  When she and Dr Mussey left Pratt Medical, I was unable to follow them because of my insurance.  I tried four doctors during the time she was in King George and was not happy with any of them.  When she moved back to Fredericksburg, I changed insurance providers so I could go back to her.  She has taken care of all my medical issues and has referred me to the best specialists.  I recommend her to all my friends and they are happy with her as well.  "
600,38306,0.0,Dr. Sarber is always helpful.  She does not give up until she has found the problem or gets you to a specialist that can help.  She doesn't send you to &quot;Any&quot; specialist either.  She wants the best for her patients.  Her staff are excellent.  Very caring.  My husband and I are so lucky to have her as our &quot;family&quot; physician. 
601,38306,0.0,She's great!  She listens to you and tries to address all of your concerns.  
602,38306,0.0,"Dr.Sarber is the closest thing there is to an &quot;old-fashioned&quot; doctor that lovingly treats patients as family. I can confidently say there is NO better doctor ANYWHERE. The same staff have been with her since the beginning and that alone says alot.  They are all the very BEST. I've never gotten anything but prompt, courteous, knowledgable care.  "
603,38306,0.0,"I was referred to Dr. Sarber by my OB/GYN for follow-up on out-of-range thyroid tests. I cannot believe how many other reviewers say she listens. She did not listen to me at all. In fact, she would not even let me finish my sentence and she incorrectly assumed what I was going to say. She dismissed the thyroid issue, which was in fact an issue diagnosed by another doctor a year later. She belittled my concerns and talked down to me. I think she is both a horrible person and a horrible doctor. I don't understand how she could be so good to other patients except that she makes snap judgments and decided she didn't want me for a patient. If so, she succeeded. "
604,38306,0.0,Extremely  friendly staff. short wait time.  Doctor has pleasant manner and does not rush.  
605,38306,0.0,"Dr. Sarber is the most thorough, professional, and accurate doctor I have ever had the pleasure of dealing with. She was able to pinpoint the cause of a difficulty I had battled for over 20 years, sent me to the appropriate specialist, and the treatment literally changed my quality of life. Because she had really LISTENED when I went in (& was her patient for several yrs), she knew me. She said that we would order some tests, and if these didn't find the problem, we would do more and WOULD out what the cause was. She was committed, and she--unlike numerous drs before her--found it. When she left Pratt, her practice did not accept my insurance, so I've had to find another--but she is priceless. Even my mother--an R.N. with master's & partway through her Ph.D, as well as a terrible patient who distrusts most doctors, loved and trusted Lisa Sarber. Wish she'd take Optimum Choice, because I'd be back in a heartbeat. God bless her! "
606,38306,0.0,"I was surprised to read reviews saying Dr. Sarber needed to slow down or they were late. I have gone to Dr. Sarber for over 10 years (stayed with her during her split with Pratt), etc. Once she left the clinic, I NEVER had the long waits I used to and really felt she was very professional.  She gets to the point, listens, and really goes out of the way to accomodate so many changes I have seen in medical coverage! Thanks! "
607,38306,0.0,"May have a slight wait, but she definitely takes the time to check everything out. Great listener! "
608,38306,0.0,I like her more than any doctor I have ever seen. She always listents and considers my suggestions for my treatment. She seems very caring and is pleasant to be around.

614,38308,1.0,Wonderful practice! I am feeling alot better thanks to Dr. Samuels 
615,38308,1.0,"Horrible!!!  Do not see these people! Horrible office environment, staff and really not at all knowledgeable about anything in particular.  "
616,38308,1.0,"i believe this doctor to be irresponsible,  neglectful and dangerous to his patients , as any i have ever encountered. the treatment did not work. "
617,38309,1.0,"Dr. Sabloff is EXCELLENT in his field and extremely knowledgeable. He explains everything well. Because of insurance mandates, I don't know how any doctor can be punctual and still make money. Dr. Sabloff is respectful of my time through his punctuality, but if you have an appointment other than first in the morning, you may have to wait longer than you'd like.  However, he is so good at his job, he's worth the wait!  His staff is professional and businesslike; they are friendly, but not overly friendly.  "
618,38309,1.0,Working with him so far has been very helpful.  
619,38309,1.0,"Dr. Sabloff is an excellent, knowledgeable doctor.  He and his staff have addressed many sports related injuries for me and several of my family and friends.  He recently performed surgery on me to correct a meniscus tear.  He tried everything possible to avoid the surgery (for more than a year) and was successful in helping me return to approximately 90% without surgery and we had agreed that I was comfortable with this level.  However, while watching a tennis event, I went to move around on the bleacher and completely tore the meniscus--which was painful.  Went to the hospital that night and the next day went to see Dr. Sabloff.  Dr. Sabloff had to schedule me for surgery and the surgery went well and I am now close to 95% recovered.  I am back playing sports, working out and feeling better every week.   You may have to wait a little longer to get an appointment with him or once at his office to be seen by him, but when it comes to sports injuries, he's the man! "
620,38309,1.0,"My aunt had surgery with Dr. Sabloff in the early 90's so I had a good recommendation to see him. When I visited the office, I was in the exam room waiting for him and I could overhear him on th ephone telling his stockbroker he could afford any size boat he wanted. During his examinstion of my arm, I felt like he was totally distracted on his boat and didn't even make eye contact with me. "
621,38310,1.0,Dr. Saul is a knowledgable and caring person. I am still living because of his excellent skills as a surgeon. I would recommend him to any one in need of Gynocologic surgery. 
622,38311,0.0,"Run do not walk from Dr. Delgado.  Without a doubt the worst care I have ever received.  She ignored and dismiss everything I, and referring ENT specialist, said.  I felt trapped to stay with the practice because I had started allergy shots and they were making a difference with my symptoms.  And, I had been in agony.  So thankful that now that I am at maintenance dose I have been able to leave the practice and be seen by a competent caring allergist.  First rule of medicine -- listen to your patient.  Dr. Delgado not only refused to listen, she ignored and/or dismissed everything I said.  And, the opinions of two ENT specialists -- one of which she demanded I see.  Horrible, horrible, horrible experience. "
623,38311,0.0,"I visited this doctor just out of curiosity for my food allergies as part of taking care of my energy levels.The assistant was very confused and she entered wrong information about my histroy for the reason Insurance denied coverage.Wait it was not only that she was confused which foods she already used to mark and confused and started using the left ones ,it is almost like waste of my office hours and commute and lot of frustration I have gone through.When I called to office they were very irresponsible esp from the HR department it seems.She was real rude as if I am trying to escape the money to pay.It was worst experience I ever had almost like they catched me as easy fish ..  "
624,38311,0.0,"She works with Dr. Richard Rosenthal who is among the top doctors. She is a very nice lady, they always ask me a lot of questions to make sure I'm alright. The nurses are sweet too. They usually give me free samples of my medication whenever I visit them. "

628,38315,2.0,Great clinic environment and proficient medical practice. 
629,38316,0.0,"Dr. Sadr and her staff are the absolute best.  I have been working through my treatment plan with them for the last year (2011 to now Aug. 2012).  They have done my extractions, fillings, crowns, a temporary denture as we prepare for implants, and implants themselves with a few more to go.  No one is more stunned than me that at this amount of work there have literally been NO stumbles, no painful fitting, everything just flawless.  Professionally they dominate, I really can't imagine anyone more precise or caring than Dr. Sadr (and Dr. Kooshki too!).  Their staff is the same, from the front desk awesomeness to techs.  No overcharging, no changing prices, not even waiting before appts. Everything has flowed and I've had an incredible amount of work done. I obtained estimates from other dentists and am certain I made the right choice.  I went there as a very embarrassed person holding back tears and leave in total admiration.HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend, no way will you be disappointed "
630,38316,0.0,"I think Dr. Sadr and her staff are great!  I have always been treated with kindness and a smile.  She has been my dentist for several years.  She has done checkups, cleanings, and a crown.  I've been very happy with her dental care.  "
631,38316,0.0,"My experience with this Dentist office is really bad. They charged me first and then they don't refund your money quickly. I went to them in good faith and paid most amount upfront, and even after more than 7 months I am working with them to get clear all my refund. Another, part is staff is more rude, they keep on lying that they have kept voice messages when infact they have not left a single message. About doctors experience was, they numbed my tooth and came and said they can't continue until the payment is done in full. I will advice people to avoid this doctor. Its a free advice take it or you can experience them.  "
632,38316,0.0,"The staff seem high pressure and the doctor was forcing me to get more cavities filled than I really had. I went in there after I moved from Alexandria and she said I had about 6 cavities, she'd have to numb me up and fill all of them. I didn't believe her because I'd never had a cavity before so I went to my old dentist in Alexandria and she said I had maybe 3 possible cavities that were very near the surface and may or may not become cavities. She filled them without any novacaine. I don't trust this doctor because she is newer and I hear newer doctors tend to push procedures on you to get more money than more established doctors.  "
633,38317,1.0,"The absolute worst experience with a doctor I have ever had. Left his office shaking and have not slept a full night since my visit 5 days ago. Waited a month for appointment. He is rude, disrespectful.  I feel like I was emotionally and physically assaulted "
634,38317,1.0,"He spent 5 hours in surgery saving my uterus, when  other doctors thought it would have to be removed. Not very chatty, but that's Ok with me.  "
635,38317,1.0,"Elderly Spaniard who is rude, crude, unhelpful and indifferent to any woman with feelings--treats women and (female) staff with extreme disrespect.   Why would he choose a specialty where he treats women&#63;  He thrust his finger up my vagina and said &quot;That's all right!&quot;  Need I say more&#63; "
636,38317,1.0,"I saw Dr. Sanz on 5 different occasions for a surgical consultation for an imperferated hymen. he was generally unhelpful during the first few visits.  during my post surgical follow ups he touched me in a manner that made me uncomfortable on several occasions. I chose not to do any more follow ups with him and returned to my regular gyn.  Since my last visit, I have received multiple bills for miscellaneous items that have been paid. The hospital recently submitted these claims to a collection agency even though they have been paid in full.  I strongly recommend staying away from this doctor and hospital altogether.  "
637,38317,1.0,"I felt well taken care of by the staff. They were the most helpful and friendliest that I have come in contact with in a long time. Dr. Sanz was also personable and is the area's expert on uterine prolapse, which is what I saw him for.  "
638,38317,1.0,Terrible bedside manners! Could not believe a doctor could be so disrespectful. He spends five minutes with you and then leaves you with his nurse practitioner or other assistant. Nonsense advices. Saw another woman leaving his office with words &quot;I wasted my time and money&quot;. 
639,38318,1.0,Dr Singh is the best neurosurgeon and the best doctor period that I have ever been associated with in my life.  He took time and very tender care of my father who had a glioblastoma and great care of us--his family.  I have often told my family since 1984 that if I ever need brain surgery to take me back to Virginia and find Dr. Singh.  
640,38318,1.0,"I'M A 32 YEAR OLD FEMALE WITH TRIGEMINAL NEURALGIA. DR. SAHNI WAS THE FIRST DOCTOR IN 2 YEARS TO GIVE ME A RAY OF HOPE. MAYO, DUKE, AND OTHERS WERE A WASTE OF TIME!! SAHNI TRULY SAVED MY LIFE. I LIVE IN SOUTH CAROLINA AND HAD BEEN ALL OVER THE EAST COAST FOR HELP WITH ZERO RESULTS. THANKS TO DR. SAHNI, I HAVE BEEN PAIN FREE SINCE MY MICROVASCULAR DECOMPRESSION SURGERY IN APRIL OF 2009. I HAVE GIVEN HIS NUMBER TO MORE THAN TEN PEOPLE SO FAR AND ALL HAVE FELT BLESSED TO KNOW HIM. IF YOU HAVE TN, THIS IS THE MAN TO SEE. I COULDN'T ASK FOR A BETTER DOCTOR OR MAN. HE CARES ABOUT HIS PATIENTS AND IS TRULY CONCERNED ABOUT THEIR SUFFERING. MY LIFE HAS BEEN FOREVER CHANGED BECAUSE OF DR.  SAHNI!! "

642,38318,1.0,"I have had two surgeries by Dr Sahni--one in July 2007 and the last in August 2008--the latter was Gamma Knife Surgery for Trigeminal Neuralgia (TN). TN is a nerve disorder of unknown origin that causes sudden shock-like facial pains. Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is not fatal, but it is universally considered to be the most painful affliction known to medical practice.  By many, it's called the &quot;suicide disease.&quot;   The exact cause of TN is not fully understood.  Dr Sahni gave me hope for the first time to reduce my pain.  If you have undiagnosed facial pain, get educated at the Trigeminal Neuralgia Support website (http://www.fpa-support.org/index.html) formerly known as endthepain.org.  Then get an appointment with Dr Sahni.  "
643,38319,0.0,"My husband, kids, father and I all see Dr. Said. She is polite, professional, and extremely knowledgeable. She takes the time to explain the problem and potential treatments, always taking the conservative approach. We feel comfortable trusting the care of our children with her as well. My older kids both play sports (soccer, football and baseball) and we feel that having their feet checked now will prevent problems in the future. We love Dr.  Said and refer her to anyone we know who needs a podiatrist! "
644,38319,0.0,The worst of the worst.. she told me I have foot pain because I am too fat.

646,38320,1.0,Great service and wonderful outcome with Dr. Saffan and Shady Grove.  Highly recommend everone who has fertility issues to go see him.  
647,38320,1.0,Dr. Saffan is really good. Wasn't afraid to consult with my other RE to get me the best possible care. Dominion refused to work with me because of my extremely complicated history. But SG is willing to work with me.  
648,38320,1.0,"I was accepted on Shady Grove shared risk after failed IVF in another practice. Dr. Saffan appeared a little grumpy in our first meeting, but we learned more from him in our first consultation than we did the entire time with the other practice! We didnt see much of him during the whole process as my tests usually fell on weekends, and he didnt do retrieval or transfer but we knew he was always there. However, the whole team at SG are incredibly professional and having been through this before and knowing you dont always get the same doctor, it was incredibly reassuring to know they had the hand offs to Rockville and process perfected. I am now pregnant with twins and Dr. S has been great. People criticize SG for being too machine-like and less personal, but this was not my experience and believe me, you need a practice who get all parts of the entire process right! They have it down. You still have to manage the situation - a few mistakes were made along the way, but overall great.  "
649,38320,1.0,"Dr Saffan is a good doctor who unfortunately works in a bad system.  We felt like he was really pulling for us, but every other staff member we encountered was very rushed.  Our nurse gave us incorrect instructions and the billing department was horrible.  "
650,38320,1.0,Dr Saffon diagnosed a simple problem with one of my tubes.  They cut it off and boom...pregnant via IVF with ICSI with twins.  After 7 tries at Walter Reed and all their so called &quot;Specialists in reproductive endocrinology&quot;  (residents) we gave up and went civilian where Dr Saffon saw it like a target on a dartboard.  Duh... Walter Reed...too many cooks spoil the broth. 
651,38320,1.0,"After a very negative experience with Dr Michael Dimattina of Dominion Fertility, we went to Dr David Saffan and RN Pam Collins via a personal recommendation. We have been extremely impressed so far. Dr Saffan is humane, very caring and although phenomenally busy takes the time to study and ponder each individual case. He is very good at explaining and presenting the options. In general, we have found Shady Grove to be very professional but also able to give the personal touch. Pam and the other nurses are great - Pam was assigned to us and is immensely knowledgable and able to help steer us through the minefield of IVF decisions. We are very optimistic about achieving success with Dr Saffan. Best of all, we know that even if it doesn't happen then we have done everything possible to maximise our chances by working with the best doctor available. "

653,38322,0.0,Dr. Conda has been my Dr. for 15 years. She cares deeply for her patients. She always takes as much time that is needed to help everyone that she sees. I would not trust any one else with my health.  She is the best.

655,38323,0.0,"I really like Marilyn.  She has a great demeanor about her and really tells it like she sees it.  She's kind, but honest and I really needed that.  I needed someone who would tell me when what I was feeling was valid, but more importantly when it might not be.  She tells me when I am wrong without making me feel stupid or immature (even if that's exactly what I am being)  ha.  I've seen a lot of therapists - I use them more as coaches than to solve my problems, and I am so glad I found her in Virginia Beach.  "
656,38323,0.0,Marilyn is very kind and caring and gives wonderful advice.  
657,38323,0.0,"Ms. Salasky is NOT a physican. She is a licensed clinical social worker and my therapist and I thought she should be listed on this site. She is a fantastic counselor. She makes sure that before you leave, she addresses your concerns and provides lots of feedback. Lots of therapists don't do that - they leave everything up to you to talk about and end up figuring out. I'm paying for advice - not to go to an office and talk by myself for an hour! She allows me to bring family members that I have issues with and she is very good with them also. She doesn't always tell me I'm right and lets me know when I am in the wrong etc. Anyway, I would recommend Ms. Salasky for counseling services. She has years of experience.  "

662,38325,0.0,"She did not remember me or my symptoms/issues, not matter how long i had been seening her. She did not give me the why behind a diagnosis and does not communicate well with me. Many times there was something wrong she wanted to test for but i never found out until after the test came back fine. thats scary and i want someone to be upfront. she is very defensive if you ask questions. Down grades your problems if she has had a similar experience. Doctors should never do that. They should listen and be empathetic.... everyone is different.  "
663,38326,1.0,"By far the best family practice doc!  Highly recommended due to his excellent communication skills, bed side manners, and knowledge base.  "
664,38327,0.0,This doctor is a good listener and did a great job of explaining everything to me. I highly recommend her.  
665,38327,0.0,"I have good doctors. Never had one who really, really cared as much. Smart, kind, personable, empathetic. Never wrote a review before but I felt I had to let everyone know.  What a great person and doctor! "
666,38327,0.0,Dr. Salcedo has been my doctor for over 10 years. I have been so blessed to have a talented doctor like her.  She explains everything in an easy to understand manner.  There is nobody in the world that I would not trust with my GI tract than her. 
667,38327,0.0,Cares about her patients.  Takes time to explain procedures and conditions.  Easy to understand and remembers YOUR case very well.  
668,38328,1.0,I had 3 nasal /sinus surgeries with Dr. Saidi. Excellent doctor in all ENT things related. He was competent and confident....he actually took time to listen to what I was saying and how I felt. His staff both clinical and non clinical were a fine example of professionalism. I highly recommend paying Dr. Saidi a visit if you are tired of your sinus or allergy problems. He did a great job for me.  
669,38329,1.0,Dr Sacknoff basically saved me when I had an enlarged prostate. His surgery went well. His staff was very kind and helpful.  I would reccommend him in a heart beat!! 
670,38329,1.0,"I have been going to Dr. Sacknoff for the last 5 years or so.  During the first year I had 2 different episodes of kidney stones, one of which he treated with a stint followed by Lipotripsy, when that procedure finally became available.  He has kept me stone-free now for the last 3.5 years!  He is an excellent doctor in his field, exceedingly knowledgable and has a great personality and bedside manner.  He also explains things in language you can understand.   I am giving him the highest rating possible! "
671,38329,1.0,"Dr. Sacknoff was terrible; in my situation, he performed a very dated procedure which left me with negativie repercussions for weeks. His nurse at the time was appalling, and gave me insensitive answers. At my follow-up weeks later, he gave me fruitless advice; it has taken me almost 3 years to solve my uro-gyno problems, and he was the first in a list of many useless doctors quick to solve my problem with a procedure that seems to not have been necessary in the first place. Of course, hindsight is 20-20 and I'm 1,000 percent better in the right care, but to be clear, it's not because of him.  "
672,38329,1.0,Dr Sacknoff is a very caring and concerned doctor for the health of his patients.  He is a professional with an outstanding bedside manner rarely found in younger physicans.  He has a great sense of humor that puts his patient and their family members at ease.  Returns phone calls the same day.  
673,38329,1.0,"Found a place on my testicle that I did not know about save me from a deadly cancer..Great Doc very thoughtful,kind..  "
674,38329,1.0,Dr. Sacknoff treated me with no respect. He only lectured me on things that are absolutely none of his business & has nothing to do with what I was seeing him for. He is very sarcastic & unprofessional. 
675,38330,2.0,"very attentive, knowledgeable.  Excellent surgeon "
676,38331,0.0,"Love her!  I had a major issue, needed surgery and she was awesome.  Took time, explained everything.   Best gym I've ever had! "
677,38331,0.0,"Stay away! Dr. Sadr diagnosed me with PCOS but then didn't tell me what to expect with such a diagnosis. I told her I'd been having pregnancy symptoms (and my husband and I had been trying to conceive), and- since it ended up that I was NOT pregnant- she suggested I was having a hysterical pregnancy!!! I broke down in tears from fear of what was happening to me, and she told me to find a new doctor.  DONE AND DONE!!!  I had to research PCOS on my own to learn that common pregnancy symptoms ARE part of it.  I've never felt so belittled. "
678,38331,0.0,Dr. Sadr was wonderful during my entire pregnancy all the way up through the birth of my son.  I felt very comfortable with her and she was very thorough at every exam.  I am so thankful that I had Dr. Sadr.  I dont have anything but praise for her and all the doctors at Tidewater Physicians For Women. 
679,38331,0.0,Dr. Sadr and her staff go above and beyond to try to resolve any issue. She is attentive and ready to give as many options as possible to provide the best outcome. She makes you feel in control of your healthcare by working with you. 
680,38331,0.0,"i felt rushed throughout my entire visit. the nurse put me in the room for an examination and 2seconds later the doctor walks in &quot;are you ready!!!&quot; but i was not ready, still ggetting undressed. she then says &quot;well im ready whenever you are&quot; with an attitude.i was the only patient there. i showed up on time for my appointment so the rush was not needed. then i heard her talking outside of the door saying how she needs to hurry up and go home to walk her dog. completely unprofessional, rude, and attitude was uncalled for. i do not recommend anyone to this doctor "
681,38331,0.0,"I wouldn't send my dog to this lady! I had a blighted ovum at 13 weeks and she gave me pills to induce a miscarriage. Afterwards when all the tissue was still inside my uterus, she said &quot;Oh, well, I didn't think it would work.&quot; I ended up having to have a D & C 2 weeks later anyway! She could have saved me a lot of heartache and agony by just doing the D & C instead of experimenting on me! STAY AWAY! "
682,38332,0.0,she is the worst neologist ever ! perscribes medication they have band over 8 years ago because people where dying from it. Lied to me and told me i would have to be monitored weekly while taking Reglin... which is a very safe medication that she tried to perscribe me that is not recommended for my condition so i could keep paying $283.00 to go in there and not even have my blood pressure takin or any type of exam. ! 
683,38332,0.0,"Horrible, like other review said, she sits behind her computer typing instead of listening to the patient. She seems very indifferent and does not accurately diagnose. While asking questions she ignores or does not give a strait answer. She makes me feel uncomfortable and rushed. Not a good personality or a doctor. "
684,38332,0.0,Did not show concern for the patient who was a young girl.  Everything was done sitting behind a desk typing on her computer.  If child continued to have a seizure she just increased meds. Only had blood work done one time and the child was on 4 different meds.  Finally told us she could not help the patient and suggested finding another doctor. Best advice she had given us.  
685,38333,2.0, 
686,38334,0.0,"I've reviewed dr. Santiago in the past but feel like I need to update. I had my first child with her and couldn't have been happier with her. Dr. Bissell is horrible, run from her. I have to say I still really like dr Santiago and her nurses, they are fantastic. But the rest of the staff is terrible and the reason I'm probably going go leave. I've since lost 2 pregnancies and have had a hard time getting a hold of dr Santiago in the process. One time I called every day for a week, the staff took a message and said she would call back, forgetting to mention she was on vacation that week. The second time I just can't a return call period. I still don't have results from an ultrasound 5 weeks ago. If I had a normal pregnancy I'd go back but at this point the staff has made me too anxious about not being able to talk to a dr. I truly love her as a dr but they are too busy with an uncaring staff.  "
687,38334,0.0,Went through 2nd pregnancy with Santiago. She was very caring and took time to explain what was going on. I went into labor early so Bissel delivered my baby via c-section (great job btw)!! Now I'm with baby #3 and the practice has CHANGED! The wait times are terrible. I'm talking upto to 2 hours from the time you get there to the time you leave. Some of us have jobs people! Plus once they see you I feel rushed like I'm at a clinic. She (and the rest of the Dr's) seem a bit impatient now. Who ever is scheduling the appts. so close together is stressing out the Drs' and killing the practice. Several people I have referred have left or are leaving. She is a GREAT Doctor but the office manager is making her and the others loose clients.  
688,38334,0.0,"Dr. Santiago is a fantastic doctor.  She is extremely knowledgable, and has an excellent bedside manner.  I highly recommend her to anyone looking for a OB/GYN.  "
689,38334,0.0,"I really don't understand why the past couple reviews were so bad...it's quite uncharacteristic of the Dr. Santiago I know.  I had a high risk pregnancy, and she was always easy to reach on the phone, followed up with me all the time, and always took every precaution to make sure that my baby and I were well cared for.  As for the in-and-out approach...that can solely be traced back to the office staff.  They schedule these docs for 10 minute appointments. (as in, the doc has appointments scheduled every 10 minutes).  Crazy!  If the office staff would quit doing this, we'd all get the attention we deserved.  Basically, don't take out your frustrations on wait time, etc. on the nurses or the docs.  I'm trying for baby number 2 and I've postponed moving my family to our new home (out of state) just so I can see Dr. Santiago...I don't trust anyone else to handle my or my pregnancy.  Quite simply, she's the best.  "
690,38334,0.0,"I was referred to Dr. Santiago by my general practitioner due to having chronic vaginal discomfort. Dr. Santiago seemed nice in the beginning but was clearly frustrated with me when I answered one of her questions in a manner she seemed to not approve. Everything went downhill from there.  She didn't seem interested in discussing my medical history nor wanting to get to the root of the problem.  During the exam, I tried to explain where my pain was located and, once again, she got frustrated with me for I wasn’t using the correct medical terms.  Dr. Santiago basically said she could not see anything so wasn’t able to determine my problem.  She gave me a prescription but with no directions and rushed out the door.  I was so horrified by this experience I was emotional as I walked out the door.  I understand that Dr. Santiago probably had a busy schedule, but there was no reason for her not take the time to get to know me and advise me.  "
691,38334,0.0,"As a new patient, I was very disappointed in the rushed, 'drive-thru' manner in which this practice operates. Especially for an initial visit, a top-notch gynecologist actually reviews your medical history with you via a consult in addition to the actual exam. This was NOT the case with Dr. Santiago. While she seems nice, she wasn’t diligent or on par with other gyn's I've seen the past. Her care was 'bare minimums': she never asked about things like my iron level, calcium, nor did she do any bloodwork so that she could clearly understand for herself my gyn needs as a middle-aged woman. I will definitely follow up with another doctor shortly so that I can get the care I sought here.  "
692,38334,0.0,"Dr. Santiago is the best. I am not too fond of the office staff, but it's worth putting up with their rudeness to see such a great doctor like Dr. Santiago. She spends as much time as needed with you, explaining everything thoroughly and without restraint.  She is amazing! "
693,38334,0.0,"What a great doctor. She is always friendly, talkative, and seems to really care. She explains things a lot more than the other doctors, as well.  "
694,38334,0.0,"Dr. Santiago is a God send for my first pregnancy, she always takes the time to answer questions, will let you think about what you want to ask, is helpful, cheerful, makes you feel at east at all times. I love her and can't imagine having anyone else deliver my child.  "
695,38334,0.0,"I love Dr. Santiago. She is smart and kind, and she takes the time to make sure you've asked all of the questions you have. She was not my regular doctor, but I got to know her when I was pregnant. She delivered my son, and when we decided I needed a c-section (something I had not planned), she really helped me through the decision-making, answering all of my questions and making sure I was comfortable with it.  "
696,38334,0.0,Love Dr. Santiago! She was helpful for both my annual pap and also when I became pregnant. She takes time to answer all questions and puts me at ease. She even answered questions over the phone which saved me a few visits (and copays) to the office. 
697,38334,0.0,"Dr.Jennifer Santiago was the most incredible doctor I ever had. She helped me so much during my difficult time TTC and while pregnant. I had an emergency stillbirth delivery at 22 weeks, and she was by my side every second through that awful night. I could never of gotten through the loss without her. She is the most amazing doctor ever. She recently left her practice in Reston, and joined Inova in Alexandria. I was so sad to see her leave. I can't express how wonderful Dr.Santiago was with me!! "
698,38334,0.0,"I will never ever go back to Dr. Santiago. My first visit her was good, but that was only general pap/mamogram test. Later after a month I was detected with ectopic pregnancy. I felt she was very rude and doesn't share much info. She didn't make me understand what is tubal pregnancy. She never seemed to be concerned. I was so scared because it is very painful. After the treatment, when i was seeing progress, instead of making me feel relaxed she scared me saying ectopic pregnancy might not have been cured. The severe pain might come back anytime. She always in hurry to leave the room and not answer the questions. Fortunately I took second opinion from a different doctor. They told me that it got cured. I would never suggest anyone to Dr. Santiago for pregnancy, may be only for pap test/mamogram. "
699,38334,0.0,Switched to Dr. Santiago and really like her a lot! Took time to get to know me and I didn't feel rushed out of the office. Went over all options and suggestions and took the &quot;lets try the least invasive&quot; approach first.  
700,38334,0.0,Dr. Santiago is outstanding!! She took the time to address my questions and did so in a kind and professional manner.  She exhibits high knowledge of women's gynecological issues and I would recommend her without reservation!! 
701,38334,0.0,Dr. Santiago was excellent. She has a great bed side manner and is very caring and concerned. She is thorough and listens to all your concerns and addresses them. I would recommend her to all my friends and family. 
702,38335,0.0,"Beautiful facility, lovely caring staff. But,  Lisa Samaha  attempts to gouge you by trying to manipulate and shame you into unnecessary cosmetic dentistry. I was given a quote of over 55,000.00! I am now seeing a dentist for a quarter of the cost. I do not want cosmetic work, just general dentistry.  Dr. Samaha is not comfortable with the  natural state of teeth; even suggestion that they are ugly if not redone via cosmetic dentistry.  Frightening and unfortunate thought process for a dentist.  Her staff is wonderful but clearly unhappy under her dictatorship. I have even heard her say cruel things behind the backs of other patients.  Knowledgeable yet greedy, backstabbing. I am not going to finance her gorgeous office space  by being coerced into tens of thousands of dollars of unnecessary work. I am however, willing to pay for quality work and reasonable overhead. "
703,38335,0.0,Dr Samaha is in fact the best dentist I have ever been to. She is very knowledgeable and compassionate. Her staff is so supportive and sweet. I was treated like one of the family from the moment I walked in for my consultation. I would definately recommend Dr S to anyone who is looking for a new dentist. My only regret is that I didnt meet her sooner! 
704,38336,2.0,"Dr. Sailer has done more to help me with a skin condition I have had for 30 years, than all of the dermatologists I have seen. "
705,38337,1.0,Dr. Sabharwal is very personable and extremely knowledgeable.  He pays attention when you tell him something and orders tests when necessary to check for/rule out different problems.  He keeps close tabs on my blood work and adjusts my medicine accordingly.  
706,38338,1.0,"Poor bedside manners,very opionionated and was not compassionate to my needs as a patient. "
707,38338,1.0,A very good doctor - spends alot of time with his patients.  Only drawback is that he is not punctual.  
708,38338,1.0,Dr Sager is a thorough Dr. that truly cares about the health of his patients. He spends as much time as needed and never makes you feel rushed. He is easy to talk to and he is easy to trust.  A++ 
709,38338,1.0,"I had Dr. Sager as my primary care physician for a number of years (until he left our UHC plan). I can't say enough good things. He had great advice; was easy to talk to; didn't ever make you feel guilty, but was careful to give you a good sense of the state of your health. Fantastic doctor!... wish I could get him back on our plan.  "
710,38338,1.0,Have been going to Dr. Sager for 20 years. Very knowledgeable and straighforward.  
711,38338,1.0,"Dr. Sager is our family doctor, always takes time to explain and ensure understanding and a complete diagnosis. His thoroughness saved my father's life. He is the best doctor we have ever had. May run late, but worth waiting for. Really cares for his patients. "
712,38338,1.0,"Dr. Sager was extremely helpful and offered insight into my health as it related to my job. Provided me with more specific detail than I had previously had from a physician with similar specialty. Would highly recommend him, particularly to anyone in aviation.  "
713,38338,1.0,"I used Dr. Sager for 10+ years ending in 2003. He is an outstanding, caring doctor who frequently runs late because he takes the time to explain what's going on in your body. As a primary care giver, I've never had better... I'm 61.  "
714,38339,0.0,"My daughter had a severe case of mono that lasted for 3 weeks during which time she had 104 degree temps and horrible stomach pains. After seeing other doctors in the practice, we finally saw Dr Sadak. She explained thing better, kept a watchful eye on her condition and provided excellent care. I felt like i had finally found someone who was really helpful and on top of her case.  "
715,38343,2.0," Put off root canal work to fit their schedule--was improperly done--had to go to endodontist in Roanoke--have it redone at cost of $1,100.00 "
716,38358,1.0," This dentist is rude, short-tempered, and not at all gentle with his procedures.  On top of this, he has (in my opinion) fraudulent billing practices that leave you with considerable out of pocket expenses.  Do not believe him when he tells you that the bill you are agreeing to will be fully reimbursed by insurance.  What he does is bill you for unnecessary procedures, which insurance ultimately does not cover, then you're stuck with the difference.  From other message boards, it sounds like this is routine with this doctor office.   Do NOT go to this guy if you have ANY OTHER choice! "
717,38358,1.0," Have been his patient for several years. Good practitioner,  but the office is a mess with things strewn all over.The office needs to be spruced up quite a bit, such as painting, etc. At times, he has left me in the chair, not telling me when he would be back, for an extended period of time, even when there has not been another patient. At times, he can be quite rude,stand offish, and not considerate of his patient's needs and comfort. His receptionist/assistant&#63;&#63; Is very pleasant and friendly. To her credit, when I have had a dental emergency, she has promptly scheduled me...  I have contemplated changing dentists, and perhaps I will at some point, but since he is such an excellent practitioner, I have &quot;accepted&quot; the aforementioned shortcomings "
718,38358,1.0, Very rude and unfriendly service.  Pays no mind to patient's level of comfort. Has a very cranky attitude. Definitly NOT recommended. 
719,38358,1.0,.   
720,38358,1.0," He can be an odd duck but is an excellent practitioner.  Dentist, not hygenist does cleanings/xrays, etc. "
721,38358,1.0," Office is dirty and unsanitary. Equipment is old (lights are broken, bugs inside). Doctor has anger issues when things don't go as planned. During crown replacement he yelled at me while in dentist chair because I was bleeding too much. When another patient arrived he left me in chair for 34 minutes until he finished the person's routine cleaning. Worst ever, am seeking legal action. "
722,38366,1.0," My husband and I have been patients of Dr. Ueno for 3 years and will continue to be patients for a long time. Dr. Ueno has helped address short term and chronic conditions, many of which were not property treated by other physicians.  Dr. Ueno is experienced, knowledgeable, and takes the time to understand the situation and answer questions.  He provides everything you would want from your doctor including a great bed side manner.  "
723,38366,1.0," I had an amazing experience with Dr. Ueno, he helped me tremendously and everyone in the office was very friendly and helpful. I would recommend him to anyone with any ailment, go try accupuncture with Dr. Ueno first. "
724,38366,1.0," Tetsuhiro is a patient listener, calming presence, confident in his practice and its benefits, and spends as much time with you as you need for treatment planning, etc.  I was nervous about trying acupuncture for the first time but was at wits end following 3 failed artificial insemination attempts at conception and over 3 years of trying.  I received 3 treatments around the time of our 4th insemination and our tests came back positive!  we couldn't believe it!  I am due in 8 weeks and couldn't be happier with my experience. "
725,38366,1.0," I have been getting acupuncture treatments for the past two months to treat depression.  I amazed to learn that depression is a symptom from my weakened liver.  Since I have been treated by Dr. Ueno I am no longer on anti-depressants and I feel really good.  He is also treating me with Chinese Herbs.  It is such a relaxing and fun experience having acupuncture.  It does not hurt at all infact its very calming.  I also have had insomnia for years.  There are times when I am up for 48 hours.  Dr. Ueno gave me a new herb to help with this condition and I have slept live a baby for the first time in years.  I am so happy that I have found Advanced Health Center.  I can tell that Dr. Ueno is healing my body.  I learn so much during our sessions about Traditional Chinese Medicine.  Please visit the office! They have so many excellent therapies available and very affordable rates! Also, its not like a doctors office where its impersonal.  I always have fun when I go. The staff is great too. Paid/Co-pay:$80"
726,38366,1.0," Dr. Ueno is really great. I have a chronic GI disease, and with his acupuncture and herbs I've improved so much (compared to how I was doing on prescription drugs). He was willing to try different things until we found something that worked well. He and everyone in the office are professional and friendly. I highly recommend him. "
727,38366,1.0," I had a wonderful experience with Dr. Ueno. After undergoing an early miscarriage and subsequent difficulty in getting pregnant, I decided to try acupuncture as an alternative to fertility medication. From the first visit, Dr. Ueno was extremely encouraging and supportive. He performed a thorough assessment of my health history and current condition to determine the best course of action. As I have never tried acupuncture before, he was happy to address my questions and concerns. As a result, the acupuncture treatments combined with herbal supplements significantly reduced the stress and anxiety that I was experiencing, as well as improved the blood circulation and elevated my overall level of energy. After two months of acupuncture treatment I got pregnant, but still continued with the sessions as a means of maintaining a healthy pregnancy. My son just turned 1, and I will definitely continue to see Dr. Ueno for acupuncture for overall health and as we plan for a second child. "
728,38366,1.0," This was a wonderful experience! I am a nurse and have suffered for years with joint problems, so I finally decided to try acupuncture and I'm so happy I did! The office staff are always smiling, friendly, and helpful. They provided all the documents for me to send claims to my insurance company, all I had to do was mail them. Dr. Ueno is amazing - so friendly, cheerful, comforting, and knowledgeable. He was very respectful of my knowledge of Western medicine as well, always comparing and contrasting &quot;his&quot; medicine vs. &quot;mine.&quot; The truth is, acupuncture helped me in a way no other Western medicine could, and I have tried many many different specialists and medicines. Acupuncture really works and is worth every penny. This office will provide you with all you need and make you feel like you are the priority. As I told Dr. Ueno on my last visit, he's changed my life! "
729,38366,1.0," I highly recommend Dr. Ueno.  He is extremely knowledgeable and has overall a very gentle technique and demeanor.  I saw Dr. Ueno for a bad shoulder injury (from a bike accident), and nagging abdominal pain.  The treatments helped enormously, and I am now working out and exercising better than I have in years. "
730,38366,1.0," I began to see Dr Ueno last winter when I was suffering from tinnitus and sensitivity in both ears.  Dr Ueno is a very professional practioner who listens well to patients and adjusts his treatment to their needs.  I am happy to report that within a month I had considerable improvement to the hearing sensitivity problems I was having, as well as some improvement to my tinnitus.  Ear problems such as mine are difficult to diagnose and treat, and I went to Dr. Ueno when other avenues failed to lead to any progress.  I highly recommend Dr Ueno, personally, and would also recommend acupuncture as a potential treatment for hearing problems such as tinnitus, hyperacusis and related conditions. "
731,38366,1.0," I went to see Dr. Ueno for treatment for depression.  Its been just over 2 WEEKS and I’m feeling better already! He has given me Chinese herbs &amp; I have had a 3 acupuncture sessions. The cause of my problem&#63; A weak liver, which contributed to symptoms of depression.  I also learned that antidepressants which I have been taking for years had weaken my liver.  This is a fascinating treatment.  Dr. Ueno has patients who are now depression and antidepressant-free.  This is encouraging news for someone like who has suffered with depression for years.  I am so optimistic about the future...this is just the beginning! Results in 2 weeks!!! I must say...I also had treatment 2 years ago for weak bladder.  I had to go to the bathroom all the time.  After a few sessions and the Chinese herbs to this day I don't have that problem anymore!  Advanced Health is the best! Thank you Dr. Ueno, you have helped me so much and are so nice and pleasant and a great educator.  I have learned so much. Paid/Co-pay:$80"
732,38366,1.0," Dr. Ueno treated me for Bell's Palsy in January-March 2011. He was thorough in his diagnosis and was an excellent care giver. I was certain on the first visit that his treatments would provide relief. When he inserted a needle at one point in my cheek, my eye immediately went closed (for the first time in a week since the onset).  I appreciated the gentle, competent care. I saw steady improvement over the 6 weeks and felt that I had regained over 90% control over my facial muscles by the last treatment. If you need an acupuncturist and you are in DC or northern Virginia, I highly recommend Dr. Ueno. "
733,38366,1.0," AMAZING!! Dr. Ueno is best acupuncturist that me and my wife have ever been too (and we have travel extensively in the Asia). His skill, knowledge and overall manor is the perfect combination for holistic healing. "
734,38366,1.0," I am happy to write an unqualified testimonial for Dr. Tetsuhiro Ueno and his staff. Some months ago, I began going to Dr. Ueno for a nagging soreness in my right knee. With his expert, friendly, no high pressure sales pitch treatments, Dr. Ueno helped me immeasurably -- not just with the knee but also several persistent medical conditions which had proven unamenable to more conventional medical care (I had almost given up hope on finding relief for these conditions). So, I am very indebted to Dr. Ueno; he is a wonderful, skilled healer. And I recommend him without reservation! "
735,38377,2.0,.   
736,38384,1.0," Dr. Udoff is the worst.  He has terrible judgment and his mistake at a critical point in our treatment had disastrous results.  Afterwards, he offered no apology but became defensive and hard to contact.  Avoid this so-called doctor!!! Paid/Co-pay:$20000"
737,38385,2.0, Greatest Ever in the History of Psyschology 
738,38387,2.0," Best experience with Dentist and entire staff. Very professional, knowledegeable, and friendly. I am happy I finally found a great Dentist! "
739,38392,2.0, Dr. Usnick is wonderful.  The office is very clean. 
740,38395,1.0," this doctor refered me to another doctor,when he has never seen me as a patient! "

742,38406,1.0," Dr. Usman is exactly what one would hope to find in a doctor.  He is knowledgable, patient, compassionate, friendly.  I have been his patient for over seven years and each encounter has been extremely positive.  He is concerned not only for an individual's skin health but total body health as well. I have raved about him to friends and this site is a wonderful opportunity to let others know his qualifications. "
743,38406,1.0," I disagree..he doesn't take his time when examining patients.It sort of felt like he was going through the motions. I went in for a check up and he basically pushed me out of the office in 5 minutes, with a presription. He needs to make his job a little bit more personal. How else can you treat a patient if you don't. "
744,38406,1.0," Dr. Usman is such an amazing doctor. He makes you feel so comfortable and really knows his stuff! He will answer all your questions and make sure that you feel completely 100% satisfied before leaving his office. I was a patient that went in fairly often and he always fit me into his schedule even if it meant he had to stay late or see me in-between other patients.  Awesome doctor! Awesome personality! Awesome staff! Would highly recommend him to anyone seeking a dermatologist, or even a switch from the one you are using now! "
745,38407,2.0, I was having issues with prescription &amp; it took 3 days for the drs nurse to return my call.  Labels on prescription bottles were incorrect &amp; confusing.  
746,38423,1.0," Dr. Ubert is the most knowledgeable Chiropractor I've seen.  He is very willing to discuss why and how he is going to treat you.  I'm an endurance athlete and he fully understands the &quot;extra&quot; care and precautions needed to keep me healthy. And each visit has never had less than 30 minutes of actual &quot;face time&quot;, as opposed to other Chiropractors.  "
747,38423,1.0,.  The only chiropractor our family trusts! 
748,38425,1.0," Long wait for new patient appointments.  Doctor very knowledgeable and personable. Rescheduling appointments not immediate, may require several months to see again.  "

753,38428,0.0,Very helpful and caring. She really tries to understand the patient and almost put herself in their shoes to fully understand the problem. Great doctor; would highly recommend.

756,38429,1.0,"Martin Wein - Clinical Psychologist, Richmond VA. He runs his practice out of a spare room in his house. That means that all questions about billing, insurance, etc. are handled directly by him. If you have an urgent need to talk to him, you call his number and you are connected directly to him. No secretaries or extensions to dial or directories to search through. He is honest, straightforward, and to the point. Doesn't waste any time. VERY highly recommended. If you have an urgent problem, need help now, and don't know what to do, he will tell you exactly what's going on and what you need to do to fix it, without beating around the bush. I spent one session with him that lasted about 45 minutes and I feel like a completely different person. If you need to talk to someone, call Martin Wein. You'll be glad you did! "
757,38430,0.0,Dr. Way is exceptionally knowledgeable and has a wonderful demeanor.  She truly cares for her patients well being and is willing to take time out of her busy schedule to check up with patients and their progress. I would recommend Dr. Way to any and all my friends and family.  
758,38431,0.0,Dr. Wakatsuki provided me with the best care I could have wanted. She listened and responded. I am searching for her so I can continue to employ her services. I highly recommend her to everyone. 
759,38431,0.0,Dr. Wakatsuki was an outstanding physician. She was very compassionate and communicative. She listens better than almost any other physician I know. She's current on medical treatments and doesn't dither. I know that her previous employer was the cause of the time and question limits; I know she was frustrated with the time limits and push for volume. I recommend her highly to anyone. I'd follow her anywhere if I could figure out where she went.  
760,38431,0.0,"A George Washington School of Medicine Grad.The best,most friendly, and most knowledgable G.P. that I know. "
761,38431,0.0,"I visited Dr. Wakatsuki twice asking for help with a few problems. After examining me by touching my knee she diagnosed me with beginning osteoporosis and send me for x-rays. Since nothing showed up, she recommended me to keep exercising. She had no follow up although my joint problem is getting worse. Couple other problems were treated in similar way. I also recall that I was very suprised to read a note on the door in the waiting room stating that you can only ask 3 questions during your examination. I do not feel that she cared to find out cause of my health problems.  "
762,38432,1.0,"I find him professional and just fine with his doctor-patient relations. The hygeinists seem top-rate, as well as the facilities used at this office. Everything is clean and computerized. One note, there is a little more talk of church and of teeth-whitening than I prefer at this office. "
763,38432,1.0,"He knows his stuff, but very impersonal. I would not recommend him and his practice for good patient-dentist relationship. If you want a dentist that examines your wallet more than your teeth, be my guest and go to him.  "
764,38433,0.0,What a wonderful doctor! She has knowledge in both oriental and western medicine. I feel so much better physically and mentally when she gives me acupuncture and Chinese herbs. WONDERFUL! Doesn't care about the money and unlike other acupuncturists she really cared about my health rather than her wealth. I would highly recommend Dr. Wang.  
765,38433,0.0,"I have severe back pain. I've had two MRI and X-ray procedures that show nothing being wrong. Doctors are not able to explain why I have the pain. I tried everything, including physical therapy but nothing worked. After acupuncture treatments from Dr. Wang, there is no pain in my back. Dr. Wang has given me back my life. "
766,38434,1.0, 
767,38434,1.0,If he's ever late it's because he really listens to his patients. He is interested in any area of your life as it effects your health. He will not coddle you and tells you what you need to hear.  I;m sure he's saved my life and HMA has the best team of doctors anywhere.  
768,38434,1.0,Very busy office but that's a small price to pay for the best doctor I've ever seen.  He's blunt andto the point but also listens to his patients own feelings about what's going on with their health and medicines.  He is very knowledgeable about medicines and willing to run tests for those things he's not sure of.  
769,38434,1.0,"Fine person and great doctor. Thorough knowledge and interest in caring for the whole patient make him less a pill pusher and more of a support team. Respectful of what I know and what works for me. Realistic, can be tough, but does care about doing his job well.  "
770,38435,2.0,Absolutely terrible and rude. Not knowledgeable or able to answer questions.  
771,38436,1.0,"This doctor and his staff are hands down the absolute worst I have ever experienced. First he kept me waiting well past my appt time. Then he proceeded to try and hand me a contact lens on his own finger rather than allowing me to get up, wash my hands and retrieve the lens from the package myself. The doctor actually left the room several times, touched the door knobs and god knows what else then returned &amp; resumed the exam, never rewashing his hands. The day after I woke up with an irritated eye. I  called his office, he would not take my calls, the staff was threatening and rude. Finally went there, doctor literally laughed at me, refused any responsibility and refused even a partial refund. I have never had a doctor cause me harm. He is unhygenic, generally disgusting and he and his staff are rude even threatening. Also parking is difficult at this office park. Never go here. NEVER. "
772,38437,1.0,"Dr. Wang has been my doctor for over a year and a half now.  He and his staff have been wonderful in helping me with a life long battle with a Esophageal Stricture.  Now, after 35 or so years of having difficulty eating, I can now eat normally.  His knowledge and caring during this process has helped me believe that their are still parent focused doctors still around.  "
773,38437,1.0,"This Dr cares only about the money. After he placed a drain in my stomach and a stent in my pancreas, I lost my job. His office would not see me any longer since I had know insurance. The stent was not meant to be left for more than 3 wks, it was left in more than 12 before I could get it removed. This has caused permanent damage to my pancreas that cannot be reversed.  "
774,38438,1.0,"Defensive and holds a &quot;common cold&quot; chart up on his wall so that he can point to it and make you feel like an idiot. This guys is something else. I have an sinus infection and he prescribed me a low-dose antibiotic. When I went back to him a few days later, first of all he forgot that he had just seen me days before. Then, he would not up my dosage of antibiotic and declared my condition a &quot;virus&quot;. This is despite the fact that he already prescribed me an antibiotic a few days before! I'm totally unimpressed.  "
775,38439,0.0,She has been my dentist for over 5 years. She is amazing. 
776,38440,1.0,Dr. Wagner and his office saved my husband's vision! He had weak spots on his retina due to his eye shape. His retina detached four times! Dr. Wagner and staff repaired my husband's eye with very little loss of vision. If you read the NIH website there usually is vision loss or blindness in the affected eye after two detachments.  
777,38440,1.0,This was the fastest eye doctor's appointment I have ever had.  I wasn't rushed.  The flow of having all my tests and scans was great.  Dr. Wagner was as charming as always. 
778,38440,1.0,usually wait a few hours to see him.  When he finally does examine me jt is only for a few minutes.  I thought i would give him another chance...when i made an appt with him I made sure it was first thing in the am and i STILL had to wait at least an hour before i was seen.   Ridiculous! 
779,38440,1.0,Dr. Wagner seems unconcerned and rushed. There is always a wait. In the past he has spoken about his wife running for office and his popcorn business. Most staff is helpful and frindly. I am pleased that there are other qualified retina doctors now in the area.  
780,38440,1.0,"I have been seen by Dr. Wagner for 6 yrs. and recently had surgery to correct a detached vitreous. I have never had such a pleasant surgery and follow up experience.  Dr. Wagner and his staff were excellent and I had a speedy recovery and my sight restored due to his expertise and treatment. Yes Dr. Wagner's waiting room is always full in his VA Beach office, and you can always count on a wait.  But, this is understandable due to his excellent reputation as a retina specialist in this area.  His staff routinely offers snacks to waiting patients and beverages are always available to make patients comfortable.  Dr. Wagner's expertise and friendly compassionate manner are worth the wait.  "
781,38440,1.0,"Dr. Wagner is a very nice man when he sticks to his specialty. Unfortunately, he has an agenda that has nothing to do with Ophthalmology. The last time I saw him instead of giving me a qualified diagnosis on my eyes, he instead commented on my weight. In fact, he never once commented on the reason for my visit, but rather spent the entire time telling me how to lose weight and handing me a sheet of paper on books to read about weight loss. If you are skinny, like he is, then he's a great doctor. If you are fat, then be ready for 15 minutes of &quot;weight loss 101&quot;. "
782,38440,1.0, 
783,38441,1.0,"He is awful. He does NOT like women. Everything you have is blamed on your &quot;time of the month&quot; or one week after your &quot;time of the month&quot; or two weeks after your &quot;time of the month&quot;. In a car accident and break your arm&#63; Oh, he will find a way to say it has something to do with your being a woman and your &quot;time of the month&quot;. If you don't care if you live or die, then go to this doctor. If you care about yourself, FIND A REAL DOCTOR.  "
784,38441,1.0,"I've gone to Dr Webb for almost 10 years.  The last few years, the nurses and Dr Webb want to rush me through their office.  I don't feel like a person there anymore.  It's been two years (I have been patient and have tried many things on my own), and it's apparently not possible to get proper treatment for my problem.  At my last appointment, Dr Webb called me a Nihilist rather than asking me why I did not follow the treatments recommended by two specialists.  After his name calling, I spoke up and informed him why.  I stopped the first specialist's treatment because it caused issues elsewhere on my body, and I did not want to trade one problem for another AND regularly take antibiotics.  I didn't start allergy shots because the allergist recommended them and said they may not even work (takes many years to find out).  I mainly went to the allergist because my father had gone and was diagnosed with some allergies.  I also thought I had an allergy to a certain food (I didn't).  "
785,38441,1.0,"I've used Dr. Webb for more than six years. I see him at least once per year for an annual check-up. The primary reason for seeing him is my hereditary high cholesterol (260-280), which is now down to the 170-180 range. I have been on cholesterol medication since the age of 12. I am now 25.  "
786,38442,0.0,"The office is so poorly run that it is virtually impossible to get any kind of question answered.  The office staff is condescending and rude. Out of the three times I had lab work done, twice there were mistakes. Dr. Weber does spend a lot of time on the computer, and overall I felt like she really didn't enjoy being a doctor.  "
787,38442,0.0,Terrible experience.  She seemed as if she was not there.  Really unresponsive and too consumed with her laptop and cart she pushes it around with.  Would not recommend her to anyone.  I waited 45 minutes in the waiting room and there was no one else there but me.  Terrible.  
788,38442,0.0,"horrible doctor, heard she was bad, but first visit was OK, after that it went downhill. Will NOT listen to you, has her own opinions, you walk out worse tha when you went in. Uses a computer during visit, never looks up at you.  "
789,38443,2.0,"Great doctor, listens to patients, follows up after visit.  "
790,38444,2.0,does not listen to patient questions or concerns. does not do test that patient ask for. in a hurry to get visit over with. does not help with getting disability 
791,38445,0.0,"out of all the doctors ive ever been to she was the Best Dr i ever went to. she actually talks not like other doctors who you have to pull teeth to get them to say anything. she answers most my questions before i ask them. explains everything, and suggests solutions without me having to ask for every little thing.  highly recommend "
792,38445,0.0, 
793,38446,0.0,they have always told me ahead of time what i owed and what will happen at that visit.  She is a great doctor and i trust her! highly recommended! 
794,38446,0.0,Dr. Wasan is awesome. Her nurse Sandy is fantastic too. I highly recommend this practice.  
795,38446,0.0,Dr.  Wasan is one of the BEST allergists in the area!  My whole family is SO happy with her!  I HIGHLY recommend her! 
796,38446,0.0,She is wonderful! Very patient and knowledgeable. Great bedside manners! Very happy with how she's treating my son who has asthma.  I would recommend her to everyone! 
797,38446,0.0,"She and her staff still work like an old time doctor office - if you are sick, she sees you - including fitting you in - and then you still wait only a few minutes. "
798,38447,0.0,I found Dr. Warner to be very skilled and insightful.  She communicated warmth and compassion and was an important part of my recovery from addiction to drugs and alcohol.  She is extensively trained in addiction medicine and I consider myself very fortunate to have been under her care during this critical period of my life. 
799,38448,1.0,love him!! he is excellent doctor and always willing to help you with anything that you have  a concern about. i am high risk and he was very compassionate and helpful through my every week doctor appointments and extensive tests!HIGHLY RECOMMENED HIM TO ANYONE!!! tahnks to my sister for the high recomendations on him ;) 
800,38448,1.0,"Office has cancelled many prematal appts. Showed up ontime for appt while receptionist was on a call (work related... another patient having problems) I quietly seated myself for the 20 minutes it took her to handle call... the went up to receptionist to let her know i was there.  She notified Dr Walsh that I was there... other people came in and were taken back right away to see Dr. Walsh (one of whom did not have appt)... when I asked receptionist, she called back to ask why I hadnt been called in... was told that it was because I was 20 Minutes late, they were going to work me in!!I also have had issue with this Dr as he will not induce my labor. I am over 39 weeks, Dr has not done vaginal exam since first trimester... I am having a large baby (already over 8lbs, confirmed by ultrasound) and have had a normal pregnancy.  Both of my prev preg required induction. I am concerned that baby is going to be too large to deliver vaginally... I do not want a c-sec.  "
801,38448,1.0,Dr. Walsh delivered my son and will deliver my daughter here soon. I had a complicated pregnancy with my son and he was very helpful! I had pre-term at 33 weeks with my son and visited the ER about 6 different times before I was induced. He just would tell me what to do and send me on my way. I highly recomend him. With this pregnancy I have had pains and what not through out and he has made it a breeze.  
802,38448,1.0,Dr Walsh is wonderful.   He has such a calm and caring demeanor.  I've referred my sister and several of my girlfriends to him and they all feel the same way.  Dr Walsh also is a very skilled surgeon.  He performed a laproscopic hysterectomy on me which really minimized healing time after surgery.  Two other doctors I had previously seen insisted that the only way to do my surgery was with a large abdominal incision.  I'm really glad I found this doctor.  
803,38448,1.0,Dr. Walsh was extremely caring and compassionate during a very difficult and high risk pregnancy.  I'm now on my second pregnancy and hope to never have to change to another physician. He always made me feel that he had time to answer my questions.  I had a lot!!.   He even stayed late to deliver me on a night he wasn't on call -- that sort of dedication just doesn't happen any more! 
804,38448,1.0,He is a really nice doctor and makes you feel comfortable. I have only ever had a woman doctor until I lost my job and had to get medicaid. Thankfully they accepted me there. His two nurses are really kind and help with any questions that you may have as well.  Everyone is very knowledgable and always in a good mood! 
805,38448,1.0,"He was very uncooperative and would not work with me with what was on my birth plan.  I had researched extensively and had cleared my birth plan with the other two doctors in the practice.  They were okay with it, but Dr. Walsh argued with me over it and would not honor my wishes.  This was over such things as delayed cord clamping and placing the baby on my abdomen while cord was still attached.  He also would not agree to take a hands off approach with the delivery of the placenta.  I wanted to wait until it detached on its own.  We discussed this early in labor but when the time came, he ignored our discussion and pulled on the cord hastening the delivery of the placenta.  I also asked that he not massage or pinch the cord until it stopped pulsating so that the baby could receive all the blood it needed (and oxygen through that blood).  I thought we'd agreed on this but my doula later told me that she saw him rubbing the cord when my husband and I were preoccupied with the baby. "
806,38449,1.0,"Going to see this Doctor was a terrible experience. It's bad enough being in horrible back pain with someone who is supposed to help treat me in a condescending and insulting manner. The first thing he said to me is, &quot;I like to inject people with big needles&quot;. When I told him I would like to try other treatments he began lecturing me about cigarette smoking. He charged my insurance for this visit and charged me a copay. For doing nothing but insult me. I DO NOT recommend this person at all.  "
807,38449,1.0,"Dr. Wagner is my life saver. Before meeting him, I thought I would be a handicap due to my backpain. I am now active again and able to enjoy playing tennis and doing weight and muscle training.  "
808,38449,1.0,Wonderful doctor. Very caring and puts his patients first. He is the type of doctor that does his best to get you better and is willing to go out of his way for you. I am much better since he started treating me and I suffered for years before I was treated by Dr. Wagner.  
809,38449,1.0,"GREAT DOC. Fantastic, superb, unbeleivably nice. Great bedside manners. "
810,38449,1.0,I've had prolotherapy w/ Dr. Wagner and my pain is gone. I checked with my insurance and their website (BlueCross) and they do not cover prolotherapy. They classified prolotherapy as &quot;experimental&quot;. Prolotherapy isn't experimental. It works. Dr. Wagner is terrific. The insurance companies are the bad guys. Thank god that there are doctors out there that are willing to help us despite what the insurance companies say. He will go the extra mile to find out what is wrong with you and make sure that you get the best treatment possible. He explained all my options and involved me in the treatment process.  
811,38449,1.0,"Dr. Wagner is the nicest and most knowledgeable doctor I know in pain management.  He was able to, not only diagnosed my back problem (herniated disc) and later torn tendon on my shoulder, but treated me with prolotherapy which saved me from having surgery and live a normal life.  I disagree with comments made about his bed-side manner and dishonesty.  He couldn't be more truthful when he told me BC/BS would not cover prolotherapy.  I checked and they do not. I highly recommend him and will continue to see him.  I have Dr. Wagner to thank for having my life back.  "
812,38449,1.0,"Robert H Wagner is judgmental, dismissive, condescending, and projects his thoughts onto you. He refused to address a medical issue related to the main issue I was complaining about, even though I had written that issue in as a complaint. He said, &quot;We're not addressing that today.&quot; He kept telling me what I was probably thinking. His comments were unprofessional. He didn't answer questions seriously. I expressed surprise at one of his responses and he said, &quot;I was kidding.&quot; Is this doctor for real&#63; I do not, I repeat, I DO NOT recommend him to anyone.  "
813,38449,1.0,"Wagner is a reasonably decent doctor, but he commits insurance fraud on a daily basis.  He refuses to allow the insurance companies to pay him for prolotherapy, claiming that they will not pay (when in reality they often will).  That would be fine and dandy if he did not also claim to be a &quot;preferred provider&quot; for those same insurance companies.  So in essence, he is having his cake and eating it, too.  And yet because so many of his patients are desperate souls in horrible pain, he gets away with it.  Those people are not in a position to challenge his fraud. "
814,38449,1.0,"Dr. Wagner is amazing.  I suffered with unusual back pain for several years while several doctors had no idea how to help me.  I was referred to Dr. Wagner, and he was the first doctor to lay out a full plan for my recovery.  He is the most skilled at giving injections of anyone I've ever encountered, and the pain relief he helped me experience has truly changed my life.  He always explained all my options to me, as well as what we would do if the current option wasn't enough.  He truly was an angel to me and I will be forever grateful.   I recommend him whole-heartedly and without reservation! "
815,38449,1.0,Great doctor. Saw him in Fairfax. He knew what my problem was immediately. I saw several docs before him but he was the only one that knew what the problem was.  
816,38449,1.0,Dr. Wagner knew how to treat my back pain immediately and with great success. I was referred to him by Dr. Hope. I feel confident that I will be able to forego surgery for many years.  I have great confidence in him! 
817,38450,1.0,"I love Dr Walker, and cannot say enough good things about him. He never rushes through appointments. He is wonderful with my special needs child, and he always respects my opinion as the parent. Because of him, my child loves going to the doctor and has made the connection that she needs to go to the doctor when she doesn't feel right. Dr Walker always remembers my child and the particulars with her case. Dr Walker is the perfect example of how doctors should treat their patients, and in this case, the patient's parents.  I would not take my child to anyone else! "
818,38450,1.0,THE best pediatrician ever!  Takes time to discuss illness and treatment with the parents.  He treats each child as if they are the most important.  He is my daughters favorite doctor! 
819,38450,1.0,You might have to wait a few extra minutes on Dr. Walker but it's well worth it. He has never made me feel rushed during our appointments. He is wonderful with my kids. One of my favorite things about Dr. Walker is that he always wants to know my take on things. He stands by the idea that a parent knows their child best. He is very calm and soft spoken. Absolutely ... everything a pediatrician should be. 
820,38451,1.0,"He was my M.D. for a couple of years, and I kind of have mixed feelings about him. He's knowledgable, but a little nuts at times. You will usually get sound medical advice, but he might preach to you about Jesus. You might feel like he really cares one day, and feel belittled the next. I'm not trying to be smug but I feel he spends half his time worshipping Jesus, and the other half thinking he IS Jesus. The more intelligent you are the stranger you will find him. "
821,38451,1.0,"I love Dr. Ware! He was knowledgeable, took his time, and taught me. I felt listened to and he explained things to me clearly. He also recommended books and referral sources. I'd recommend him to anyone in my family.  "
822,38451,1.0,Very knowledgeable doctor who spends a decent amount of time with patients.  I've been there about 5 times and found Dr Ware very competent and effective.  My only complaint is the long wait to see him 
823,38451,1.0,"save yourself and don't go to this doctor, you will regret it.  the only thing he cares about is how fast he could get out his office so he could see other patient, any time you ask him a question about any health problem that may concern you.  the only answer you will get from him.  you need to make another appointment and we will discuss it this way, once again the more you came the more money he makes.  if you didn' take my advice and you decide to go see him, do yourself a favor for example if you trying to see him at 1200 make sure you tell them 1000 because you going to wait 1 hour at the waiting area and when it 's your time to go in they put you in this room and make you wait another hour.  and finally when he shows up, he will rush so quick because once again he has other people waiting.  furthermore, one day i had a bad ear infection, when i went to see him he once again rushed me and said you ear looks fine, the next day i had to go to the emergency room. and they found i had infection.  "
824,38451,1.0,Dr. Ware is absolutley terrible.  I was having symptoms of fatigue and he basically told me it was just stress and poor nutrition.  I had some lab work done and it showed some of my thyroid levels were elevated.  The level that was elevated was actually a test doctors use as a tumor marker in patients with thyroid cancer. He did not bring this to my attention.  I asked him if I should pursue this further and he told me to just change my diet and come back in 3 months.  I decided to see an endocrinologist on my own.  To make a long story short it turned out to be thyroid cancer.  I had seen him 2 years before that visit with the same symptoms and he ignored it.  My cancer spread outside my thyroid.  If he would of done further testing on the initial visit the cancer would not have spread.  I would not recommend this doctor to anyone. If I hadn't seen another doctor I would never have been diagnosed.  
825,38451,1.0,"I would never recommend this docotor to anyone.  Every time I go in there, I get a lecture about how the only way to stay  healthy is to eat fruits and vegetables.  I always wait a minumum of an hour to even leave the waiting room plus another 30 minutes to an hour in the exam room for 5 minutes of facetime with the doctor.  He never address my real problem, but instead lectures me about what is wrong in the world.  When asked if I should (as a woman) be concerned with vitamin intake, especailly calcium, he said you diet should provide everything.  However, every other scientific study has shown that calcium supplements for women are important.  He ran my bloodwork inproperly and did not bother to explain the results. I am an educated person, especially in the areas of science and medicine, and what he is telling me does not make sense.  I would stay away from this office at all costs.  "
826,38451,1.0,"I would never recommend this doctor.  He always comes across as being smarter than everyone else and he mis-diagnosed me on what could have been a very embarrassing and permanent condition...he read my lab results incorrectly and I after getting a second opinion, found out that I didn't have anything wrong with me.  When he told me the diagnosis, he acted very non-chalant about it and made me feel like an idiot for questioning what he told me.  He did not prescribe anything for the treatment of what he said I had, which I thought odd, and brushed off my questions and my disbelief.  However, he was very quick to recommend magnesium suppliments and cod liver oil, which he did all the time, and told me, once again, not to tell any other doctors as they aren't as smart, or forward thinking, about these things as he is.  Plus, his front line staff ALWAYS had to ask me what my co-pay was rather than having it on file....come across as very lazy.  "
827,38451,1.0,Dr. Ware's office was routinely difficult to deal with. On nearly every visit I was forced to wait appox 1 hour past my appointment time. The incident that promted me to leave Dr. Ware's care was a misdiagnosis of a urological condition. Dr. Ware was insistent that my issue could be solve by advil and cod liver oil. I had to return to his office 10 times and argue with him several times before being referred to a compitent specialist for my issue.

831,38453,1.0,"Dr. Warner is an exceptional physician, he is attentive, thoughtful, skilled and extremely knowledgeable.  He is kind, particularly with the elderly, giving them whatever time necessary to discuss their condition, treatment, etc.  Unfortunately his office staff is challenging, difficult to get through to dr, staff not helpful in making appointments, not able to offer and/or carry out other alternative solutions, such as leaving a message for the doctor, and they take an inordinate amount of time returning calls, if they do at all without additional messages being left.  A great deal of responsibility placed on patient to continue to call if the doctor is not available/out of town which is stressful, to say the least, on cardiac patients, particularly elderly ones in poor health.  Understandably he is very busy but needs to be supported by competent staff.  Dr. Warner is an outstanding cardiologist and we have been fortunate to be treated by such a fine doctor.  "

She sits down, looks relaxed, and actually talks with me about my daughter. She is confident in her diagnoses but respectfully refers me to specialists if needed.  She tells it like it is.  She'll ask about my daughter's schedule and gives me advice on feeding and bedtime. I will refer her to my friends! "
844,38460,1.0,"not help at all he does not take the time to explain the things he said and underestimate my pain, I know that he is a wise person but he could read images but not the feelings of the people May he think that i could not pay but is wrong i pay him cvash because i never like to use credit cards i really think that his recommendations were short and i felt that he do not take me seriously in my condition , after see him i went to a second opinion and really explain every single thing is happening inside my body and the recommendations and medications and most important treat me with respect and took his time to listen and answer all my questions .

846,38460,1.0,I met Dr. Whattenmaker after going to (2) orthopedic physicians and being diagnosed with a herniated L4/S1 disc 6 months prior. However this diagnosis was made with the MRI coming back negative showing nothing but I was in severe pain. I took my films from Reston Hospital and had Dr. Whattenmaker look them over. What was not found on the films by the first physicians was a small grey area on the bottom left called arthritis which encouraged Dr. Whattenmaker to take an MRI of my left hip. The MRI came back positive for Osteoporosis (bone on bone) in the left hip. I decided to look for a specialist Dr. Thomas P Gross (The BIOMET Recap Femoral and Magnum Acetabular System) sitehttp://www.grossortho.com/doctor.htmWithout Dr. Whattenmaker’s experience and professionalism this would have been a disaster.  
847,38460,1.0,He's a great doc and doesn't jump the gun for surgery. I had 2 docs say I needed surgery immediately and dr wattenmaker took the time to actually explain my situation. I did end up having surgery but only after exhausting all other options. Surgery went great and recovery only took 2 week and I was back working on cars after 1 week.  I wouldn't recomend anyone else 
848,38460,1.0,"He rejected me as a patient, trying to downplay my need for surgery so that he wouldn't have to take me as a patient.  After conferring with two other reputable surgeons (as well as the three doctors who recommended surgery), surgery was the only option.  However, he delayed the process, which increased my time in excruciating pain.  He is arrogant and condescending.  Get a second opinion if you see him first.  "
849,38460,1.0,I found both the staff and Dr. Wattenmaker to be very friendly and professional. Dr. Wattenmaker had to perform cervical surgery to include adding titaninum rods to my neck. He was so caring and concerned. He made what was a very scary experience a not so bad one. Thank you Dr. Ian.  
850,38460,1.0,"I went to Dr. Wattenmaker for a second opinion on my back. He was so friendly and I did not feel rushed at all. I was able to ask him all of the questions I needed to. The first doctor I went to wanted to do surgery on my back. Dr. Wattenmaker looked at my scans and talked to me about the kind of pain I had. He said he diagnoses the patient, not the MRI. He said that if it were his back, he would not do the surgery. We talked about lifestyle choices that are better for my back. So, I decided not to go through with surgery and I'm grateful for it. I have no back pain now. "

After only one visit with her she released me from the practice on my second visit b/c I rescheduled one of my appointments  due to a work conflict and I also opted out of of one the recommended prenatal tests (but not required - I was also having a healthy pregnancy) I called to discuss this over the phone with her prior to our second appointment and only her nurse would return my calls and after hours so that when I returned her call I would only get their voicemail system. I was never actually able to resolve any issues or discuss my decision as she just basically fired me as a patient on my second appointment I did not do exactly as she wanted. (I may have listened to her if we had a discussion but was never given the opportunity) I was always under the impression that doctors should discuss patients concerns and give them options and also help explain things, not the case here. Very bad bedside manner.  "

I've referred 4 friends to her, and all of them love her.  I highly recommend her - my pre-natal, delivery and postnatal care were all wonderful. I had to have a LEEP done before I got pregnant with our 2nd - it was a very emotional time, but her informative yet caring approach helped me through it.  "

She has delivered both of our children, one of which was diagnosed with Trisomy-18, and ultimately passed away shortly after birth.  During the time leading up to delivery, she was very informative and helped navigate us through some some extremely tough decisions.  During both pregancies she always took as much time as needed to make sure we were always properly informed.  Furthermore she has a wonderful, friendly personality and made us feel like we were part of her family.  Any woman would be extremely fortunate to have her as their physician.  "

869,38466,0.0,"Service was rated poor due to being forgotten about while waiting to be seen by the doctor. After being diagnosed by the doctor after finally being seen, the doctor forgot to write out the prescriptions.  I was sent to a secondary doctor for a sleep study and was found to have a severe case of sleep apnea. Due to not being able to sleep at night I could not properly function at work. My insurance company needed the doctor to fill out the necessary paper work diagnosing my sickness in which the doctor would not do. I was diagnosed with sleep apnea on 12/18/08 and still do not have a CPAP machine(01/07/09) to help me breath while attemting to sleep. I have had to visit the emergency room in between this time due to complications breathing with heart attack and stroke like symptoms. All symtoms seem to occur when trying to sleep.

She was made to wait nearly an hour for her appointment and was given a trash can to throw up in while waiting in the emergency room. I believe that because my mother is a medicare patient, she was given less than acceptable care. Many of Dr. Waddell's staff members were rude and unhelpful, both over the phone and in person. I will be helping my mother to find a different doctor, one that can be trusted to give equitable care to all patients. "

875,38471,0.0,"Saw Dr. Weaver a few years back for my child's newborn and follow-up visits. Now I won't see her even if she's the first doc available for a sick visit. My child was born quite prematurely and had to be seen the day after discharge from NICU. S/he was very jaundiced, and of course as new parents, we had a few other concerns, all of which were communicated to the nurse. The first thing Dr. Weaver said on walking in the room was, &quot;You know not to give her/him honey, right&#63;&quot; Uh...okay. She spent the rest of the visit dispensing these random gems of wisdom (e.g. Q: &quot;Can mom eat peanut butter while nursing&#63;&quot; A: &quot;Only if she's as picky as a 2-year-old and won't eat anything else.&quot; And: &quot;Make sure no long hair becomes wrapped around baby's appendages.&quot;) Her focus was on these silly matters rather than the medical significant ones. The whole thing finished with a plug for Cetaphil, which had been made in the appt before ours as well. Similar behavior occurred at subsequent visits.  Avoid! "

883,38477,1.0,"Dr Wallach was able to do what six doctors could not--- diagnose my back issues and recommend a treatment to get me healed to return to work.  The previous doctors went with the easy diagnosis - mild herniation of L3 to S1. But they also said the herniations could not possibly cause this much pain.  Dr Wallach listened to my symptoms which were very specific.  He conducted what I now know as the Faber test along with the physical exam, and determined I had SIJD.  God Bless the man!!!  Having the right diagnosis after 1 1/2 years is a miracle.  Unlike the past where I received Facet and ESI from the other doctors, Dr Wallach recommended a noninvasive plan and  after four weeks of PT and chiro, I have greatly improved feeling stronger and more stable.

The following day I went to Sam's Club and they would not take back an open box of contacts so I decided to head back to the optometrist to claim what was obligated. However, when I arrived the receptionist was not there and when I told Weingart what she had told me he began shouting and arguing with me. He kept shouting &quot;No you're wrong&quot; repeatedly at the top of his lungs, called me a liar, and said that his receptionist would never say something like that.

Answer: No.  Both staff and Dr. Wei herself turned us away b/c of their made-up document authenticity requirements.  I'm a practicing attorney and understand the need to verify documents, however, turning away pediatric patients that have been waiting months b/c Dr. Wei won't accept a copy of a valid BC/BS PPO card is UNCONSCIONABLE, UNPROFESSIONAL, and probably violative of her professional duties.  tl;dr Dr. Wei refused to see a 5 year-old patient b/c she refused to accept a copy of his insurance card.

They stated that the person responsible for scheduling the MRI would be contacting me after she authorized through my insurance, I called back three days later and even stopped by the desk on the way out to ask about the status of my MRI request, and they told me &quot;your insurance has to authorize it firts&quot;. I called my insurance a week later, and guess what! No one had contacted my insurance in regards to authorizing anything. Go Figure!

I was 23 and had gone from a highly functioning, optimist to a non-functioning, almost bedridden young adult.

905,38488,1.0,"Amazing doctor. He took the time to listen to my concerns and is very knowledgable. His office is very busy so if you are a new patient, you may have to wait 3-4 weeks to see him, but be patient because he is worth the wait.  His front desk staff is also very helpful and efficient!

The doctor LISTENED patiently to my concerns and suggested me to take a HIDA scan in addition to the tests I had done previously with another Gastroenterologist as this would accurately determine whether I should or shouldn't have the surgery done, in all outcomes the doctor did recommend to have the surgery done as later the stones could move lead to more serious complications.

910,38490,1.0,"I had breast cancer 7 years ago.  Dr Walter was kind, concern, and went out of his way to ensure everything from surgery, to radition, to chemo went as it should.  He recommended touch not radiation and oncology specialists, and consulted with them to provide me the best care possible.  The surgical scars are barely visible.  Last year, he and my oncologist stated that I'm cured.  I will continue to see him for my checkups because he knows my history.  I trust him and would recommend him again.  "
911,38490,1.0,"I had a very bad experience with Dr. Walter. I saw him because he was the first available doc in his group and I had a hernia that needed immediate attention. After the surgery, he dismissed my concerns that the repair didn't work and said the mesh is almost a sure fix. He never even touched my stomach when I came back after the surgery (two visits post-op since it still hurt). My primary care doc ordered an unltrasound when I complained to her and there was clearly still a hernia. I saw a new doc who took pics when she went in to do the procedure. Both pieces of mesh were balled-up in wads. No wonder it hurt! She thinks he did this when he closed the incision, pulling the patches off just as quickly has he placed them. If he had bothered to listen to me, I could have had this fixed 18 months ago, instead of dealing with the pain every time I laid down or got out of bed. Doctors like Barry Walter need to learn how to listen to their patients rather than being arrogant and dismissive.  "
912,38490,1.0,A FIRST CLASS SUGEON WITH AN EXCELLENT OFFICE AND SURGICAL STAFF.REMOVED A LARGE TUMOR FROM MY RIGHT GROIN.ABSOLUTELY THE BEST SURGERY I HAVE EVER HAD.  
913,38490,1.0,I had surgery back in February and have been very pleased with Dr. Walter.  I recommend him.  I've had no complications or complaints from the surgery and only follow up with him because I had a medical device implanted that needs to be checked periodically. 
914,38490,1.0,"performed surgery for a abdominal hernia. Used what was then the new procedure called &quot;mesh&quot;. Less than a year later I returned due to still having a bulge, he claimed it was ok. Three yrs later I returned again due to still having a bulge, he said it was still ok. Went to my PCP doc approx 6mo ago for a full physical when she informed me that the hernia was NOT ok and needed surgery on it as soon as possible or I run the risk of strgulation of my intestines. Also screws that hold the mesh in place began to push through my skin & come loose 6mo after surgery, he attempted to remove them in the office with scapel in hand and no anethesia. Excrutiatingly painful and bloody, so he ended up having to remove them in a hospital setting. Do NOT go to this guy, he is a ****.  "
915,38490,1.0,"He did surgery on me last year, was careless and cut a piece of my bladder off and put me together wrong.  Now I have to go and have everything done all over.  The new surgeon has no idea what he will find because they could not do the colonoscopies on me.  The doctor from last year made a blockage.   DO NOT EVER GO TO HIM "
916,38490,1.0,"He is a very good surgeon, but his bedside manner is nonexistent. He spends very little time with patients, explaining procedures and answering questions, but then he is in a very busy practice. "
917,38491,1.0,I have gone to Dr Weingold for both knees and have never had a problem.  My family has used Dr Weingold many times and have never had a problem with him. I found him to be very helpfull for me my wife and my mother and brother inlaw.  I will use Dr Weingold again when needed and will send my friends and the  rest of my family.  Great doctor because he cares and will listen to your pain.  
918,38491,1.0,"Dr. Weingold was great with my son. He took the time to explain his condition and the steps we needed to get him back to sports. He answered all our questions thoughtfully, showed us the x-rays and prescribed the right treatment. He has taken care of our whole family and I strongly recommend him to my friends and coworkers.  "
919,38491,1.0,"6 months after my initial injury, I finally on my own, sought an MRI.  Dr. Weingold dismissed 2 injuries- one to the ankle and one to the hip- as inconsequential.  I could have had surgery along time ago and gotten back to my life rather than slugging through a mirage of guessing games as to what my ailments were- (torn tendon in the ankle and torn cartilage in the hip)- I did not find Dr. Weingold to be at all helpful in getting me back to my life "
920,38491,1.0,No bed-side manner or compassion.  I felt he was indifferent he spent maybe 5 minutes with me and most of that time was reviewing x-rays - not talking with or listening to me.  
921,38491,1.0,Doctor was quite condescending and unsympathetic.  He talked over us when we tried to explain our reasons for the visit.  We were his last appointment of the day and he was dismissive when it came to our questions and concerns. 
922,38492,0.0,"My family doc sent me to the ER because my 3 yr old daughter was vomitting for 3 days and badly dehydrated and my 16 month old son was vomitting for 7 days and somewhat dehydrated.  This doc told me to take both home and push fluids.  When told 3 yr old can not keep fluids down, said &quot;I guess we can give her an IV&quot;  He did not think she needed it even though she was pale,listless, glassy eyed, dry mouthed, limp.  Did nothing but write a script for son.  He was more interested in getting the room empty.  I think he is also the same doc I saw 4 years ago who asked me why I was still throwing up at 16 weeks pregnant.   Hmmm, maybe that is why I was brought, nearly unconcious, to th ER&#63;  If you can avoid him, do so, "
923,38493,1.0,". Dr Weinberg is very knowlegible, he listens to you, he cares and he knows what he is doing "
924,38493,1.0,"My first chiro. experience was excellent considering I went in a skeptic, now I'm open to the possiblity that Dr. Weinberg can AND has helped me with managing my lower back pain.  "
925,38494,1.0,Dr. Waters performed two back surgeries on me and I found him to be an excellent doctor.  
926,38495,1.0,"Dr. Weaver has been my doc for over 5 years after moving to the area.  He has been unfailingly helpful and judicious, never patronizing but very focused on overall health and wellness.  The office is well-run if a bit impersonal, although they've always come through when we've needed information.  I have recommended both Herndon Family Medicine and Dr. Weaver to others.  "
927,38495,1.0,Doctor Weaver had resolved my wife and my own medical problems.       My wife was diagnosis as stomach pains for about two years by doctors from another medical institute. Dr. Weaver become her new doctor only about two weeks and decided that her pains was not stomach pain and told her to do ultra sound test. She was found that she has god bladder stones and need urgent surgery.       I had similar condition. I got minor elbow pains from a travel for pulling luggage. later I got very severe pains in my arm with numbness. My elbow pain was gone very easily after taking pain medication but my arm and shoulder pains and numbness were not. He told me to do MRI test and found that I have injuries from an auto accident also and needed urgent surgery.      He also helped me to find a very good neurosurgeon Dr. Donald Hope and neurologist Dr. Robert Richard.      He is really a good doctor and I trust him completely. 
928,38495,1.0,Dr. Weaver is very nice and personable. He also seems to know a lot about health and seems to care about the patient. I definitely recommend him if you are going to Herndon Family Medicine.  
929,38496,1.0,"Dr Webb is fantastic.  My husband's family has been going to him for over 30 years, and for the past 5 years that he has been my dentist I have been very pleased with him and his team.  "
930,38497,1.0,I very very happy with the attention I got from Dr. Wang. This was a first visit and I will continue to see him. I would recommend Dr. Wang. 
931,38498,1.0,"I just had my first appointment with Dr. Walsh, at the recommendation of a friend, and couldn't be more pleased.  Dr. Walsh has a strong academic and clinical pedigree; excellent interpersonal skills; a strong network of specialists for referrals; and, most importantly, made me feel like the only patient in his practice. Based on my initial experience, I strongly recommend Dr. Walsh.  "
932,38498,1.0,Awesome doctor. You probably won't find a better one in Arlington.  Make your appointment now! 
933,38498,1.0,"I had my first appointment with Dr. Walsh and liked him very much.  He was straightforward, easy, and comfortable.  He addressed my concerns and I am glad to know he is there for me as my primary physician.  "
934,38498,1.0,"It's a little discomforting to have a young doctor--I tend to like the stereotypical 65-year-old with 40 years of practice--but for Dr. Walsh, it's totally worth it. I have found Dr. Walsh to be a brilliant practitioner who pays close personal attention to all of his patients. If you're in Northern Virginia, he is not to be missed--if you can get in.  "
935,38498,1.0,Dr. Walsh is very knowledgeable and I would recommend him. 
936,38499,1.0,Dr waddy is wonderful he cares about what you think and feel. He is always polite and caring.  I could not ask for a better family doctor.  His staff top choice always going the extra mile to make you feel at ease at your visit.  Wish more were like this group. 
937,38499,1.0,"Dr. Waddy has a wonderful bed side manner, he's compassionate towards patients, goes the extra mile to ensure you understand your condition/medicine/treatment and asks about the family during my visit. He's skilled and professional to be so young.  The front desk and lab staff has improved greatly over the last few years, those changes did the practice well!! "
938,38499,1.0,You alway walk into a wonderful repectful and refreshing doctor office. It starts from the medical secetaries to nurses than the Dr Waddy. Any problems that you have he will give his best profession advise. He is a wonderful person in and out.

939,38499,1.0,"I was convinced my husband was suffering from allergies and Dr. Waddy saw important signs leading to a heart problem. If not for his skill,my husband could have had even more damage to his heart. I know he gave him a chance at a longer life.  "
940,38499,1.0,"I have been with Dr Waddy for over 3 years, He is the best general practitioner I have been to. He is very good at what he does, he found the right medicine for my ADHD, mind you he is a general practitioner who goes way beyond to help people, my mom has been with him for a long time and also has gotten help far beyond any expectations. Thank you Dr. Waddy, you are the best doctor I have ever been to.  "
941,38499,1.0,I am writing these comments on behalf of my husband who has been seeing Dr. Waddy approximately 1 year.  We are so pleased with his professionalism and thoroughness AND he is  nice!  What a refreshing sense of humor.  We always leave his office feeling so good because we know that he respects us and has given us his very best.   He also has a wonderful support staff.   Signed:  Walter & Bertha White 
942,38499,1.0,"Dr. Waddy is an excellent primary care provider.  What I find refreshing is that if it's something that he isn't familiar with, he'll do a referral and not play around.  He has a great sense of humor and it's a pleasure to visit him.  The only significant problem, and it affects all of North Suffolk Family Medicine, is that they are completely overwhelmed with patients for the space that they have available (the practice is moving into much larger spaces summer 2008).  That lack of space translates into people tripping over one another and longer waits. But Dr. Waddy is always thorough, and if given the choice I'd rather deal with a wait than an overly harried Physician providing rushed service.  There were some problems about 6 months ago with rudeness on the part of some of the office staff.  I've noticed a marked improvement in recent months in that regard and gave a 5 based on my latest experiences.  "
943,38500,1.0,Talks to much and keeps people in braces for 4-5 years! 
944,38500,1.0,"Lack expertise, horrible customer service and Dr Waitkus very unprofessional. "
945,38500,1.0,"Dr. WAitkus is a CON ARTIST and does not follow through with ANY plan he has ever made. Im tired of his lying, and insulting and the attitude he gives to my brother and I. i do NOT reccomend him to anyone or anything. to me he is a FRAUD.  "
946,38500,1.0,"I wanted to recommend Dr.  Waitkus, not only for the high degree of professional quality and pride he has always demonstrated in John's course of treatments, but the human side he has displayed over these years in remembering birthdays, ect and the high degree of rapport he demonstrates with the kids? "
947,38501,1.0,"I do not wish to leave any comment, and hope this is sixty characters so I can nevertheless register the other survey questions. "
948,38501,1.0,"my 2 kids and I have seen dr waldman for many many years and we find him to be engaged, compassionate and knowledgeable. he is more than open and honost in expressing his opinion and why. dr waldman will share the alternative treatments ie as well so you are informed. our family loves him and we freely recommend him.  "
949,38501,1.0,Provides loving care for the entire family.  He has been our doctor for the last 12 years.  
950,38501,1.0,"I was very pleased with this doctor while my mother was under his care. He was caring, helpfull, very knowledgeable and very compasionate not only with his patient but also with the family.  My mom was very lucky to have Dr. Waldman on her bedside during her last weeks of live.  "
951,38501,1.0,"Dr. Waldman is one of the nicest, caring Dr. I have every encountered.  He calms fears, is empathetic, patient and extremely knowledgeable. I am so thankful he was referred to me.  My entire family is now seeing Dr. Waldman and we all have the same feeling about him.  "
952,38501,1.0,"Dr. Waldman is a caring, up-to-date and articulate doctor. He has cared for me in his office and seen me int he hospital.  Top notch! "
953,38501,1.0,Jeffrey is by far the most understanding and knowledgeable doctor. He is very patient while listening to concerns. He offers helpful explanations and suggestions. Doctor Waldman goes above and beyond.  
954,38501,1.0,"Very nice doctor. If he's not on time, it's only because he's so good everyone asks him questions which is completely forgiveable. Very personable and helpful. "
955,38502,1.0,"We've been going to Dr. Weinstein for about 6 months for our well checks.  He's very knowledgable and takes an interest in your children and makes you feel like he really cares.  Unfortunately, he's not always on time and I've had to wait in the exam room for more than 15 minutes (which is long when your child is undressed and is under 3 years of age).  He's very good but could be better (e.g., I think they could do a better job with checking into the child's development and asking whether you have any questions).  "
956,38503,0.0,"Dr. Leslie Webb is an outstanding Doctor. She really truely cares about her patients health.. She is very nice and understanding. She follows up on test and is really concerned in your health. I highly reccomend her to everyone. She has also called me with test results rather than her staff... Take it from me, I don't like doctor's, but she has really changed my thinking about them. Good doctors are hard to find, but great doctors are rae to find.  "
957,38503,0.0,Dr. Leslie Webb was very friendly and polite. She seems very knowledgeable and caring. She has a way of making you feel at ease. I would reccomend her to anyone who needs a cardiologist. 
958,38504,1.0,"Really thorough and thoughtful. Spent a full half hour with me, not distracted by other patients. Focussed on my problem and came up with a diagnosis that two other doctors missed.  "
959,38504,1.0,"Unbelievable. I have been to 4 doctors who had no idea how to treat my symptoms, including 2 GI specialists. He found my ulcer and after 1 week of treatment I felt better for the first time in over 6 months.  "
960,38504,1.0,"Is not patient, doesn't listen and quick to diagnose (mis-diagnose). Has no code of ethics, unprofessional, and rude to say the least. Should not be practicing. "
961,38505,1.0,"This Doctor is only interested in keeping his license.  He is NOT interested in the patient or the best interest of the patient.  HORRIBLE Doctor and took my condition and made it worse!  I have had many doctors in my life time, and he was one of the worst ever.  Not one time did he ever care what my condition was, only wether or not his license to practice was secure.  "
962,38505,1.0,Dr. Weaver called me before I ever went to his office to &quot;get to know me&quot;.First time that has ever happened to me.  Went to his office for subdural injection and it was virtually painless.  Very pleasant demeanor.  Staff was very accomodating. I can't speak to his level of knowledge because I'm not a doctor.  Overall very pleasant experience. 
963,38505,1.0,Dr. Weaver is one of the worst Dr's ever. His knowledge of my health issues were completely wrong even though I brought a copy of my medical records 2 MRI's &amp; a CATscan. He had no information about Gastric Bypass patient's not being able to take Nsaids because they cause bleeding ulcers. He has ZERO bedside manner was actually very rude. Did not bother to read what my other dr's had written about treatments &amp; med's I was taking what worked &amp; what didn't work. After a urine sample he came back in the room &amp; asked me 3 times if I was a drug user &amp; when was the last time I had taken methadone. I told him all 3 times I have only taken what my dr's had prescribed for me &amp; I have never taken methadone. He stated that he was going to send my speciman to a more thorough lab &amp; if it came back showing drugs/methadone he was going to turn me in. I waited for him to call me but after 10 days I called 3 times got hung up on once. He called me &amp; said 3 calls was harassment.  I'm considering a lawsuit 
964,38505,1.0,Dr weaver didn't listen to anything I told him about my current meds or disability.  He didn't look at my body nor do any test.  Prescribed me a med that caused severe side effects and almost killed me.  The office workers are passive aggressive and clueless.   Stay away from this office!!! 
965,38505,1.0,This doc did not even order a current x-ray or MRI before he scheduled me for a epidural injection. Quick visit and the nurse was the one to tell me. I had told him the shots had not worked in the past. I would have expected him to communicate his treatment plan and goals. Based on article I read about him I had such high hopes but the medical care in this area is lacking and its sad.  
966,38505,1.0,"First off, I am a professional computer engineer. In a past life, I was a public servant and was injured in the line of duty, and that requires that I be on pain meds. I recently moved to the area and had to find a dr. I made the appt a month in advance. Once I got to the office, they had me fill out the paperwork, then took me to the back. The doctor looked at the paperwork, and saw that I had been on pain meds for the last several years. That was the only therapy that works for me, I have been through them all, trust me. He sent word through his nurse that he would not be writing a prscription for me. If I wanted to elave I could, but he would not be writing prescritions for me. He didn't once even look at me, or talk to me, no evaluation of my individual situation or anything. Just sent his nurse in to tell me that. BTW, I also didn't have insurance which I am sure played into his decision heavily. If you want a doctor who treats you like a number, go see this guy! If not STAY AWAY! "
967,38505,1.0,Excellent doctor. Would highly recommend him to anyone. Injection worked great and barely felt it.  Wonderful!!!! 
968,38506,1.0,"He currently has no staff.  However, I must enter a rating on his staff. "
969,38507,1.0,I was leary about taking my son to Dr. Wallace after reading some reviews.  I am so glad that he was the only doctor I could use with my insurance.  He is GREAT!! He treated my son great and was very pleasant and professional.  My son had 5 wisdom teeth cut out and went to work the very next evening.  He only took one dose of pain meds and then nothing else.  My sons friend had the same procedure but only 4 wisdom teeth by a doctor in Roanoke and was laid up for 3 days on heavy meds.  Yeah he does wear cowboy boots and the place is not brand new but I did not go there to live.  Dr. Wallace is a nice good ol country boy and is one heck of a dentist.  I highly recommend him.  
970,38507,1.0,"Excellent surgeon.  Outspoken and honest, which is to his credit.  "
971,38507,1.0,This doctor should be put out of business.  I went there for 2 teeth removed.  he immediately began talking about my weight.  So he decided he would pull the teeth even though they needed to be cut.  He never got my mouth numb and tortured me in the dentist chair.  It is so painful I cannot even open my mouth.  I do believe he has left part of the tooth in there.  I tried to go back and let him check it he was RUDE.  His office staff slammed down a syringe and told me to get clove oil.  Did not tell me that clove oil would burn your mouth.  Aetna insurance needs to take a look at this man and boot him off the plan.  I would not even take a DOG to him.  
972,38507,1.0,"The surgery went fantastic which is the one good thing i have to say about Dr wallace and his staff. They were extremely unhelpful up til the point of the actual surgery. They rescheduled on me once at 5 pm in the afternoon when my appt was at 10 am the next day. Then there was a test that needed to be done before i could get the surgery done. Not a big deal. However they had 3 months of dealing with me (consultation and rescheduling due to them) and never mentioned this test. I have an appt on that friday, i get a call mon afternoon to tell me about this test needing to be done. Well unfortunately for me the test takes 3-7 days to come back. This is an unnessasary test per my primary dr. And i had to reschedule again due to the lack of customer service from the staff. Will not recommend him to anyone. Unfortunately insurance wise i did not have any other choice or i would not have set foot in that building.  "
973,38507,1.0,"Due to some of the rebiews, I was a bit skeptical of going to Dr. Wallace to have a tooth pulled.  I am glad to say I was wrong.  Dr. Wallace was GREAT.  Very nice no pain.  Great guy  Thank you Dr. Wallace.  "
974,38507,1.0,"Dr. Wallace was amazing with our son.  He was very professional, experienced, and really compassionate.  The staff was friendly and the office was clean and organized.  The experience we had was great and I would highly recommend Dr. Wallace. "
975,38507,1.0,"Based on other reviews I really didn't want to send my daughter here for her wisdom teeth removal.  However, because of insurance, we were very limited in our choices.  It was actually a very pleasant experience.  Dr. Wallace was polite and informative.  She had very little pain and recovered very quickly.  The office wasn't the newest and they were late taking her back.  But they let me know several times how she was doing and were very kind to her.  All together it was a positive experience for her.  "
976,38507,1.0,"Dr Wallace (I am rating the oral surgeon; please forgive if there is another dentist in Blacksburg with the misfortune to have the same name) was extremely rude and unprofessional to me. I would NEVER recommend him to anyone. Customer reviews reveal a lot; if you decide to go to him, enter at your own risk.  You may be surprised; for the good or not so good. Toss a coin and hope. "
977,38507,1.0,Dr. Wallace was very professional and competent. I had four molar extractions and no pain or complications. Prior reviews seemed to indicate an IQ deficiency of the patient. I recommend Dr.  Wallace 
978,38507,1.0,"I have been reading the reviews and I saw the A$$ 2 days ago and he is still a jerk. I would never refer him to anyone I know.He is the most hateful,hurtful man. I to was asked if I was on drugs when I said NO hes just looked over his glasses at me and wrote something on the cart. He asked me if I worked and I said no he ask why I said I dont have a babysitter he wanted to know the ages of my kids i reply...9 and 12 jerk said well i know lots of people who have kids and work and urs are old enough to take care of themselfs can u belive that....leave my kids home alone at that young age.At this point I had,had enough and just got up and walked out,by the looks i got from him and his staff they were used to people just walking out. What dose that tell u. If anybody is thinking of going to the A$$ please save urself the trouble dont go u will be very disapponited. He is just what all the reviews on here say he is and more. "
979,38507,1.0,"wife went to get tooth pulled dentist was so aarogant,and dispicable it was unbeleiveable.he kept asking her if she did drugs . (she is a good christian woman) then he told her she needed to get her wisdom teeth pulled and ask why she still had her tonsils&#63;&#63; he wore old cowboy boots office equipment looked wore out and office smelled. needless to say we left and didnt go back i dont know how this guys still in business he needs to be shut down! "
980,38507,1.0,I took my daughter to this dr bc she had 4 impacted wisdom teeth. Office smelled like an old old mobile home!  There were flies in the light fixture in the bathroom. Lots and lots of them!! Dr NEVER used gloves when checking my daughter even though they were on a shelf although they had been removed from their sanitary carton and placed in a plastic thing.  Office workers looked to still be in high school except for two nurses.  Dr seemed to be &quot;hitting&quot; on my daughter when I returned to the room from the restroom as he was talking about wishing she could work there!! CREEPY to say the least!! Needless to say we left there and NEVER looked back!  I would never ever even let this doctor work on my pet pig!!!  I will look for another oral surgeon even if I have to go out of network and pay more.  
981,38507,1.0,"AWFUL EXPERIENCE!went to have 2 teeth removed,was very rude,numbed both sides of my mouth (didnt think they were supposed to do that)and also did not wait until i was completely numbed, felt everything. and he broke both my teeth, said it would cost me more if a teeth breaks. my knowledge is that a tooth will not break unless its a bad tooth, or its an accident. stitches are all over the place and very painful. it has been a week and a day and i am still sore. not to mention my appt was at 2:45, wasnt seen til 4. he yelled at me cuz i was crying. well no**** i was crying! i was feeling everything he was doing!!! arent they supposed to ask if you can feel anything FIRST!&#63;!&#63;! he shot me like 10 times with the shot and started pullin n tugging. i wasnt completely numb til i left the dark gloomy creepy office. my insurance only pays for him.  im going to demand i be able to see someone else!!!!!!! DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS DR!! i cant believe hes still in practice!! "
982,38507,1.0,"I had to go to this surgeon b/c my health insurance wasn't accepted anywhere else in town. He was rude and obnoxious and so was his staff. He didn't introduce himself and he wore cowboy books with his scrubs. He hounded me about as to why I still had my wisdome teeth and tonsils. He gave me a hard time about my weight and asked me personal questions that were in no relation to my surgery. He also said that b/c of my weight he couldn't put me under b/c he didn't know if he could resuscitate me. What a way to make me feel comfortable! On the day of my surgery I was upset b/c I had never had any type of surgery before and quite frankly, he scared me! The nurses weren't friendly and barely said a word to me while they were hooking me up to the montitoring equipment. Dr Wallace came in and said that he wouldn't start until I &quot;grew up, stopped acting like a baby and calmed myself down.&quot; I was so thankful when the surgery was over and I was still alive! I DO NOT suggest anyone go to this man! "
983,38507,1.0,"What an awful experience! No one sells hello, and the doc did not even introduce himself. He did not know what tooth #17 was, nor even what my common heart med was. Tried to talk me into having all my wisdom teeth done, at age 47, regardless of complications, even though I only needed one out.  The place is gloomy and dirty. I think the carpet there is original in this old building.  The staff got all my insurance info wrong, and tried to charge me $75, when I had a $50 deductible. As I checked out, there was a pathology report facing me, right in front of me, of some man who had a diagnosis of squamous dysplasia of his tongue.  Talk about HIPPA privacy violations!!!!!!I suspect these people there are all unhappy and underpaid. I did not schedule my surgery and paid again to go elsewhere. Please, go somewhere else if you can! "
984,38507,1.0,This was the most arrogant and hateful man and STAFF that I have ever come across. I came in for a consult for a tooth extraction due to fracture. I was right on time at 2 pm. Another guy came in 15 minutes after I did and was taken back. I asked the staff at 3 how long it was going to take. With no apology and with disgust she said he's in surgery. So around 3:30- my appt was at 2- I was taken back. He looked at the xrays from my dentist-who is nice- and said well it's a fracture and needs to come out and asked why was I there. I told him because novocaine didn't work and my dentist said to have me put under.I was told to do something about my weight and he wouldn't do it.At this time I'm upset and he walked out and said to make an appt.(NOT)So I went with the &quot;lady&quot; to make an appt and she asked if I was ok and I said no.She then walked out.She came back and said I have to pay for this.This place had water spots on the ceiling too. There's not enough room to describe all of this.  
985,38507,1.0,"I had to see this doctor for a few tooth extractions. I am only in my late twenties but my teeth, due to a documented family history, are awful. I am also overweight. When I went in to see the doctor, he first told me I was lying about how much I weighed and asked me &quot;if I was sure&quot; I put the right weight on the form. Then he said he can do the work, which was extensive, but I cannot be put to sleep because he &quot;doesn't know if he could save someone as large as I was&quot; even though a man twice the size of me walked out of the office right before me and thanled him so much for letting him be put under because &quot;he gets nervous at the dentist's office.&quot; I am assuming this dentist/oral surgeoun only likes to do work on thin, model-beautiful female patients, but with men, anything will fly. The office also kept asking if I had enough to pay even though I had already assured them I had MORE than enough. Jerks.... you can't be fat or poor of you see this doctor! "
986,38507,1.0,"Hiddeous, hateful, arrogant @$$. I actually went to him for wisdom tooth extraction over 20 years ago and got up and left. Took my son 5 years ago, same experience. They hound u for $ the entire time you are there, even if paperwork is done. He is a nasty, nasty hateful man. Do NOT go there.  "
987,38508,2.0,"Pure sales, bait and switch:  Initial visit is promising but on subsequent visits was assigned to less helpful chiro on staff.  Physical therapist was inexperienced and unhelpful.  clinic uses the same stim electrodes on every patient which is disgusting.  They rush patients through in large numbers rather than provide individualized care.  Very crowded. "

989,38509,1.0,"My husband and I have been patients of Dr. Ward for over a year.  We find him knowledgeable and friendly.  When he thinks we need a specialist, he provides information on contacting one, and provides medical information to the specialist when requested.  He's cooperative when we need to see him on short notice.  He's always helpful in whatever way possible.  "
990,38509,1.0,Appears very knowledgeable.  Acts promptly.  
991,38510,0.0,"Dr. Weaver is friendly, knowledgeable and has a great bedside mannor. I had lost touch with her after she changed practices, but I found her again.

999,38512,0.0,AMAZING!!!!! Very helpful and provided strategies to use at home. Made my daughter very comfortable and at ease.  
1000,38512,0.0,"Dr. Nadia is wonderful. It took three months before we could get in to see her, but I can honestly say I'm glad we waited. She is direct and to the point, and as long as you follow the suggestions she gives, you will see a change. We noticed changes (for the better) in our 6 year old within 1 1/2 - 2 weeks. All because we listened and done the things she suggested. "
1001,38512,0.0,Dr Nadia is awesome.  Our son would not be where he is right now without her.  She gives us the knowledge and tools to help our son grow up to be the best he can be.  We wouldn't know what to do without Dr Nadia! 
1002,38512,0.0,Dr. Nadia is the best!  She offers much support via phone to parents for any continued questions after meeting w/her little patients.  My daughter is extremely shy &amp; scared of going to the Dr. but she always asks to go back to Dr. Nadia even though we're done w/treatment.  
1003,38512,0.0,My son absolutely loved her and the sessions with her. She is wonderful to work with. 
1004,38512,0.0,Dr. Nadia is very approachable.  She relates well to the children in her care.  She has given us effective tools to manage my child's situation.  She will also talk to the parents about their concersn on the phone.  
1005,38513,1.0,I was misdiagnosed by another infectious disease doctor and was miserable untill my pcp told me about Dr Weinroth. He took me seriously and was concerned for me. After a 10 day treatment with Iv antibiotics I was back to normal. His nurse summer is the best. Always asking me questions every step of the way.  He will be my doctor for life! Highly recommend Dr Weinroth!! 
1006,38514,2.0,Wonderful listener and helpful during our family sessions. 
1007,38515,1.0,"Dr. Weber has been our primary ped for 5.5 years now and he's excellent. We've run into him in public and he's approached us to say hi, remembering the kids by name, which is impressive for a practice the size of the one to which he belongs. He caught our son's heart defect at an early age when no other pediatrician had, and referred us to an excellent pediatric cardiologist. During that time he called us often to be sure we were okay, if we had any questions or needed help from him. He's got young kids of his own, so he practices what he preaches. We can't say enough good things about Dr. Weber, and our boys love him and trust him.  "
1008,38516,1.0,"The staff is the rudest staff I have ever encountered.Dr Wallingford was not a great help to me.He did do a lot of tests but didnt explain to me any of the results.He gave me a diet,told me to lose weight and gave me vicodin for pain.WHich didnt help as much as I would have thought. Every time I went in there he didnt seem to remember who I was.The last time I went his staff was so rude I decided I didnt have to take such treatment and never went back.Also ALWAYS get a receipt for payment because even tho yu cant go in to see him until they get your money 98% of the time they tell you that you owe them money for earlier visit.ANNOYING. Also,I got my records from them and the last page of them was someone elses records! "
1009,38516,1.0,I agree Dr. Wallingford is very knowledgeable and helpful but his staff leaves a lot to be desired. The other person that talked about phone equiette was correct. I was standing there to check out and they were carrying on a personal conversation for about 3-5 mins. as I stood there to pay out. They also don't keep up with the payments records very well. 
1010,38516,1.0,Dr. Wallingford is extremely thorough and one of the most knowledgeable doctors I have met. He goes out of his way to try and figure out what is going on with your body. He spent several hours with me going over blood and lab tests and trying to make some sense of what other doctors cant figure out. He is one of a kind or maybe he is from a time when doctors acted differently. Either way - heis extremely kind and caring.  
1011,38516,1.0,"I tried to make an appointment and the staff on the phone was very rude and unprofessional. example: having another conversation with people in the office while on the phone w/ me, putting the phone down not on hold while staff went to get my referral all the while discussing w/ a patient in the office about their visit so that I could hear, getting back on the phone with me while continuing her conversation with others and laughing for at least a minute,when I asked the lady on the phone if she was laughing at me she got very rude and said &quot;I'm talking to somebody else&quot;, and refusing to tell me when an appointment was available for me until I gave her a list of personal information.  The Dr may be competent but his staff did not present in any professional manner at all which makes me question how I will be treated in the office. As a medical professional I find the way I was treated disturbing. "
1012,38516,1.0,"Dr. Wallingford is one of the most knowledgeable and thorough doctors I've ever been to. He may be a &quot;senior citizen,&quot; but he's sharp as a tack. If you ask him a question about anything medical, he knows the answer and will explain it to you completely. Now, he is business-like, and some people think he's a little gruff, but he's really not.  He's a true gentleman and there aren't many like him.  "
1013,38517,0.0,My son was one of Dr. Ronda's first patients when she came to our area.   I have always received the highest quality care and continue to recommend her to anyone looking for a great pediatrician! 
1014,38518,1.0,Im 18 weeks pregnant and have seen dr wasserman and his nurse wilma plenty of times and they are both very pleasant and have.passion for what they do! Dr wasserman kinda gives you that dad feeling like hes watching over you and going to keep you safe..wilma is awesome too!! I was worried about drs being judgemental and not acceptong me with out insurance but otmc has been great for me! Im very thankfull to have such support and receive amazing &quot;bed side manor&quot; 
1015,38518,1.0,"I cannot assess this OBGYN. When I called his Williamsburg office to make an appointment, the receptionist asked me if I were pregnant. Then she put me on hold for about five minutes, returned to the line and again asked if I were pregnant. The she asked what type of insurance I had, and before I could answer, she asked &quot;is it thru ya work&#63; we don take that insurance. &quot; "
1016,38519,0.0,"You are never able to speak with a doctor when you have questions and the nurses will only tell you to go to Labor and Delivery, where you will sent home because you didn't need to be there.  The blood pressure cuffs are all suited to &quot;large adult&quot; so the readings are inaccurate if you're smaller and consequently my dangerously high blood pressure was missed (170/110).  I went into the office with contractions at 24 weeks and was sent home and told nobody could see me.  This is a dangerously incompetant office. "
1017,38519,0.0,"I just LOVE Dr. Walker &amp; Julie Weathers!! They are an awesome team. They took such good care of me during all 3 of my pregnancies. Dr. Walker takes the time to answer questions and make sure you're comfortable, he doesn't rush through anything and he is always pleasant. Julie is the same way, she's so down to earth and I feel at ease whenever I see her. This is a very professional duo and I will forever be a patient. "
1018,38519,0.0,"I just had my 2nd baby delivered with Dr. Walker and Julie. I won't go into details, but they were amazing, as always. They 'really' care. Their staff is a reflection on the doctors and nurses and how they see their patients. Just schedule a single appointment with him and you'll see why he's rated so positively. And Julie is amazing as well. It's great he has her on-staff! And the reason they aren't always punctual 100% is because people like me go into labor unexpectedly during the day and they show up immediately to ensure they deliver the baby, just as you would expect them to do for you.  We &lt;3 them! "
1019,38519,0.0,My daughter just had her first baby. During the last month of her pregnancy she experienced some complications and Dr. Walker and Julie were remarkable. I could not have asked for better care for my daughter and grandson. 
1020,38519,0.0,I have been seeing Dr. Walker for a few years.  He has delivered my children and he is a great doctor.  He listens and answers your questions.  The staff has always been very nice too.  Highly recommend!! 
1021,38519,0.0,"I am currently pregnant with my first child and a patient of Dr. Walker's.  I chose to see Dr. Walker after a terrible experience at my first pre-natal appt. with a large OB/GYN group in Fredericksburg.  Although the former was a &quot;group&quot; and I could have picked a different Dr. to continue my care with, my husband and I were so disgusted with the treatment I received by the physician that I saw I wanted nothing more to do with the group itself.  Another Dr. of mine referred me to Dr. Walker after learning of my previous experience and I have received nothing but the BEST of care from him, my nurse and the mid-wife Julie.  The office is warm and inviting.  Dr. Walker always takes the time to answer any and all questions that I have.  I never feel rushed or unimportant.  I believe he genuinely cares about my total care and my family's well being.  I am so glad that I switched to him. "
1022,38519,0.0, 
1023,38520,1.0,Only cares about himself and not people who are sick. NEVER should have gotten his medical license back.  
1024,38520,1.0,"As long-time patients of Dr. Ward, when he announced he was giving up his private practice to practice in several local nursing homes, I and my family were distressed!  To us, he had always been the knowledgeable and respected family physician that we had been seeing for at least twenty years.   To hear his integrity questioned on a local newscast last night (10/09/09) was  unconscionable.  It was as though Roanoke Channel 7 news could not find information on the criminal involved in their story so they communicated personal information on Dr. Ward who was the victim in this story.  "
1025,38520,1.0,"To bad there aren't more Dr.'s like Dr. Ward...He is a very caring, knowledgeable Dr.  If he doesn't think he knows the answer, he will refer you to someone else for 2nd opinion.  He spends time with you and always listens......very kind........  "
1026,38520,1.0, 
1027,38521,1.0,"Very good doctor.  My wife refusues to see anyone else.  There was a small medical billing hiccup once, but that seems to have been resolved afetr I wrote the good doctor a personal letter.  "
1028,38521,1.0,He is a very caring Doctor who takes his time with his patients and listens to their concerns. 
1029,38521,1.0,He is the best doctor I have ever seen. He is exremely caring. I trust him with all my healthcare needs.  
1030,38521,1.0,"DR WEAVER IS THE KINDEST GENTLEMAN I HAVE EVER BEEN TOO. HE HAS A GENUINE CONCERN FOR HIS PATIENTS.  HE IS ON THE TARGET WITH MY MEDICINE AND DIAGNOSIS, SO WELL, I WOULD HAVE A HARD TIME GOING TO ANOTHER DR AND TRUSTING THEM "

1032,38522,0.0,"Unlike all the other reviewers I found Dr Walford the single best doctor my family had ever seen. She went over and above for us. I was having a pre-op assessment and she recognised that my husband had serious health issues. She invested a lot of time working with him and this has changed our lives so much for the better. Additionally, when in recovery after surgery she was kind enough to care for our toddler so my husband could visit me and then when checking herself did a thorough run through of all the medication and care that I was being given at Cedars Sinai (LA) as I had been in recovery for 7 hours. When it was time for us to leave LA our single biggest regret was leaving Dr Walford. Our experience was only of her as a consummate professional with a thoroughly caring approach toward out care.  "
1033,38522,0.0,"I saw Dr. Walford at Alexandria Primary Care Associates.  She was dismissive, rude, and showed little patience for the two questions I asked her.  I have always had a good experience with this practice, and was very taken aback by how she treated me.  If you go to this practice, AVOID seeing her.  "
1034,38522,0.0,"Dr. Walford was angry, hostile, and judgmental. She humiliated, insulted, and chastised me. I went to Alexandria Primary Care Associates to establish myself as a new patient and to discuss concerns about my thyroid and possible diabetes. Apparently, Dr. Walford did not agree with the medication that my previous provider had prescribed and she proceeded to her irrational anger out on ME. I have NEVER seen a health care provider behave so unprofessionally. I can't believe she is in practice. She made sure to let me know that I wasted her time.  "
1035,38522,0.0,"Tanyech Walford does NOT deserve the M.D. after her name, which she believes stands for G.O.D. She is never on time, she has poor patient care and she feels she is above everyone she comes into contact with (doctors, patients, public). If you want a &quot;doctor&quot; to put a band-aid on your illness and call it a day, she's your gal. If you want a &quot;doctor&quot; that makes you wait 2 hours and somehow directs the hostility towards YOU, she's your gal. If you want a &quot;doctor&quot; to not give a damn about your well-being, she is DEFINITELY your gal. This doctor does NOT deserve to be in practice. Her patients are better off in the gutter than under her care. Good riddens. "
1036,38522,0.0,"My long-time GP stopped taking my insurance & I was referred (by a friend of a friend) to Dr. Walford.  I agree with everything the other person said about her.  She seems indifferent, has NO bedside manner & seems to think within the box.  You simply don't get the feeling that she's all that concerned about you!  Awful.  And, it seems like she pays her front office staff minumum wage.  They are extremely unhelpful & not very intelligent.  I won't go back.  "
1037,38522,0.0,This doctor seemed impatient in dealing with me. I have never felt as though I am well or even normal. It is very difficult to get in touch with her or for her to return calls. 
1038,38523,1.0,"Does not return his patient's calls. Nurse advised he does not have time to talk to patients over the phone. Nurse also advised (per the doctor), if I have a concern or question - write a letter. Once he receives it, he will then call back.  How professional is that&#63; "
1039,38524,0.0,"Dr Walia and her assistant, Taylor, are both absolutely wonderful.  I love going there and getting great advice and outstanding service.  I have utilized their services for cosmetic, as well as strictly medical concerns.  They really are the &quot;best&quot; in the the business, because they are skilled a the latest treatments, techniques, and medications. I rated them as a &quot;5&quot; on this website, but they really deserve a rating of 1000+, and I am a tough judge.  Please know you are in very good hands when treated by Dr Walia. "
1040,38524,0.0,"Dr. Walia recently joined Dermatology Assoc of McLean, she is such a great addition. She has done a few laser treatments on me. My skin has never looked better. She and her assistant Taylor are such a great team together. I have even recommended my mother to see her. I look forward to her services for years to come. "
1041,38524,0.0,"Dr. Walia is a great addition to the Mclean practice I have been using for years. Her expertise with laser procedures has really helped with treating a number of my ongoing skin issues. Highly reccomend, my skin has never looked better. :) "
1042,38524,0.0,I have been going to Dr. Walia for some time.  I have always had impeccable service.  She always takes the time to answer questions and concerns.  I highly recommend her. 
1043,38524,0.0,"I get there early and when I go in she makes me wait an extra 20 minutes in her office for her. Finally, her assistant comes in and wipes my cheeks with one swipe using a wet tissue! Then when Walia finally comes in she tells me my treatment is different then what I expected. I told her I wanted my whole face lasered in the initial appointment. I go in and now she says she will only laser my cheeks and increases the pay from $350 to $600! On top of that she literally stayed in the office for 5 minutes before storming out saying talking about how finances made her uncomfortable! WHAT THE F!!! I just want to know my options. If anything I was the one uncomfortable. The laser machine was dusty with used napkins and open lotions bottles on it. The doctor herself was wearing a black mini skirt with fishnet leggings UNPROFESSIONAL! and her attitude and tone was anything but helpful.  I HATE HER! She's disgusting and a poor excuse for a doctor Impatient, unhelpful, and inconsiderate! "
1044,38524,0.0,She is a kind and caring professional who took the time to answer all of my questions. 
1045,38524,0.0,"she rushed me out of the room - maybe if I had asked more questions about cosmetic moneymaking things, she would have been nicer and spent time with me.  I don't have the kind of money that makes this doctor care "
1046,38524,0.0,"I have been a patient of Dr. Walia for a number of years.  Dr. Walia is certainly an expert in her field.  She listens to what my desired results/expectations are and gives good medical advice on treatment.  In addition to being highly professional, Dr. Walia is thoughtful and considerate.  I have always been delighted with the outcome.  High praises! "

1052,38527,0.0,"My mom, husband and myself have been a patient of Dr. Xia since 2007. She is a great dentist. Her hygienist is quick with the teeth cleaning but thorough- exactly what we need. Prior to seeing her I went to many different dentists- all that stated I had 10-15 fillings needed. I had never prior ever had a cavity (even as a youth)- of course, I thought this was strange. I went to see her. She said, she only thought one needed to actually be filled. She said some dentists believe in drilling the good tooth away to get to the bad. This was not her philosophy. It has been 5 years now and no trouble. I am so thankful i fount a great, honest dentist. Personally, I am surprised by any negative reviews. There is no wait time, the office manager does a great job, and Dr. Xia is great. When I needed the filling I was afraid even of novokaine  and she explained the entire process to me- instead of just blowing me off like a lot of Drs would.  For me an my entire family she has been the best dentist "
1053,38527,0.0,"I had my regular teeth cleaning appointment with Dr. Xia.  It took only the staff 20 minutes for the cleaning and the job was aweful.  I went to another dentist 2 months later, the new doctor was surprised that I had my teeth clean two months ago, becuase a lot of teeth were not cleaned by Dr. Xia's office.  "
1054,38527,0.0,"I don't know why my comment and rating on this doctor got deleted. I will keep posting it until my voice and truth got revealed. The doctor is awful. She charged me over $8,000 cash after my insurance company coverage, yes more than eight thousand dollars for teeth planting. After I had my teeth planting, I told her that the fake teeth were not in the right positions. Her answer was there will not ever being right position. I thought that will be the end of my nightmare with Dr. Xia. No, not yet, less than 12 months, my fake tooth was broken. So I went back to her. She was accusing me that I did not pay attention what I ate and she wanted to charge me again for teeth planting. I am in the process of filing lawsuit against her. I have all the evidence and payment I paid her. I wish I can post my bills on this website and pictures of my teeth. Please let the truth gets heard.  "
1055,38527,0.0,"She was great! I was very nervous about my kids being scared. She explained everything to them. She showed them everything before putting it into their mouths.  Their front room had a tv which they will turn to kid shows when you walk in with your kids. They also have a large fish tank with almost all the fish from Finding Nemo. The office is very clean. They have lots of high tech stuff that I've never seen before. At the end, my one daughter said that we should come back everyday. "
1056,38527,0.0,"I finally found Dr. Xia as the best dentist that I would highly recommend to you all. All my family members have been seeing her for the past two years including my six years and three years old. She has done my little one's three teeth fillings all at once without tearing or screaming. Besides her superb dental skills and special care, she is very accommodating for all different kinds of patients' needs. Her greatest sense of humor and beautiful brand-new office settings will bring you a very special dental visit experience. "
1057,38527,0.0,She is very nice and knowledgeable and explains clearly the diagnosis and treatment in lay person's terms. She treated my gum disease with obvious improvement. Her clinic is well equipped and spotless clean.

1059,38529,1.0,"I believe Dr. Ahn was very deceptive.  At first, he made me feel great; so energetic and healthy!  After I believed in him, I never felt as good again.

1061,38531,2.0,"Extremely knowledgable, extraordinarily helpful.  "
1062,38531,2.0,did not give useful recommendations for my child. 
1063,38533,0.0,"At the time I picked my doctor she was the only one in my area that was taking new patients. All I know from my experience is she treats me as if I am not a human being that has problems and needs her to take good care of me and she makes me sign a behaverial contract and it to me is  like a threat and really hurts me and she does not really listen to me and what I have to say. I am a Chronic Pain patient and she plays with my mind and when it comes to refilling my pain medicine she gives me what she thinks I need, not what I usually take. I need to function and not just lay around and not be active for the pain is so severe. She is always using the state as the reason I can only have what she gives me and I called the state and I was told as long as I have a medical reason of which I do, there is no restriction. I have so much to say and 1000 words limited is not going to give me the space to give all the specifics that need to added to this complaint.I have many health problems.  "

1074,38535,1.0,My family has seen DR Altman for several years now. His staff is wonderful and are great with my kids. Dr Altman and his staff care about you and your experience. As a fearful dental patient he put me at ease and even called to check on me once after having a dental procedure!

1076,38535,1.0,My family has been going to Dr. Altman's office for decades.  He provides excellent services and appears to always have state of the art equipment and techniques.  Hygientists have been consistantly superb.  
1077,38536,1.0,Great doctor with a very helpful staff. He was especially knowledeable about diseases and genetic conditions that may affect people of Indian subcontinent.  
1078,38536,1.0,I will recommend this doctor to who need medical care . 
1079,38536,1.0,Most arrogant attitude. Has no regard for human feelings and most unprofessional behavior. Meeting him was a nightmare.  
1080,38536,1.0,"Dr.Tariq was an extremly unhelpful doctor. He did not ask me any questions about my condition, did nothing to diagnose the problem and provided no useful information at all. He actually had the nerve to tell me to lie to my employer about my condition so that I don't get fired. The whole visit was a big waste of time. His staff is very unprofessional too. Avoid this doctor at all costs.  "
1081,38536,1.0,didn't even say hello when he walked in and was rude when he did talk.  had a lot of trouble taking blood.  
1082,38536,1.0, 
1083,38537,1.0,very knowledgable and helpful. we had a good experience with this md 
1084,38537,1.0,"This physician is unprofessional and puts his ego ahead of the welfare of his patients. I would not recommend him for ANY TYPE of medical care. Run away, don't walk, if you have to have this doctor(&#63;&#63;) on your treatment team.  "
1085,38538,2.0,"Beautiful office and very pleasant office staff. First appointment patients must watch a video re: chiropractic care, then spend lots of time waiting while doctor enters info into computer. Personal comments were made that crossed the professional line. Patients are encouraged to visit many times/week. Money seems to be the bottom line here. "
1086,38539,0.0,"I have been with this doctor for many years now and I would recomend that if you want a very, very good doctor, look no further than her.                    dlrv1947@yahoo. com "
1087,38539,0.0,"I love Dr. Lila Aflatooni.  She is kind, knowledgeable, and very interested in working to keep you well.  she ensures that all your test results are fully explained to you (by her) and she talks to you personally.  Refills are called in on time.  Appointments are available when you need them.  Her staff is great.  "
1088,38539,0.0,Had no care or concern over my serious health issuses. Her receptionist is very snotty and unhelpful. The doctor herself has a god complex and is unprofessional. I would not recommend her to my worst enemy! I hope people will go to her of they are sick and don't want to get help or want to sit around waiting to get blood tests/ reports when you need them the most! 
1089,38539,0.0,very rude and doe not take true issues like pain seriously 
1090,38539,0.0,. wonderful practice 
1091,38540,1.0,Had a needle core biopsy done by this Dr. and he didn't inform me that the specimen had sat in the pathology dept.for 2 days and then the report showed poorly perserved specimen and an inflammation.  Would have been nice to have been informed that test should have been repeated and my insuranse was charged by Dr. &amp; hospital for their mistake. 
1092,38541,0.0,"Last October I went to see this doctor for the first time and I brought my husband along.  We both felt that she didn't really listed to my concerns and she was very short.  I was sent off to take some ultrasounds and the ultrasounds came back not showing anything so the doctor didn't do anything for me.  I called back because my problem didn't go away and I started to have further complications.  Once again, she was completely unhelpful and told me I didn't need to come in and see her.  A month and a half went by and I was still having problems.  This time I went to a different doctor.  Right off the bat he though he knew what was wrong with me and he did the tests to confirm it.  Sure enough, I had a very common disease that she failed to diagnose.  Her failure to diagnose my problem could make it so I can never have kids.  Even the doctor who I saw for the second opinion was suprised that she didn't know what was wrong in the first place since it is a fairly common disease. "
1093,38542,0.0,"When it was discovered that I had a tumor, she told me that she'd never dealt with this and didn't know what to do.  She's a traditionally (allopathically) training doctor as well as trained in naturophy.  I was beyond dismayed at this kind of irresponsible response.  She is also haughty and judgmental. "
1094,38544,1.0,"Dr.Dale Alsager is a caring, compassionate doctor that really cares about this patients and will do everything he can to improve thier lives. He halped me live a comfortable life and is still today my friend and someone I can call when I need help. I would reccommend him to anyone. He and his wife Better are wonderful people. I rated him because there is no other doctor out there like him. "
1095,38545,1.0,"My experience as a former patient of Dr. David Aboulafia was not good. I felt that he lacked sufficient listening skills and as a result of his poor doctor/patient communication skills, I was sent to the hospital where I suffered Congestive Hart Failure Exacerbation.  "
1096,38546,2.0,. Frustrated 
1097,38547,0.0,"Dr. Ahart has a very limited worldview and does not accept parents that have a different ideology than her.  For example, I breastfed my child until he was two--our choice. She was very negative regarding breastfeeding and told me formula is actually superior after 6 mos. of age. Breastfeeding is a woman's (and child's) choice, and should be encouraged by the doctor.  She also was critical of limiting screentime (t.v., computer, etc.) because, as she said, that's the future and parents should want their children to function in society well.  I believe children should be encouraged to develop their own imaginations...but I understand that others may see that differently.  I just was surprised to have a alarmed face made at me when I told her &quot;thank you for your suggestions, but we have traditional values&quot;. I take my child to the doctor for medical treatment, not parenting advice--but am not mad if I get advice, just shocked when judged so easily. She was very scary to my boy as well.  "
1098,38547,0.0,"Dr. Ahart is the best...she takes no crap off the kids, hence the complaints from the crybaby parents about her bedside manner.  Sure you have to wait sometimes because she takes her time with her patients, but, she takes the same amount time with your kids, so it all evens out.  She loves my daughters and they love her.  I won't take them to anyone else.  "
1099,38547,0.0,"Son was 7 or 8 at the time (he's 17 now).  She wanted to check his testicles.  Just pulled down his pants w/o telling him why she was doing it.  He was upset and scared. I was angry!  Another time, he had a stiff neck, so she twisted it quickly.  He screamed out in pain.  Has had trouble with neck ever since.  I find her overbearing,egotistical, and with no beside manner what-so-ever. "
1100,38547,0.0,"She's a little stern, and sometimes wait times are long, but overall Dr. Ahart is an amazing doctor. Her staff are nice and the facility is spotless. I wouldn't go to anyone else. "

1106,38547,0.0,This dr has a very bad bed side mannor and is not very kind. She is a control freak.

1108,38549,1.0,"Dr Alberda Is amazing! I call him the baby whisperer. He is patient, kind and always answers all my questions. I know that his truly wants the best for my children and he will be their pediatrician untill they turn 18! "
1109,38550,1.0,"Dr. Alan has been my regular eye doctor for over fifteen years. I visit his office yearly for an annual exam and on occasion for other eye issues. He is soft spoken and fairly reserved yet will readily and thoughtfully answer questions, discuss any problems, and give his recommendations as needed. I have been very happy with his care. In my opinion he is a first rate provider and sensitive to his patients' concerns. I've always found the office staff to be very helpful and kind both on the phone and when at appointments.  "
1110,38550,1.0,"Dr Alan is Very knowledgeable, was willing to explain and answer all my questions. At the end of my appointment, Dr Alan walked me out to the front office. Staff is excellent. Very friendly and helpful office.  "
1111,38550,1.0,"Dr. Alan was rude to me, brusque and did not explain procedures. In giving an eye examination, he started to shove a machine up to my eyeball without explaining what he was doing. He then left the examination room without saying goodbye. Horrid bedside manners. "
1112,38550,1.0,"Dr. Alan performed surgery for my cataracts twice and each time was I comfortable in him doing so. He always leaves a great impression as he is indeed nice, helpful and knowledgeable in his practice. I highly recommend him when it comes to your eyes.  "
1113,38551,0.0,"She is an excellent and knowledgeable doctor. I hate having internal exams and she is the only one that i didn't experience pain or discomfort at all. She always takes time to answer any questions or concerns that I have. She is very straight forward, honest and will tell you what to expect whether its something you want to hear or not.  "
1114,38551,0.0,"Was consistently 30-45 min late and called me fat when I wasnt, front desk staff rude.  Switched doctors mid pregnancy "
1115,38551,0.0,"Dr. Albretch is a very good doctor. I would recommend her to anyone. I had her as my OBGYN with baby girl. She is very knowledgeable and takes her time to make sure that all your questions are answered. She is a very straight to the point kind of doctor, That is what I need, IF you are the type of person that like be told &quot;what you want to hear&quot; then she is not the doctor for you. She takes her roll as a MD very seriously and is a great physician! "
1116,38551,0.0,"Dr. Albrecht is a very good doctor...she has a wonderful bedside manner, is knowledgeable, personable and easy to talk to. I highly recommend her.  "
1117,38551,0.0,She is caring and personable.  Would recommend her to anyone! 
1118,38551,0.0,"I loved having Albrecht as my doctor, She was there for me every step of the way. She was very personable. She knew exactly what she was doing. I was also very lucky to have her deliver my baby girl. When my husband and I decide to have another baby I will most definatly be requesting Albrecht as my doctor.  "
1119,38551,0.0,"This woman scolded me, made unacceptable comments to me, not to mention, she was extremely physically rough with me. She gave me a pelvic exam, and I have had many, this one was the most painful ever. She shoved her arm inside of me, and used my stomach as leverage. When she was done, I was bleeding, and didn't stop bleeding for almost 24 hours. I thought I was having a miscarriage. Some doctors forget that they are working with human beings who have feelings and emotions. When you are a doctor, it is not just a job, you have someone's life in your hands, and I believe you should be compassionate and understanding.      I do not recommend Dr. Albrecht to anyone, I think she has a lot to learn about people before she could be a decent doctor! "
1120,38551,0.0, 
1121,38552,0.0,"I was Dr. Abbott's patient for about 1 year. I tolerated he and his nurses' poor behavior until I could take no more. He would always enter the exam room yawning! Then he would seem bored. His MA was always rude to us. She was the rudest red head I have ever met! Oh, and Dr. Abbott also flat out lied to me! ( I found this out by going to one of his collegues)Only one time did he do a brief physical exam. I felt that he did not try to help resolve my issues. I am now seeing someone else in this clinic and am very satisfied! I would NOT recommend him to anyone.  "
1122,38552,0.0,"Dr. Abbott has been my PCP for about 4 years now.  I would recommend him to anyone.  He's very kind and patient, and works with me to give me what I need. "
1123,38552,0.0,. helped with muscle spams in my back by the shoulder blade by giving me a pill to take 3 times a day 
1124,38553,1.0,"Too much to put here, but he is arrogant, rude to patients and will talk down to you. He uses intimidation to get his point across. He will lecture you until you break if you are ever late. See someone else, even if he is a great surgeon, there are other great surgeons that can help you.  "
1125,38554,1.0, 
1126,38554,1.0,"I have had two surgerical procedures performed by Dr. Allegra and both end products were absolutely amazing.  Childbirth did a lot of damage to my body and he was able to help significantly.  The staff is nice and the anesthetiologist was amazing.  I've never come in and out of surger that easily before.  When I've gotten surgery at a public hospital you are one of many, here you feel like you are their only surgery in progress and get specialized attention. "
1127,38554,1.0,Very caring and knowledgeable.  First class organization.   Amazing procedure.  Made me be able to wear normal clothes again. 
1128,38554,1.0,"Felt comfortable with staff, surroundings, and procedure. But the outcome was disappointing. Hearing decrease and pain continued.Second opinion from another doctor detected collasped ear drum,needed replacement prothesis and ear tubes and remove cholesteatoma.Get a second opinion before surgery.  "
1129,38554,1.0,"They can't bill correctly.  They sent me a very confusing bill, when I asked them to explain it because it appeared they billed me for the same things 2x they couldn't.  I am not happy with them at all.  "
1130,38554,1.0,"I found Dr. Allegra professional, caring and extremely knowledgeable. I would recommend him to my family and friends. He has performed a number of procedures from snoring to a brow lift and I have been extremely happy with all the results. "
1131,38554,1.0,Dr. Allergra recommended Somaplasty to remove my sleep apenea and snoring.  It never worked! I still have my sleep apnea and I snore louded than before. 
1132,38554,1.0,"2 years ago,I received a diagnosis on a thyroid nodule that it was indicative of papillary carcinoma.It was a scary time for me.I was referred to Dr. Allegra for a thyroidectomy.I felt peace with him immediately.  He was confident,but not overly so, and was compassionate and kind.The day of the surgery went exactly as he'd said it would.The surgery was complete and I headed home.He'd told me that I may not need more than ibuprofen-he was right.There was very minimal pain-a little discomfort.What most amazed me, though, was the almost absence of a scar. Within 6 months, you could see only the slightest scar.Now,people have to be told that there is a scar to see it-and, even then,it requires squinting.Dr. Allegra is the total package when it comes to doctors. He's caring, he's confident, and he's very skilled.  I'm so thankful that he is the doctor that I was referred to-I couldn't have asked for a more positive experience in the midst of such a difficult situation.  "
1133,38554,1.0,"I had the somnoplasty procedure...my snoring was medium at best and bothered my wife, so I went with the procedure.  After proclaiming a high 90's% success rate, I plopped down my money.  After 4 procedures, plus removal of my uvula, I had virtually no change in my snoring.  I asked for my money back, but nope.  By the way,  they say somnoplasty is virtually a pain free procedure.  It wasn't the case with me.   I also swelled up big time and could hardly sleep after the first treatment.  With no fix from Dr. Alegra, I  ended up going to my dentist who suggested a custom mouth piece to keep the lower jaw from sliding back.  Guess what.  It worked.  Less money; less pain. "
1134,38554,1.0,Dr Allegra is very knowledgeable and courteous with his staff and patients.  I have seen him a few times for medical issues and have always been satisfied with his level of professionalism.  
1135,38554,1.0,"It's very sad that a doctor would perform unnecessary surgery, then be uncaring about the unsatisfactory outcome. I wish I would have just said 'No'. I saw this doctor on a TV news health segament (after my surgery), I couldn't believe it was the same man! On tv he seemed so caring, so 'involved'. It is all about the $money$. It usually is. FIRST DO NO HARM. "
1136,38554,1.0,"Dr. Allegra was only interested in signing my child up for surgery.  Unnecessary surgergy.  He is only about money and not about care.  They lost my paperwork so billing was messed up.  On the day of my appointment I waited almost one hour (I was on time, they were late) with a sick 9 year old.   AVOID THIS DOC! "
1137,38554,1.0,. knowledgeable 
1138,38555,1.0,"I have a nerve stimulator that was implanted in my body incorrectly, causing me extreme pain. I went to Dr. Allen and he refused to help me. He was uncaring, rude, and did not care at all that I was in virually unbearalbe pain. This after his nurse scheduler said he would help me as he had helped other patients, and that he handled other cases just like mine. At the conclusion of my appointment, he said he was referring me to their pain specialist, then his nurse called two days later and said he would not help. He could have told me this at, or before my appointment, and not held out hope that he would help me, only to have one of his employees turn me down. People in pain need help now, not empty promises. I would never treat anyone with the lack of respect and caring that I was shown. Shame on you Dr. Allen! "
1139,38556,1.0,Dr. Aginsky is extremely helpful and very nice. He really ties to find out what you need/want. I have a rare eye disease and he has helped me feel a lot more comfortable with my visual future. Extremely knowledgeable. 
1140,38556,1.0,"Had Excellent bedside manner. Explained tests as he did them, my entire family was very pleased! "
1141,38557,2.0,"The worse doctor I've ever seen.  Non-caring, doesn't explain, has no compassion for patients. "
1142,38558,1.0,"Dr. Albert and his staff are super friendly, very helpful with insurance and do GREAT work. They have new machines with the latest technology and my mouth and my kids' mouths are never sore after we have dental work done. We love Dr.  Albert and his staff! "
1143,38559,1.0,"Dr. Greg is very gentle and kind. I had a lot of crowns, and he makes it really easy for me to go in and have them...  I've been to a lot of dentist's and he is my favorite! "
1144,38560,2.0,unacceptable treatment from a person who is supposed to be supportive. 
1145,38560,2.0,Quite insensitive &amp; unprofessional.I have no doubt there are better therapists in town. Don't waste your time. 
1146,38561,1.0,"Dr. Leonard is great, Finally after 20 yrs of hand out pain Dr. he knows what he is doing and understands my conditions.  He is kind and so are his staff members "
1147,38561,1.0,He is a very compassionate person and listens to you. He gave me a treatment plan and left it up to me if it made improvement to continue or not to. His staff is very good with people and caring. The care was very professional and first class! We need more good doctors with a sense of humor also! I believe he has patients concerns in mind first and not to run a stressed office as we often see.  
1148,38561,1.0,This is the only Dr. that has helped me with my problems.  I went to approx. 15 different Dr's before I was sent to him.  Thank GOD! 
1149,38561,1.0,Doesn't listen know's everything he thinks. Only will prescribe methidone for pain.  
1150,38561,1.0,"I have never had a Doctor before that actually would take the time to talk to you, explain something, and actually sincerely wanted to help, but at the same time get to know about you, and work with you. I had been to the UW Pain clinic, and they would just give me an RX for pain pills, after numerous mis-diagnosises from some of the top facility's in Washington, I stumbled across Dr. Albert, by my second visit I had the correct diagnosis, and he's been my Doctor since, that was at least 10 years ago. He also has a kind and caring staff, and when my 15 and a half year old daughter passed away last year I was at a loss, I knew that the Doc had a rule that he did not take calls, but he did that day, because he cares about his patients.  "
1151,38561,1.0,"Dr. Albert is compassionate, understanding, and very knowledgable in the area of pain management. He will do his best to help a patient manage pain. If you are a drug seeker do not even make an appointment with Dr. Albert as he is very cautious with pain medicines. Although if you have legitimate pain he will do whatever he can to improve the quality of life for his patients. He is also a internal medicine Dr. And handles problems for people in general medicine.  "
1152,38562,1.0,Very skilled doctor. He is quick because of his large knowledge base. I couldn't be happier with him 
1153,38562,1.0,"He knows what he's doing and will make time when I bring up additional concerns.  What other's have been describing here as being hurried is most likely the fact that they present with a pretty straight forward situation, so Dr. Adams gives a straight forward answer.  If you take ownership for your own health, and voice any concerns you may not have had answered, Dr. Adams will make time.  My guess is that, when he doesn't spend a lot of time with me, it's b/c he needs to make up for the guy he spent extra time with, and if I don't need a lot of chit chat or converastion around the obvious, he's not going to dwell.  That works for me, but maybe not for everyone.  BTW, he's always been right so far.  "
1154,38562,1.0,"Excellent doc...  short and to the point and old school, but there is nothing wrong with that much better at diagnosing than the prev 2 docs I saw "
1155,38562,1.0,I was thorougly impressed with how attentive and helpful Dr. Adams was.  He spent 45 min with his initial examination.  He even spent the time to take 2 pages of history notes!!!  He actually listened to my concerns and didn't just write a prescription for pain meds and usher me out (which previous doctors have done.)  I'm confident that he will do everything in his power to track down an accurate diagnosis.  
1156,38562,1.0,"I was referred to Dr. Adams and agree with another rating as far as he did not listen, nor spend time with you. He is very quick to just get you out.  I felt as though he really did not want me as a patient and passed me off after only 3 visits.  Charged me for writing a prescription!!!!Would not recommend nor will I be returning. Very little understanding when it comes to pain.  "
1157,38562,1.0,"GREAT doctor. Very smart and thorough. I'd recommend him to anyone with sports injuries, really his forte. EXCELLENT doctor.  "
1158,38562,1.0,"I've heard very good things about him, however was not very impressed by his care. Always late, I felt he did not spend enough time listening to me.  "
1159,38562,1.0,"Great doctor, great listener, very thorough and attentive to detail. Yes, he normally referred me to a specialist, but he kept in touch and followed up all the time. A great general practice doc, the old way when doctors had time for their patients.  "

1164,38566,1.0,I used to go to Dr. Martin but he's almost never there anymore.  Dr. A is very caring and knowledgeable. 
1165,38566,1.0,This doctor seems thorough and is very caring.  A good listener. 
1166,38567,1.0,I've been seeing Dr. Alleman since I was just a baby.  Very knowledgeable and willing to help with anything he can! 
1167,38568,2.0,. wonderful person and great Nurse Practitioner excellent staff 
1168,38569,0.0,Dr Ahmed now works in mount Vernon and is the best dds I've ever had 
1169,38569,0.0,"I went to Dr Ahmed as a new patient on February 3, 2011 based on the referral of a friend. From the time I walked in the door to the time I walked out, I felt like a princes. I was greeted very courteously by the receptionist and was treated promptly. The time taken by the doctor and her staff were unsurpassed by any dentist I have ever gone to. It turns out that I needed some additional treatment and Dr Ahmed was very forthright and professional with my treatment plan. I HAVE NEVER had the positive experience at a dental office the way I did at Dr. Ahmed’s office. HUge Kudos to Dr Ahmed for delivering what he says he will do. You can tell the doctor cares very much about what he does and how he treats people.  "
1170,38570,1.0,"Dr. Allen is a fantastic pediatrician. He listens very well to your questions, then takes the time to explain exactly what is normal and when you should be concerned. We moved out of the immediate area, but continue to see Dr. Allen because we wouldn't want to switch doctors! "
1171,38571,1.0,Dr. Albertini is very knowledgeable and helpful.  His staff is very friendly.   Great doctor! 
1172,38571,1.0,"Dr. Albertini was the worst pediatric i have ever been to. He made us feel stupid when we asked him questions as we should have known the answer and didn't ever answer questions. He was always in a hurry and would try to get us out of the office quickly. His assistant/nurse was so unprofessional and made us feel the same way. After our son was severley injured we gave his assistant 5 questions that we wanted to try to get answers on &amp; she wrote them down. When Dr. Albertini came in the office he never even looked at our questions and concerns. We had to mention the questions again. Even then he didn't even look at the notes the assistant wrote. I have never experienced such poor service before. The only credit i give him is that he did see us on our appointment which is only expected. Other than that I would NEVER recommend this doctor to anyone.  Office was not clean, assistant wore pants w/glidder on the back pockets however that was the least of my worries, overall NOT RECOMMENDED "
1173,38572,1.0,"Dr. Adkins has been a wonderful, caring, and responsive doctor. He has been the family physician to myself and my 6 children, having delivered my youngest three girls. He is thorough, and unlike most doctors I have interacted with, he is completely willing to share his knowledge with you in order to help you understand a diagnosis, illness, virus, etc. We have been so lucky to have had him as our doctor for five years, and I doubt that we will find another like him. I have one son with special needs, and I actually moved my son from a specialty pediatric practice to Dr. Adkins because I feel that Dr. Adkins is more knowledgeable and attentive than the peds. specialist. "
1174,38572,1.0,"Has been the best doctor I've had. He is helping me with my 5th pregnancy and has been the best ob doctor Out of all of them, (different doc for each pregnancy)I haven't delivered yet, so I can't vouch for that part yet, but he is very good at telling you all the options and percentages and explaining different ways to look at the situation when I'm trying to make a decision. He's very supportive of whatever decisions I make too. I also feel he really wants to do what's best and right and not just what the current medical trend is. I feel he does the research, and stays educated with the current research. He seems to not hesitate in taking necessary action too, even if he's busy. I love that he's willing to communicate through email. I hate to keep the other patients waiting, but at the same time, want to ask a lot and email seems a good way to do it. As a note, I have never felt like he looked down on me for being on DSHS medical. It's never seemed like it made a difference.  "
1175,38572,1.0,"1000 characters isnt enough to write how good Dr. Adkins is. He has been my doctor since 2004, delivered both of my boys and I highly recommend him to every one and anyone, regardless of insurance. He's the best doctor for miles and miles and miles. I don't think there's anything he doesn't know. He always takes his time and is very caring. While I was pregnant with my first son and unsure of some things, I knew I could easily get a hold of him by phone or email. My family and I will be his patients as long as he's in this area. "
1176,38572,1.0,"I also had a bad experience with Dr. Adkins and reading the other reviews I now realize it is because our kids are on Medicaid.  He was very rude and condescending.  So yeah, I guess go to this doctor if you have private insurance and don't mind seeing a hypocritical doctor but otherwise avoid.  "
1177,38572,1.0,Dr. Adkins is the most knowledgeable and personable and compassionate primary physician I've ever had.  He has a gift for explaining technical information in understandable terms without being condescending.  He delivered our son via c-section and provided medical care to the whole family in a comprehensive and thorough manner.  I recommend Dr. Adkins without reservation.  
1178,38572,1.0,"Dr. Adkins has been my OB and my children's Ped. I appreciate his optomism and the details with which he justifies his course of action if you ask, which also reassures me that he is well read.  My husband and I deeply appreciated his respectfulness of our wishes when it came to wanting  a natural  labor and delivery of our children.  In an age where prescription medication is very overused, we are glad that he does not prescribe meds for us or our kids unless necessary.  He has always been very upbeat and positive.  We did have an unpleasant visit once where we were unintentionally left waiting for a very long time to hear some results and he went out of his way to make it up to us.  He makes himself very available, always telling us to call or email if we have questions, and he is prompt in replying to emails.  I was on subsidized healthcare during my pregnancies and my children still receive it, and Dr. Adkins has always treated us with professionalism and respect.  "
1179,38572,1.0,Great doctor I have ever had. He is very helpful and full of information. Wont see anyone else but him.  Thanks 
1180,38572,1.0,"Dr. Adkins was a our family doctor for the 3 years we lived in Pullman. He delivered both my girls. As someone who is terrified of going to the doctor, I found Dr. Adkins to be kind, patient, respectful, and extremely knowledgable. We never felt rushed in our appointments and always left feeling well taken care of. Dr. Adkins encourages his patients to email with questions and concerns and almost always responded within 24 hours. My second child was a planned c-section and as we were are getting ready to head into the OR, the nurse commented that I was contracting every 15-20 minutes. Dr. Adkins immediately said &quot;I can call all this off right now if you'd like to try a v-bac.&quot; It's that kind of respect for the patient's wishes, while maintaing medical integrity that made us value him as we did.  "
1181,38572,1.0,"I can't recommend this Dr. enough!  He's wonderful with children, thorough with exams, a great listener, full of knowledge and is always up to date on all new research available. He uses his time wisely and I've never had to wait for more than 10 minutes during an appt. Our whole family loves this doctor.  Our children actually look forward to seeing him for wellness checks. "
1182,38572,1.0,"Being on medicare AND having a baby, Dr Adkins has been nothing but helpful and courteous every time I've seen him.  He's never been rude or judgmental.  Only real complaint is he seems to be in a bit of a hurry at times, but we love him as our obstetrition.  I don't know what these other people are talking about.  "
1183,38572,1.0,"If you're on Medicaid, don't bother seeing Dr. Adkins. This guy is verbally abusive behind closed doors. Mr. Nice Guy outside the exam room, but once that door closes.... He raised his voice at me and he called me a &quot;welfare patient&quot;. Whoever runs that office should schedule a Medicaid patient with him, then put a recorder in the exam room so they can hear for themselves, or at least take what people report about him seriously and discipline or fire him. He should go work in a lab or something, not around people, at least not around people who are on Medicaid. He apparently has no problem with folks who are private pay or have good private insurance, but do you really want to be treated by someone who treats the least of us with such verbal abuse and meanness&#63; This guy is a creep.  "
1184,38572,1.0,Dr. Adkins is an outstanding doctor! He has always been respectful and helpful. He always listens carefully and never makes us feel rushed. 
1185,38572,1.0,". Was not helpful when I had questions about the safety of V-bac, although I told him it was important to me he told me to e-mail them to him because he had other patients waiting "
1186,38572,1.0,"Dr. Adkins has been my doctor for the past 3 years and I could not ask for a better physician. I can e-mail him anytime I have a question and he is always quick to respond. He is knowledgeable about conditions and treatment options and is always thorough in his explanations of procedures and risks etc. He is not arrogant or condescending and I feel like he genuinely cares about me as a patient. He listens to and addresses my concerns in an exquisite manner with an understanding that certain issues, however trivial they may seem, are important to me. He seems to really enjoy what he does and he always greets me with a smile. I have never had such a wonderful doctor. "
1187,38572,1.0,"First saw Adkins a few years ago because my regular MD was unavailable. I have rheumatoid arthritis, and saw him for a few pain killers for a camping trip since sitting on logs and sleeping on the ground can cause me to have a great deal of pain in my affected joints. He verbally humiliated me, gave me the third degree over 6 pain pills I got from an emergency room almost a year previously, and in so many words accused me of being a junkie.  Then wrote the prescription, threw it in my face, and said, &quot;Make 'em last.&quot;  I walked out in tears. Had another run-in with him a few days ago, again because my regular MD was not available. I am stopping smoking and I am eligible for some assistance with the cost of patches. First he called in a prescription for gum, which is not covered. Then he called in a prescription for the patch, but the wrong strength. He managed to screw things up so bad I can't get anything now. Ok, fine. I get the message. I'm on medicaid so I don't deserve to live.  "
1188,38572,1.0,Very Nice Dr but I was told he won't treat long term pain management. 
1189,38572,1.0,"Dr. Adkins Delivered our 2nd baby girl in July 2005 and will be delivering our 3rd in Nov. 2007 He has proven to be very knowledgeable, caring and helpful. I would definately reccomend him! He has a great personality and is always willing to listen. "
1190,38572,1.0,"Dr. Adkins will be delivering our baby girl and he is helpful, knowledgeable, very nice and personable. "
1191,38573,1.0,Best Doc ever! He has been my family doctor for 15+ years now! Always a joy to see him.  
1192,38573,1.0,"Dr. Aguilu is one of the best doctors I've ever had. He cared for my mom and my dad both, and treated both of them with great compassion. When my dad was in the ICU around holiday times, Dr. A still came by on his days off--just because he knew that my family was enduring a particularly difficult time. If I leave a message for him and need to speak with him personally, I know I will hear from him, even if it's long after his office hours are over. "
1193,38573,1.0,"It took my family a long time to find a GOOD doctor, my children are now grown and have their own children. Dr. Aguilu has been our Dr for over 13 years and is very good.  "
1194,38574,0.0,I have been seeing Dr. Kissick for 4 yrs and I feel she is the best Dr. I have ever seen. She truly cares for her patients.

1201,38579,1.0,"I would not go to him again - I had a midface lift and I did not like my result at ALL. Further, I now have scars in my hairline that I detest. I did not have a good experience with the one of the staff either (specifically one woman with dark hair that came in the examining room). I regret the surgery and would never go back there. "
1202,38579,1.0,He made my nose look asymetrical and pinched and wouldn't admit that he made a mistake. He also told me it was a simple procedure but billed me saying that it was complicated and expensive

1207,38583,1.0,Worst doctor we met. He was 1.5hrs late and was answering all his calls. Never followed up on bloodwork he ordered for us and the patient has cancer. He and the hospital will be hearing from our lawyer. 
1208,38584,0.0,"She was a quintessential professional.  That being said, she is also very beautiful. "

1211,38585,1.0,I am not sure why this Dr. is in businesd a s far a sI can tell he dols out pills like candy with little or no proof the patients need them as I belive they all sell there pills for profit..DEA needs to know bout this guy 
1212,38585,1.0,"Seen him for years,don't anymore!Originally it improved my quality of life.In the last year it's been very shoddy.He changed to unprofessional staff.It became almost impossible to contact anyone there.Leave messages(as they never answer the phone)and nobody would call back.I was started on Savella packets 3 times.My pharmacist and i would call to get the prescription,as directed by Dr. Adams,before the packets ran out and could never get a response.My pharmacist finally got tired of leaving messages.Going there began to feel like going to a drug dealer.Pay cash(wouldn't accept insurance),chat a moment and leave w/prescription for pills. The meds did vitally help my condition,but unprofessional.My last appointment was scheduled for Tues. Jan 28,11 which doesn't exist.Numerous calls and messages;i gave up.I ran out of meds i'd been on for 6 years,including meds for depression.Dr.Adams incompetence is harmful to ones wellbeing and health!I since have changed to a professional doctor! "
1213,38585,1.0,"Dr. Adams helped me regain my life, I suffer with chronic low back pain. And before I started seeing him, there were mornings I could barely get out of bed to walk to the bathroom.. He's a wonderful doctor. "
1214,38585,1.0,"Compassionate, understanding, helpful and takes time with patients....And he LISTENS well! All patients are human beings and he &quot;gets&quot; that and treats patients with respect.  "
1215,38586,1.0,This doctor is the best!!!!! My adnoidsd felt awesome!!!! I would totally recommend him!!!!! 
1216,38587,0.0,"I was asking for a different referral from my dr due to these ratings and because there was no other in the area I went to see Dr Ahmadian.  I absolutely love her, she is so wonderful I am truly surprised by these other ratings. She took her time and explained everything to me and was very thorough, I have recommended others to her already. I ask alot of &#63;'s and fax her with others and she took her time to call me and respond to me...not her staff, she followed up with any of my concerns. I had a thyroid nodule, she performed fine needle biopsy ended up inconclusive, referred me to a ENT surgeon and we all decided the best approach was left lobectomy.  Yes I could have waited and gone through more ultrasounds and more biopsies but the end result would have been the same and both Dr gave their opinions and all options and included me in all and the final decision was left up to me.  She is fantastic! "
1217,38587,0.0,"Has her own agenda, not focused on patient care.  Brash and uncaring.  "
1218,38587,0.0,"Very condescending. I have a PhD in Human physiology and hence had a decent understanding of my recently diagnosed lupus/fibromyalgia issue. She dismissed me as being not disciplined enough to exercise. Her report said that all my pain and inflammation was just in my head - a mere perception. She ignored the fact that i was positive for SSA and ANA with whacked out cortisol and DHEA levels. Basically it was a total waste of over $350 for my poor provider Microsoft Premera. I hope she never has to deal with any chronic illness esp., endocrine related. Totally avoid! "
1219,38587,0.0,"the worst doctor I've ever seen! Extremely rude, condesending and no listening skills at all! She should be lucky I haven't initiated litigation against her. She dismissed me as&quot;just being tired&quot; 6 months later I almost died.  Never ever go to her! "
1220,38587,0.0,"I have uncontrolled diabetes.  id not seem to care that my levels were 275-400.  She did not seem to believe anything I was telling her.    Maybe it was something as simple as a language problem, not sure.  There are much better choices-not many but keep looking.  "
1221,38587,0.0,"The doctor is good but her billing staff is awful. They have been submitting claims with the wrong information to my insurance then they send me a bill every month saying that they couldn't verify me and I need to pay a balance. I personally gave them a copy of my insurance card three times after three statements and they still couldn't do it right. They even gave the lab the wrong insurance information, but the lab staff was intelligent enough to correct the mistake after I gave them my correct insurance information. If this doctor would like to keep a busy practice, they she should definitely change her billing staff and have a better billing system.  "
1222,38587,0.0,"Honestly, I can't even imagine what the other reviewers on here are talking about. Dr. Ahmadian is one of the most helpful, professional doctors I've ever had the pleasure of working with. When I was diagnosed with a thyroid condition, I went to see her. She was extremely methodical and patient taking the history. She explained all options for treatment clearly. She did not push courses of treatment. She had a conservative &quot;wait and see&quot; approach with my condition but was clear what the conditions of the waiting were, and when we would take action. Intelligent, competent, and clear. I adored being under her care.  "
1223,38587,0.0,Doctor was rude to me. picks and chooses her patients;doesn't take take certain types of patients. (weird!)  Billing system is screwy as well.  Won't go back.  
1224,38587,0.0,"Her office staff is awful.  The blood draw they gave me was messed up and I had to go back again after fasting a second time.  She seems very knowledgeable, but her demeanor is incredibly condescending and rude.  "
1225,38588,1.0,"Top notch doctor. I have been a patient of Dr Dale Abbott for more than a decade.  Dr Dale Abbott provides clear and thorough  explanations of medical conditions and treatment options.  He has patience and is nerver too busy to answer questions. He is remarkably knowledgeable. That being said, if he is not sure, he will  say so.    Excellent doctor! "
1226,38588,1.0,Dr Abbott has been our family doctor for almost 20 years.  He has always been very available and gone to some length to answer our questions and concerns.  
1227,38588,1.0,"I found Dr Dale Abbott to be compassionate. I was seen in an ER out of my Primary Drs area, he came to see me and was kind and attentive. I know one of his former nurses, she also says he was a good doctor and a pleasure to work with. "
1228,38588,1.0,He is a very poor doctor.  Refused to send inlaw to specialist after repeated pleas.  Gives a pill for everything and has often given wrong diagnosis and meds. 
1229,38588,1.0,Father was patient for years and the last few (5-10 years) had complaints relating to his heart. Doctor always sent him home saying there was nothing wrong with him. He died of a massive heart attack and the Coroner report said that there was &quot;years&quot; of heart disease. Father was only 66 years old. 
1230,38588,1.0,"constently makign mistakes with stepfather, could be deadly. seen doc once myself and didnt want to take the time to check me out, would not see him again, and stepfather doesnt liek him eather "
1231,38589,0.0,"I have complex medical conditions. I have had 5 surgeries in the last 10 years. I work with a ENT, Neurologist, Orthopedic surgeon. Dr. Adolph coordinates all the the treatment and tests. She presecribes all medications. When I started treatment with her my functioning level was very sedintary. After 2 years and with her expertize not only in her own professional skilss but in coordination care with multiple doctors, I'm up and around and now am able to participate and enjoy life again.  "
1232,38589,0.0,I thought the doctor did an excellent job with both my wife and I.  
1233,38590,1.0,"This Doctor, especially when you are coming out of a program at a clinic (outpatient), and paying 740 bucks for your suboxone, is a true life saver! he actually &quot;listens&quot; to the patient and its a tradgety that he is not a full time general practictioner as well as addiction specialist, because alot of friends and family could use a doctor that listens for a change and doesnt treat you like youre an ADDICT!!! i highly, highly, recommentd him, scale of 1 to 10 hes got an 11. yes i know hes in tacoma and its a jaunt to drive, but its once a month, no drama, and you arent on a waiting list or not taking new patiens like the ones i found in my area. if there was a way to show him how much he has saved my life, &quot;i would&quot;, all i can do is refer you to him cuz hes the bomb!!! "
1234,38590,1.0,"well,  I'm very pleased with dr.alord. I had another suboxone doctor about 10 months ago and he retired.  I called every suboxone I found and they all wanted me to pay between 500 and 1000 bucks for an initial evaluation.  but I already had one.  withmy retired doc which I payed 400 bucks for.  anyway dr. alvord was the only one that didn't charge me for it.  I only pay $100 a month which is much cheaper than anyone else.  he's  a great guy and I would never choose anyone else.  thank you so much dr. alvord.   "
1235,38591,1.0,"I highly recommend Dr. Albrecht. Not only is he very knowledgeable, but he also is kind, personable and a good communicator who spent the time with me I needed.  "

1242,38595,1.0,Dr. Abbott was very helpful by explaining what is wrong with my back.  I have been to many other doctors and have never been told any clear answers about what is wrong.  I even called his office later with another question and he got right on the phone to answer it for me.  I would highly recommend him if you have back pain.  
1243,38595,1.0,Large blonde nurse was very rude and refused to answer my inquires.  Dr. did a procedure on my back to address pain and said we would get to the other areas that are painful after we see if this helps.  When I went in for my follow up appointment he asked me how it went.  I told him that the pain at the injection sight was much better but the other painful areas were still very bothersome.  He asked me about this &quot;new&quot; pain.  He apparently forgot our earlier conversation and didn't have any notes.  He wanted to argue about this and had no clue as to my original reason for seeing him.  
1244,38596,1.0,. very good drs love dr abdulla helped find out what the issues with my sons problems were thankfull to the fullest 
1245,38596,1.0,". Great doctor, very good knowledge, highly recommended, great staff, wonderful front desk, but no good parking "
1246,38596,1.0,This Dr would not listen to me or my son and kept interrupting when we tried to tell him what was wrong. He misdiagnosed him with IBD and then said his abdominal pain was psychological. He was very arrogant and pompous and ultimately was wrong because later my son was found to be lactose intollerant and his problems went away when we changed his diet. I would not recommend him.  
1247,38596,1.0,"Dr. Abdullah is very helpful.  I asked my child's pediatrician about him and he said that he is absolutely the best!  My pediatrician is not related to Mary Bridge in any way.  Everyone is friendly and helpful and procedures are explained in detail.  I also have opted out of procedures preferring to take a &quot;wait and see&quot; approach and that has been fine also.  The dietitian also explains things very well and has given me very useful suggestions on how to get my children's weight up.  My only complaint is the time we have to wait between when the nurse weighs the children and the doctor comes in and then between the doctor and the dietitian and then between the dietitian and the nurse coming back in to give us the discharge papers.  I am usually at the office for a total of two hours every time (with my two children).  In my opinion, it is more important for my children to get the BEST doctor, than for me to choose another doctor based on petty complaints! "
1248,38596,1.0,"Great doctor! Very helpful, kind and compassionate.  I would recommend him to any parent.  "
1249,38596,1.0,"Dr. Abdullah isn't awful, he just can't seem to spend time explaining anything to worried parents. I'm not sure he does this on purpose or if it's because the hospital and satellite clinics have him over booked. He was friendly enough and seemed genuinely concerned for our child. His office staff at  the satellite clinic we go to however are horrible, unprofessional and rude. We had so many concerns that they refused to acknowledge and would never return calls. This alone would make me choose a different physician. "
1250,38596,1.0,"Horrible. Dr. Abdullah himself wouldn't be so bad if his staff weren't oh so awful. NOBODY will answer your questions, procedures will get scheduled of which you will have no idea what they are, what they're for and no one at their office will explain them to you. Just don't bother. Go somewhere else.  "
1251,38596,1.0,Made fun of me for my gas... not very helpfull as far as answering my questions. Has a lot to learn when it comes to social relationships. Dont go to this doctor....  He too full of himself 
1252,38596,1.0,"This doctor seems intent on finding something wrong with my son, simply because he's small. He gains weight, but not as much as the growth charts say he should. We've seen dieticians in the office (from whom we've received conflicting advice), have run tests, and haven't found anything wrong, but still, he wants to see us for follow up, after follow up. I believe my son's genetics probably account for his small size. The only thing our appointments have succeeded in doing is making me question my parental instincts. I can not recommend seeing this doctor. On top of all this, I have been double billed for visits and it has taken me months of phone calls to the clinic to get it resolved.  "
1253,38596,1.0,I went to abdullah for approx 5 years and was misdiagnosed and in the process of that had to have 2 unnecessary surgeries.  I would definitely tell you to see someone else!!!!! 
1254,38596,1.0,he was determined to diagnose my son with something he doesn't have. we went to the appointments as schedualed and all follow ups. we had many tests preformed and when he desided to do surgery to see if he could see if there was intestinal ulcers (celeacs disease sp&#63;). all other tests were negative and we stopped going to him.  
1255,38597,0.0,"Darcie took the extra time to really ask how i was doing. And she explained the prescriptions she gave me and what i could do to improve my life, to the point that i could live without the prescriptions that i'm taking. That part is up to me. I drive an hour to get to her office. I have thought about changing to a closer doctor, but I don't want to be treated like a number. I want to be treated like a person, and Darcie cares. I would recommend Darcie to any friends and family that need a doctor. I think you will be pleasantly surprised. :) "
1256,38598,1.0,He did not pick up my severe brain injury and led me to crash a car going at freeway speeds. My TBI has only worsen over the years.  
1257,38598,1.0,"I've known Dr. Aigner (and have been his patient) for 40+ years (a touch of the &quot;Falling Sickness&quot; as The Bard would call it). I've always been VERY satisfied with his Care, Competence, Service, Interpersonal Skills, and Professionalism. "
1258,38598,1.0,Very rude and treated me with no respect

1261,38599,0.0,Very unprofessional and immature.  Do not recommend.  
1262,38599,0.0,Dr. Abraham is a wonderful doctor. She truly cares about her patients and makes sure they are well taken care of.  
1263,38599,0.0,I went to Dr. Abraham as a specialist for Adult ADHD. She was recommended by another UW Physician collegue. I was very impressed by her knowledge and expertise in this field. My treatment was immediately effective (via meds). She is very professional and I am very comfortable discussing a rather personal medical condition that has effected me my whole life. She is easy to talk to and genuinely cares about patients in her care. Highly recommended.  
1264,38600,1.0,"Dr. Alston is very thorough.  He is not compelled by insurance company scrutiny and will order proceedures and tests that he feels appropriate.  He spends time with his patients to make sure that he understands, and does a good job of communicating.  Highly recommended GP.  "
1265,38600,1.0,Dr. Alston is a wonderful Dr. and very knowledgable. He takes the time to listen and explain. I highly recommend him.  
1266,38601,0.0,She helped me alot and gave me wonderful care. This docter was very caring and very knowlegible. 
1267,38601,0.0,"Impatient &amp; rude, did not listen to patient. Seems more interested in what she thinks than what my wishes were "
1268,38602,1.0,"Both my husband and I see Aflatooni and he is very personal, caring ,and he is one of the best MDs I've came across in many years. He truly cares about his patients.  "
1269,38602,1.0,Very caring and compassionate staff and Dr.! 
1270,38603,1.0,"If you want to die a slow painful death, see Alrashedy, notice I didn't refer to him as Doctor. He does not care about the health and welfare of pt, he cares only that he looks good, and sounds right.  He mis-diagnoised me, and stuck to the diagnosis even after I was diagnoised with a different syndrome from a specialist. He refuses to listen to pt or other doctors.   Stay away from Mida also "
1271,38604,1.0,"The medical community needs more physicans like Dr. Aguila!  His professionalism, dedication, knowledge, bed side manner.. he is the standard! For those working around him, elevate your level of care, because he provides nothing but the best!! "
1272,38605,1.0,"Very compassionate, knowledgeable and thorough. He has a strong interest in the newest research and you never feel rushed through the visit (which is probably why the wait times can be long as he must spend a good amt of time w/each patient.) Also good sense of humor and all-around good guy.  :) "
1273,38605,1.0,"Dr. Addison is the most amazing doctor! I have been a patient for 9 years and refuse to give him up even having moved to two different states! He is the only doctor who really affirmed what I was saying and went well above and beyond to help me figure out what was wrong. It was also largely in part to his plan for me that I was able to finally conceive a baby. I would reccomend him to ANYONE, however I must agree with the above comment that his office staff is not so hot! I usually just deal with them the least that I can and then handle everything important with Dr. Addison himself. He is AMAZING! "
1274,38605,1.0,"As any patient of his knows, wait times can be long.  However, he treats all his patients with so much care and compassion!  My husband, myself, and our 5 year old (which Dr. A delivered via C-section) all love him.  He has always taken the time to listen and is not above admitting that he doesn't know everything.  He has referred us to specialists when necessary and is a wonderful family doctor.  My only real complaint is his office staff.  They must purposely pick the least compassionate people from MultiCare and station them at this office, because I have NEVER had a good experience with the front desk or the nurses in the office.  I would definitely recommend Dr. Addison, as long as you have the patience to wait for 45 minutes for every office visit.  "
1275,38605,1.0,"This man is wonderful!! He has been my doc for 5 years, my husbands for 4 (my hubby HATES doctors, but likes him) And also my 2 childrens dr from birth. He diagnosed many problems in my kids most people ignored, Like severe reflux in both. Very caring and knowledgeable. Its quite a wait at his office, but the great care is WELL worth it!!! "
1276,38606,0.0,"I specifically made an appt to get antibiotics for an upper respiratory infection that I was afraid would migrate to my sinuses.  My regular doc wasn't available so I saw Dr. Adams. After explaining my problems with a very serious sinus infection last year, I asked for antibiotics. After trying to prescribe me a garlic/ginger tea, she agreed to prescribe antibiotics. I took them for 7 days, with no improvement then immediately got worse as soon as the prescription ran out.  I returned and was able to see my regular doc who explained that Adams had given me a &quot;naturopathic dose&quot; of antibiotics that effectively did nothing.  It is now two weeks later, I am much worse (though the REAL antibiotics I received last week have helped).  Given that I went in specifically asking for antibiotics and she gave me a dose not powerful enough for an infant, I think this is not only bad medicine, but bad boundaries.  I would not still be sick if I had informed consent about the dosage.  unacceptable. "
1277,38607,2.0,Dr. Ames is a great doc. Only one around willing to dig further than the surface to find the root of the problem 
1278,38607,2.0,"Very attentive and listens.  Both a naturapath and MD, and broadly educated. "
1279,38608,0.0,"I have had Dr. Adams has my physician for several years now. She is knowledgeable, a good listener and thorough in her examination. She is willing to refer you to a specialist if you need one. She has a complete natural pharmacy and also is willing to tell you where you can get it cheaper if she knows. If it's a medicine she doesn't have, she will tell you where you can get it. I appreciate her position attitude and the way she conducts herself as a physician. She shares results of tests with you and tells you what they mean. I have recommended her to many people.  "
1280,38608,0.0,Has kept me off antibiotics for about 5 years now-- healthier than ever! Dr. Adams knows her stuff and has been willing to keep searching for answers when other doctors fail. 
1281,38608,0.0,Wonderful caring doctor. Will spend the time needed with you to go cover everything which can sometimes make her late for the next person but then she'll do the same with them. Staff is great too. Full pharmacey of naturopathic products but doesn't hesitate to tell you where you can get it cheaper. Will refer to other doctors and welcomes feedback and second opinions. Can't say enough good things about her. 
1282,38609,0.0,One of the best MDs I've ever met!  Excellent listener and problem solver.  Most helpful in facilitating my care with other specialists.  I really felt that she had my best interests at heart.  You will not be disappointed; I would not want to see anyone else for my sports medicine needs. 
1283,38609,0.0,"Fabulous doctor, caring and empathetic, and set me up with exactly the information and physical therapy I needed.  "

1286,38610,0.0,"Dr. Abramski has been extremely effective at helping my mom. She has been seen by many psychiatrists that have been aloof, distant, and have not given her the right medication. She has struggled for years with her issues. Ever since my mother started seeing Dr. Abramski she has been at her best and has resumed her normal life. My mother was always skeptical and resistant to seeing psychiatrists and Dr. Abramski's professional and compassionate treatment has changed her attitude towards the profession. Thank you Dr. Abramski! "
1287,38610,0.0,"Dr. Abramski is one of the most compassionate psychiatrists I've met. I felt like he understood what I was dealing with, not just treating it. He's always friendly, and goes out of his way to aknoledge me. I highly reccomend him to others! "

1290,38611,1.0,"This pysician is brusque, to the point, in a hurry to get through appointments. Seems to understand latest medications but always does not check past medical history for important details. Effective diagnostics, good results with medications he recommends. "
1291,38612,1.0,"I transferred to Dr Alinea after getting the run around from another clinic. He listened to me , found out exactly what was going on after doing some tests then sent me to a specialist for my back and I have been doing fine.  "

1294,38614,1.0,"He is the best. I highly recommend this doctor to all women. He is very kind, passionate, and a very good listener. "
1295,38614,1.0,"I was referred to Dr. Saraf when my GP identified that I had a substantial fibroid issue.  Let me first say that I don't need my doctor to be my emotional support, or my cheerleader --I have family &amp; friends for that. I need my doctor to provide the information that only a medical professional can provide, and the skill to do something about it.  Dr. Saraf did that for me in a way that I absolutely appreciated.  He is professional, articulate, concise, and understandable.  His approach through my recovery from surgery was a conservative one, holding me on ice then clear liquids longer, as a means of controlling the process for a successful outcome.  I agree with his approach and am grateful for his results.  I highly recommend Dr. Saraf and feel very fortunate to have found him.  "
1296,38614,1.0, 
1297,38615,1.0,"Dr. Agress is my favorite OB so far.  He's very knowledgeable, compassionate and has a great sense of humor (I find it comes in handy when your feet are up in stir ups:).  I had a D&C; with him with no complications at all.  Great doc! "
1298,38615,1.0,"Dr. Agress was one of the best doctors I ever had. He delivered my second and third children. Big difference between the doctor of my first and Dr. Agress. I was going thru a divorce during my 3'd pregnancy and would go in and cry each visit. He was very caring and compassionate. Has a great sense of humour. With my 2'nd pregnancy, I had begun with another doctor, who, when I started bleeding vaginally and wanted a note to stay home from work the rest of the pregnancy(working on my feet, lifting heavy objects, etc.)(had a miscarriage shortly before and was worried that I'd have another one) laughed and told me that if stress could cause a miscarriage then all teen moms would loose their babies. Left her and went to Dr. Agress. He said that if a woman felt that she couldn't work, he'd support her and give her a note. I also had had a C-section(1st baby) and had been told that I would have to have one all future pregnancies. Dr. Agress let me try and have a vaginal birth. Very patient. "
1299,38615,1.0,"Dr. Agress was not my OB, but was the OB on-call when I delivered. In my opinion, he appears to be an excellent surgeon and is very well-suited to deal with emergency situations which one may encounter during labor/delivery. However, I felt that his bedside manner had something to be desired and I felt like my long labor was holding him from some other more important pressing matter. "
1300,38617,2.0,"Made an emergency appointment for Dr. Adams @ 11:00 a.m. the same day. Arrived ten minutes early and was told I had no schedule appointment for that day and was sent home confused and still in pain. Four days later I recieved a bill for missed apointment for the day and time I was turned away on. Sent them a letter explaining that I was there for my appointment and that a witness dropped me off at the time and date of my appoinment. There response letter was we don't believe me or my witness, charges stay on your account. I know I was there when I was suppose to be but will probably have to pay to avoid collection agency and negative credit report.  "
1301,38617,2.0,Made an appointment and showed up 10 minutes early. Was told I did not have an appointment that day (but I did). Went home and 3 days later a bill was sent for missed appointment. Office insists I did not show up and to pay immediately even thou I have witnesses. AVOID.

1303,38619,1.0,"A very friendly, knowledgable, compassionate, and helpful doctor. "
1304,38619,1.0,"Wonderful doctor. Was our family, obstetrics, and pediatric doctor for 5 years and delivered my two children. Very friendly, caring and sincere. Listens, explains, and makes sure you understand things. Shows true interest in the patient's concerns. Very popular doctor, well liked, which is why I rated him a 4 on punctuality. He is very busy. However, once he sees you, he does not try to rush thru the appointment. In order to see him you usually have to schedule well in advance, depending on the concern, which was a downside. The rest of the office is also very friendly and caring as well. Was very happy there until we moved away. "
1305,38620,0.0,Very caring and professional. She is a good listener and makes you feel comfortable and gives you hope.  
1306,38620,0.0,Very young doctor at a large hospital clinic who didn't seem to have any background in trauma even though I was referred from the ER. Only able to see her for 30 minutes once a month so switched to a psych doc that actually did counseling vs meds.  
1307,38621,0.0,"The best doctor I've seen or experienced!  Her knowledge, her kind approach, her brilliance - all shine through.  I highly recommend Dr. Abson and her staff. I'd travel thousands of miles to see her if needed.  "

You can tell that he cares deeply and treats his patients with dignity and respect.  I personally feel empowered and vital after spending some time with him.  I know he is new to the Seattle area; as a native from Seattle, I am so greatful that he is here.  He changed my life for the better and I know he is doing the same for others every single day.    -Crystal Newton "
1318,38625,0.0,"The doctors and staff at Water's Edge Clinic are all top notch. They took a lot of time getting to know me and my needs, and figuring out precisely what was going on in my body. They did NOT spend five minutes with me and guess at the problem - the new patient consultation was about an hour, and they did thorough blood tests to keep track of certain metrics of health. After just a few weeks at the clinic I have lost a significant amount of weight, I look great, I have a ton of energy. In short, I feel like a whole new person. Thank you Dr. Abrams! "
1319,38625,0.0,"Dr. Abrams is a great doc! When I started seeing her I was pretty ill and depressed. After doing a couple of tests to find out what was going wrong in my body we found out my blood sugar, cholesterol, thyroid, and female hormones were out of control. Her treatment plan addressed every one of my problems. I am off my cholesterol pill and my blood pressure is NORMAL! I lost 47Lb and continue my weight loss. I am now taking natural meds to control my cholesterol. I cannot possibly put into words what a wonderful lifestyle change this has been. Dr. Abrams has helped me take control of my health. "
1320,38625,0.0,"Dr. Abrams did an amazing job restoring my health and balancing my hormones. My hot flashes and night sweats are gone.  I sleep so much better.  She helped me lose 25 lbs. and recover my energy and endurance. As a long-term patient of Waters Edge Clinic I have had multiple physical exams and blood draws. My exams were always done by a Doctor, there are no nurses in this office.  I never had a bad experience with a blood draw.  I learned so much about living a healthy life style, having a healthy diet and discovering my food allergies. Dr. Abrams is so caring and took all the time I needed answering all my questions.  I have recommended her to all my friends. "
1321,38625,0.0,"Very unprofessional: 1 During a physical my temp was recorded as 94 deg. I asked why so low and the nurse said the current batch of thermometers was reading low. At home my temp read 102. I was later diagnosed with pneumonia. 2 After numerous attempts by the nurse to draw blood, I was left with bruises and at least 6 needle marks on each arm. 3 I was given a prescription by Dr. Abrams that my pharmacist said it was improperly prescribed. I consulted another physician and he confirmed this. 4 With one of the other prescriptions I developed several serious side effects. I called her office and the nurse told me to continue the medication. I again asked the receptionist if I could speak with the doctor and was told I could make an office appointment 4 da. later to discuss my problems. I said I would seek a second opinion. 4 hr. later Dr. Abrams called me back. There were several other events and comments that made me very uncomfortable and needless to say I did consult another physician. "
1322,38626,1.0,"I selected Dr. Allen because he really partners with me as a patient... shares information... helps me be involved in making smart decisions and choices. I love that through Group Health's website, I can email with him quickly. "
1323,38627,1.0,Amazing doctor! I know it's not fun to wait to see him bc his waiting time is always soooo long but it's definitely worth it! He takes his time with you and answers all your questions and addresses all of your concerns. He explains things in a fashion that makes sense and he makes sure that you're okay before he moves on. His bed side manner is phenomenal and he's so personable... he remembers the littlest details of anything you've ever discussed with him and that's just amazing!  I would recommend him to anyone! 
1324,38627,1.0,"Communication is difficult once your appointment has been completed. Phone calls are not always returned but the nurse that calls tries to be helpful. There is very little follow-up from the doctor. The patient must contact the doctor's office is there is a concern or question following appointments. Which is fine if the communication was answered, but that is not always the case. I realize how busy they can be so I'm not complaining so much as just sharing a patient's perspective. For example, I call for a medication refill, which they authorize with the pharmacy, but then they do not call me back to let me know. Several days later the pharmacy calls because I have not picked up the prescription. The wait time in his offcie is sometimes frustrating - on the average, I wait 45-60 minutes past my schedules appointment time. On the positive side, Dr. Adatia is friendly, knowledgeable, and has helped me with some of my medical issues.  "
1325,38627,1.0,takes a lot of time therefore runs behind schedule but well worth the wait. 
1326,38627,1.0,I really like Dr Adatia.  I take my two children to him as well and they also like him.  He has been very instrumental in getting my daughter's hypothyroidism under control.  He does take his time with you so you may have to wait a little bit to see him.  This is worthwhile when he doesn't rush you out of his office when it is your turn. 
1327,38627,1.0,good physician.  spends alot of time when necessary.   always runs at least 30 minutes late

1331,38632,1.0," Dr. Bagdahdi had no concern whatsoever about my &quot;high risk&quot; pregnancy. I nearly died as well as my baby. I could have gone through a medical malpractice lawsuit, but I didn't because my baby lived. This man has no concern for anyone but himself. All I can say is karma will find him... "
1332,38632,1.0, i honestly cant stand this dr he is always in a hurry to get out of the room and never stays to ask how your doing and doesnt give you the time of day really... i would say that dr jung who works there is the best he always has time for you and answers your questions and concerns with no judgement.. 
1333,38632,1.0, Dr. Baghdadi saved my life as well as the life of our son due to his quick response and immediate decision to do a c-section.  Had he not been my doc (or had I stayed with the MIDWIFE I thought I'd try) I would not be here today.  He may be a man of few words but he is very smart (he has a FACOG ladies!) and knows his stuff.  Numerous doctors since have told me that I am extremely lucky he is my doctor.  
1334,38632,1.0," When I started to miscarry my OB would not see me. Three days later I had a uterine infection and since it was Christmas Eve my OB would not come in, Dr. Baghdadi came in and helped with emergency surgery. When I got pregnant again he said he would help every step of the way and determine why I miscarried the first time. He was very compassionate, helpful, and most of all there to help a dshs patient he had never met on a holiday. Because of him I have a healthy son. "
1335,38632,1.0," When my current doctor at the time decided she would not deliever my baby at good sam 3 days before I was due. I had to go to a new doctor and deliver at a different hospital.. she referred me to Dr. Baghdadi who was the best...I had never met him before all of this and honestly could not have been happier. As you could imagine I was freaking out, BUT Dr. Baghdadi stepped up and I could not have asked for a better outcome. "
1336,38632,1.0," This Dr. is absolutely an ****..When I would tell him that I was having pain during intercourse, he would simply say &quot;don't do it that way&quot; Also, at the time, I was on state medical and needed treatment for dysplasia on my cervix, he wouldn't do the necessary treatment because the state didn't cover it all and I couldn't pay the balance in full. He is a creep..Ladies, stay away from him. Paid/Co-pay:$35000"
1337,38632,1.0," This man was my beloved doctor until I decided to have my third baby at home with a midwife. Since then, he hasn't treated me the same. When trying to become pregnant a fourth time, I asked him about my vitamins and also expressed concerns as I'm almost 40 and it was taking much longer than it had the previous three times. He simply said, &quot;You like all that natural stuff, so just go natural. Let nature take it's course.&quot; He also refused to even look at my supplements I was taking, saying, &quot;Oh, it's all natural. It's fine.&quot; Also, he's NEVER there. I always have to wait several weeks to see him because he's not available...on vacation, etc. "
1338,38634,1.0," caring cardiologist with outstanding clinical skills and up-to-date knowledge. Coordinated my husband's care after a cardiac arrest six years ago. I watched him organize everything, visit at least once daily, and always have time to explain and answer questions, whether mine or interns or residents. My husband is doing well 6 years later after much care from this outstanding MD.  "
1339,38634,1.0," I moved to town and knew no doctors, and did a little snooping and starting going to Dr. Baciewicz.  This was very good fortune.  I don't know that I've ever before seen a Doc that is as good natured, approachable, and most importantly- such a capable listener.  I would extend this praise to his whole practice.  I wish I didn't have to go so often, but have a great deal of comfort and confidence with Dr. Baciewicz and his group.   Oh- as for punctuality- they don't seem to be &quot;like clockwork&quot;- I nearly got my vehicle towed one day that things ran long.  I normally get bent by waiting in rooms for doctors, but in this case I'd wait all day- the care is that good. "
1340,38636,0.0," I've only seen her once, but so far she seems great. She was a good listener, and helped me find solutions for the problems I was having. "
1341,38642,2.0, The best doctor ever!!!! i feel great now...  Clean office and everyone is so friendly 
1342,38642,2.0, Wonderful doctor (Mark) Doesn't BS you like other DC's 
1343,38642,2.0, This is the most amazing- kid friendly office I have ever been to. Dr. Babich (both of them) are super friendly. They have created an office environment where everyone feels like family. I drive about 45 minutes out of my way to continue to see them. 
1344,38645,0.0," This doctor doesn't know her ass from her head. Prescribes unneeded and dangerous medication, and even manages to mistake a bed sore for an unspecified infection. One can also wonder why an osteopathologist works as an internist, since her educational history (http://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-mary-badger...) does not show any additional training/education that would justify her position as an internist. Her knowledge is severely lacking, prescriptions are questionable, and i would definitely NOT recomend her to anyone.  "
1345,38645,0.0," I went to Dr. Badger for the first time today for an annual physical.   She listened to my concerns and addressed every one of them in a friendly, non-alarmist manner.  At no time was I at a loss for what was coming next or how long it would take.  The staff at the front desk is satisfactory, the nurse I had was very pleasant and capable (I had an EKG in the office administered by the nurse).  This doctor seems to know the latest information and the pros and cons of each of them.  I thought she had a good 'bedside manner' and she was focused on her specialty (versus trying to be everything to everybody - I am leary of the doctor who can 'do it all!).  She also knows my gynecologist and says she will work closely with him if my test results indicate coordinated care is needed.  I like her and hope that this turns out to be a long-term care internist for me.  "
1346,38645,0.0," The best diagnostician I know. Her patients always come 1st, too. "
1347,38645,0.0, She was great. She explored possibiliies that other doctors hadin't even looked at. Asked lots of questions and followed up with me afterward. I felt like she actually listened to me.  
1348,38645,0.0," This DR, is amazing.. Such a special caring person, NEVER too busy but always swamped. You feel like you are the only patient this extremely in demand DR has, a class act.. A diamond in the ruff.... I am my family are so fortunate to have her looking after our well being. She is extrmely open minded, listens well to what you have to say, makes very informed decisions, is not reluctant to consult other sources, and your health and welfare always seems to come first, despite all the insurance limitations and red tape. You are the best Dr. Mary Badger..thank you for taking us under your wing.. now go out and enjoy the outdoors you love so much....  "
1349,38650,0.0, Dr Babcock was my doctor for almost 30 years. I only stopped seeing her because I moved across the state and don't go back often enough to have her continue as my main physician. I absolutely love her. Going in to see her was more like visiting with a friend than going to the doctor.  I would love to find a doctor for my son that is as great as Dr Babcock was for me. 
1350,38650,0.0, Many of the other doctors and their families use her as their general Doctor.  
1351,38650,0.0," Dr.Babcock is the best Doctor I have ever found, and would NEVER switch to anyone else.  "
1352,38652,1.0," Dr Backous performed operations on both my husbands ears and when he was examined by a reputable audioligist for hearing aids, the audiologist was horrified at what had been done. One ear was so bad that she could not fit it with a hearing aid as the canal was so mutilated. I dont know what we should do,if anything, about this but it doesnt seem right. "
1353,38652,1.0, He took the time to listen to my concerns and his staff is real helpful with insurance and trouble shooting difficulties. 
1354,38652,1.0," Dr. Backous is an amazing and knowledgeable surgeon.  While he often seems very rushed (as others pointed out) I have found that if you tell him you have some questions and get him to slow down, he is very good at answering your questions.  The surgery he performed on my ear (a reconstructive one many years after a mastoidectomy I had as a child) significantly improved my ear's ability to self-maintain (as he promised it would).  I decided after my surgery that even though he didn't make me feel all warm &amp; fuzzy I would stick with him as long as I could because I knew he was excellent at what he did.  Bottom line - If you want someone to discuss/consult/help you process your decisions, he may not be the one for you.  But if you want someone who will be very straight forward and an excellent surgeon - look no further. "
1355,38652,1.0," I had to come down from Alaska for emergency surgery. This doctor saved my life, literally! He was funny, witty, and made me feel a lot better. I wouldn't go to anyone else. "
1356,38652,1.0," On a positive note, my 9 year old son adores Dr. Backous. He's great with boys; he puts them at ease and makes lots of jokes; my son doesn't want to go anywhere else! It's impossible for me to evaluate Backous' surgery skills, since I have no basis for comparison: I don't know what another surgeon would have done differently. But I have not been impressed with this doctor. I enjoy his personality, but I have been very frustrated with his level of communicating. He seems to talk in circles and even outright contradict himself from visit to visit. I feel he's either not listening to my questions or doesn't know what he's talking about or changes his medical opinion frequently. My son ended up with a modified radical mastoidectomy, which I wasn't expecting, wasn't consulted on and am not sure he needed, with no hearing improvement in spite of prosthesis and now constant worry about complications. Feel Backous should use more tech to asses treatment. Wish had sought 2d opinion.  "
1357,38652,1.0," He is the best in his field in the Pacific Northwest, which is why he's so hard to get into! Paid/Co-pay:$10"
1358,38652,1.0, Condescending doctor. Spent very little time trying to understand my concerns. 
1359,38652,1.0," I went to see this dr. for recurrent ear infections. At the beginning of the appt. I told him all the things I had already unsuccessfully tried for the problem. At the end of that discussion, he reommended a solution that I already said had not worked for me! When I pointed this out, he became very defensive and annoyed. You could tell he just couldn't wait to hustle me out of his office. He was smiling and nice and had a good demeanor when I first walked in, but beware if you ever disagree or question him. You will see a different side. His body language was that he was turning away from me as the conversation went on. He was very close to turning his back on me. If you are a patient who likes to be part of your care, and who expects to have some input into your own treatment, I would go somewhere else! "
1360,38652,1.0, Very arrogant. Did not listen when I had a conern and did not really answer any of my questions. I didn't feel comfortable at all. 
1361,38652,1.0, I had constant earinfections for many years. this Dr. got rid of them. 
1362,38652,1.0," My husband had tympanoplasty (ear drum repair) performed. He was not provided with comprehensive materials detailing the risks of this surgery. When my husband was left with permanent tinnitus as a result of this surgery, we asked Dr. Backous what the alternatives were in terms of treating the condition. He made a joke of my husband's situation by replying &quot;Well, he can join the American Tinnitus Association. At least that will keep him from committing suicide.&quot; I would NOT recommend this doctor.  "
1363,38660,0.0, She's always too busy to assist with anything and we feel like it's an assembly line production.  
1364,38660,0.0, she's worthless and took tests and never even talked to me about them! But she sure did send the bill!! 
1365,38660,0.0," Before I found Dr. Babol I was in a very bad situation with a different Doctor that had my health spinning out of control.  She didn't have to help me, in fact there wasn't any other Doctor's willing to do so.  I have only received the best care and would recommend anyone to her.  "
1366,38660,0.0," This is the worst doctor I've ever been too.  Made orthotics visibly incorrectly for a heel spur and then wouldn't redo them.  LONG wait in the waiting room with post-surgical patients in obvious pain.  Rushed visit.  Incompetent assistant (does she speak much English&#63;) and incompetent office staff, but VERY skilled at billing the insurance company.  You check in with your credit card:  I've never seen that before or since. Billed insurance megabucks and did harm.  Continues to advertise twice a week in local paper.  DON'T GO TO DOCTORS WHO ADVERTISE--that was my mistake.  I was in pain and I rushed to the first doctor I saw.  Do your research. There are plenty of podiatrists:  ANY body would be better than this one.  "
1367,38660,0.0, Very rushed only spent a few minutes with me really didn't go over all of my concerns.  
1368,38664,1.0, Dr. Bachman has been a naturopath doctor for quite a long time.  I have gone to him for a long time.  He is very knowledgeable. 
1369,38664,1.0, Keeps up to date in field. Very thorough and  helpful when other docs can't help. 
1370,38666,0.0," Dr. Bagatell seems to lack the much-needed up-to-date knowledge in my area of concern (pituitary disease) &amp; appeared generally dismissive and inflexible to most suggestions. Despite being incapable of helping me with my chronic and debilitating health issues, she refused to provide a much-needed referral to a specialist (pituitary endocrinologist), who had already told me that he was indeed able to assist. When endeavoring to resolve such an issue by phoning her about my consultation with the specialist (and why I desperately needed such a referral), she blatantly failed to return any of my phone calls. Her conduct was unprofessional, unprincipled and arrogant. Since obtaining a referral from another GP, I have been diagnosed with hypopituitarism (diabetes insipidus and growth hormone deficiency) and I am also suspected of Cushing’s disease. Carrie Bagatell was indeed aware that my lab work demonstrated (random) elevated cortisol levels, yet she neglected to follow up. FORMER patient "
1371,38669,2.0,  
1372,38673,0.0," Staff was very helpful with insurance changes that I had, very professional. Did not return calls promptly however "
1373,38673,0.0, She is great!  She has been the best eye doctor i have ever had. 
1374,38691,1.0, The staff and the doctor were both great!! He was very gentle and thorough.  I would recccomend him in a second!!! 
1375,38691,1.0, Doctor was very helpful and kind.  Staff was very helpful and understood my concerns. Would recommend with no hesitation. 
1376,38691,1.0, During my visit I felt that I was treated horribly.I would NEVER recommend this doctor to my family and friends.  I felt this visit was a complete waste of time and money.Overall I would rate this visit : AWFUL! 
1377,38694,2.0," Usually not rushed, willing to spend time talking even on small items.  Would like to see faster turnaround of physical/blood results, 2 weeks to get the information is too long.  "
1378,38694,2.0,.  Good listener and helpful with information beyond diagnosis 
1379,38695,1.0," I had both knees repaired with Oxford partial medial surgery. Dr badger's entire staff was so helpful from the first appt. With  XRay to pre op. To post op and all the follow up after. drug issues were handled quickly and effectively. Easy transition to ween off oxycodone. Only problem was with stomach acid reflux side affect.  Billing was hassle free as was all the follow up appts. Very intelligent personnel helping with all questions regarding life after knee surgery.  I had this done winter of 2010 and Im riding the bike,swimming in Hawaii this year, and getting the golf swing back somewhat.  "
1380,38695,1.0, I got addicted really fast to oxycodone and oxycontin because everytime I asked for a refill he would tell his medical assistants whatever the patient wants. Thinks he is GOD becuase he is Mormon. Dont care if his patients die. 
1381,38697,1.0," this doctor is not nice. in fact, he is one of the worst doctors i have seen . he doesn't communicate with patient, doesn't listen &amp; answer patient's questions.the office staff are rude and treat the patient like a piece of junk. i wouldn't comeback to shoreline clinic anymore "
1382,38697,1.0, i am DR Bagan's patient.he is very helpful and nice and i am happy to be his patient.  strongly recommend to everyone 
1383,38697,1.0," DR BAGAN, Never listens &amp; answers patient's question , he avoids eye contact with patient, he is always in hurry and leave the patient in confusion.  i wouldn't recommend him to families and individuals "
1384,38699,1.0, Dr Bader was my Dr when I was a child and I now take all 3 of my kids to him.I like the fact that he listens to me and addresses my concerns. He is very nice and a great Dr. he is very knowledgeable and knows what hes doing. When ever i need to get in he always finds a way to get me in even when he is booked for the day. Thank you Dr. Bader.  we appreciate you 
1385,38700,1.0," Dr. Baer and his staff are wonderful! If going to the dentist can ever be considered a pleasure, the staff at this office has made it so. They are warm, friendly, very professional, and Dr. Baer provides superb dental care and explains everything clearly and understandably. I am so glad I switched to this office! "
1386,38708,1.0," Both my husband and I have him for a dr and he does NOT have a good bedside manners nor takes time to listen. He is too quick to refer you out and we waist our money and time coming to see him. My husband had hurt his foot, we explained the whole story over the phone making the appt. we get there and he tells us to GO have x-rays done on the other side of town @ 3pm on a Wednesday. Joseph Badolato didn't come into work the rest of the week. If it wasn't for my husband and myself raising hell with his medical assistants, they would of let my husband sit over the weekend with a broken foot!!!! He had BROKE 4 bones in his foot and ended up having surgery that Friday. Dr. Badolato's MA calls 2 wks later asking if we got in to see the Podiatrist (the foot surgeon). Wow, really, what great health care! I have not had good health care service with him either. My husband and I are finding another doctor. "
1387,38708,1.0, Dr. Badolato is in a very busy family practice but he takes time to listen to your symptoms and prescribe the necessary treatment or order the tests that will help with his diagnosis.  My wife and I are pleased to have him as our doctor 
1388,38722,2.0, Absolutely wonderful first impression.  The staff was pleasant and Dr Babin really took the time to explain my options.   Getting my teeth cleaned there next week! 
1389,38724,1.0,Great Cancer Treatment.  Staff of five docs and excellent experience 
1390,38724,1.0,"Dr. John is a gifted diagnostician who really cares about his patients. I have never had a doctor spend so much time with me, listen so well and ask such in-depth questions before. He treats the root causes, not just the symptoms. I am so grateful I found him! "
1391,38724,1.0,Cancer treatment is excellent. Cutting edge integrative immunotherapy and vaccine development.  Excellent care! 
1392,38724,1.0,"Dr. Catanzaro is phenomenal. He is an out-of-the-box thinker that TRULY cares about his patients. He is so unique in the way he spends so much time with his patients, and always gets to the root problem rather than treating just the symptoms of the health problem. He runs thorough tests, and spends a lot of time with his patients explaining the results. His practice is one of a kind.  "
1393,38725,2.0,great people and place.  giving the highest possible rating for Dr Card 
1394,38726,0.0,"Found her to not be compassionate whatsoever. I have a high risk pregnancy and she brushed off every concern i had as unimportant. She showed almost no emotion. I felt like i was part of a business transaction every time I had scheduled with her. My baby is at high risk for medical issues after birth due to meds I had to take. She did not act concerned or informed whatsoever. She refused to communicate with my previous drs from previous pregnancies about my history and condition. She is very young and has the attitude that she knows more than you do. I would not recomend her to other pregnant women as their dr. However, her MA Brittany is quite wonderful :) "
1395,38726,0.0,"I called 5 times for a change in my prescription.  Had to call every time - never got a return call.  Not only would they not help me with a prescription, but they cancelled my existing prescription, leaving me severely anaemic and without birthcontrol.  I am making a formal complaint. "
1396,38726,0.0,"No follow up, and an awkward visit. I would not suggest for someone who may have questions, or possible health issues. "
1397,38726,0.0,Dr. Calvert does not get back to her patients promptly.  I am still waiting for her to call me about a prescription refill I requested last week.  It takes 3 to 4 phone calls to get a rx refill and there is no communication from her office in explanation of lack of refill called in.  To not be in communication about rx refill with someone who is trying a new SSRI with discontinuation side effects is irresponsible and poor patient care.  
1398,38727,1.0,"This was the best eye examination I have ever received.  Dr. Campbell explained what he was doing and described the results as he went through a number of procedures.  Two of these procedures I had never had before. He was candid: mentioned the possibility of emerging macular degeneration, but not a certainty.  Mentioned onset of cataracts, but not likely to need surgery for a long time. Described cataract treatment in detail, but estimated I would not need it for years.  Dr. Campbell seemed to want to anticipate my questions, and to provide the answers as we went through the exam.  He made this exam an interesting and educational experience.  I score him highly for &quot;bedside manner. &quot; "
1399,38727,1.0,"Ehh, the doctor was ok. It was a very expensive place for glasses. Went to a optical place in Ballard that had a great doctor and they were a little more reasonably price. "
1400,38727,1.0,"great office, great doctor, great glasses to choose from. Dr Campbell and his staff are truley a hidden gem in seattle. A little pricey, but well worth it! "
1401,38727,1.0,I have seen him for 10+ years and still go to him (even though I live 20 mi away) – would highly recommend him.   He is great at explaining what is happening and works hard to find solutions to atypical vision problems.  
1402,38728,0.0,"After a string of doctors, this Cawse-Lucas came through for me in a major way. I'm very, very lost now that she's moved on to teaching.  "
1403,38728,0.0,"She was very dismissive of my symptoms both times I saw her and when she misdiagnosed me as there being nothing wrong with me, she refused to prescribe me antibiotics or see me for another visit.  "
1404,38729,2.0,Wonderful Dr. Very kind and helpful.  
1405,38730,0.0,Very disappointed. Went to the doctor for several reasons and she didn't help me with anything. 
1406,38730,0.0,"• Uncommunicative:Failed to tell me findings of  her study of my heart.    • Egotistic: Refused to refer me to specialists, citing her credentials were sufficient.    • Unknowledgeable: Far from up-to-date on current info, meds, concerning the major condition I saw her for.     • Omitted valuable info in med records, Put made up info in med records &quot;to help me remember who you are&quot;.    • Would agree to refer me to therapuetic providers in emails, and medical records, then call me and reverse her decisions.     Her bull was so overwhelming for me during a very fragile period of time, I didn't even have the energy to try and start up with another doctor. Shame on her.  "
1407,38731,1.0,"Poor, Dangerous. Doesn't ask what the issues are. Won't get off chair to look. Prefers to fill out paperwork during visit, (20 min worth on average). His negligence almost killed me. A real 007. Got myself a real Dr. after that. "
1408,38731,1.0,"He is ok so far, he is much better than other doctors Ive dealt with. You do wait sometimes for him, but its only because he does take his time listening. Obviously, he is specialized in one thing so the only thing I can say is he kind of blew off a couple concerns I had but I just went to a specialist for those issues. But when I am sick or something Id go back. "
1409,38731,1.0,Dr. Cates sincerely cares about his patients. He really listens to your concerns and I did not feel like the visit is rushed. He's easily the best primary care physician I've every had in all of my 55 years.  
1410,38731,1.0,Dr. Cates is wonderful.  Our whole family likes him (and that says a lot - my husband doesn't like many people).  He is very knowledgeable and great at explaining things.  Good suggestions for any health issue that comes up.  We highly recommend Dr.  Cates! 
1411,38731,1.0,Dr. Cates has been there for me and has been the best Doctor for me. Very helpful and caring. Always takes time on visits to go over everything needed. 
1412,38732,1.0,Lack of empathy and compassion. Quickly found another doctor and had successful surgery. 
1413,38732,1.0,"I found Dr. Carpenter to be very caring.  He is in a very specialized field.  By the time you get to him, you have probably been seen or should have been seen by at least one or more physicians that have determined you need a Specialist.  I had a major back surgery by him and there was a huge improvement immediately after the surgery.  I was up and walking the next day.  The difference in pain before and after the surgery was dramatic.  In short, Dr. Carpenter gave me my life back.  He may come off at first as a bit arrogant, but I think it is more &quot;confidence&quot; than arrogance.  And, he has every right to be confident.  He has gone through many years of schooling and instruction to get where he is today.   He knows his stuff well and I'm proof of it!!! "
1414,38732,1.0,"Look up uncaring arrogant doctor and his picture would be there.  Recommended neck fusion with very little diagnosis and wasn't even what I was there for!  His problem is the same as the person that only has a hammer and everything starts to look like a nail.  This doctor simply does not care about the patient.  Only his ego and his pocketbook.  The staff at the reception desk was little better.  To all of them, you're just another person to send a bill to.   Disgusting! "
1415,38732,1.0,"had no problems whatsoever, my condition improved greatly.  Did not find him to be arrogant, very sure of himself, yes, i would have expected no less with the delicate surgery.  "
1416,38732,1.0,so uncaring. few in and outof the room in under 2 minutes. pushed surgery with no reasonable explainations. 
1417,38733,2.0, 
1418,38734,0.0,"An absolute dream Dr.  She and her staff are the most understanding, efficient, skilled medical staff you would want to see.  I had complications after my breast cancer surgery due to the radiation and I was cared for like I was family.   Love her! "
1419,38734,0.0,"Dr. Calhoun is an amazing person with amazing staff.  She always is on time and once when she wasn't, her nurse came in and said that she was running about 10 minutes behind.  She comes highly recommended by other staff and has excellent bedside manner.  Dr. Calhoun as well as her nurse were extremely attentive and took me seriously when I thought I had symptoms of something serious.  Her nurse called me right back, paged the Dr. and got me scheduled immediately to see the Dr.  Dr. Calhoun also said to never feel embarrassed of any symptoms and to always check them out as it could be something - it was great to hear that from an extremely busy surgeon.  "
1420,38735,2.0,very good doctor. Would recommend to others.  
1421,38736,0.0,I have had Dr. Cathcart for 11 years and must say she is amazing!! She listens and is always willing to let me ask any questions that I may have.  She has a great sense of humor and is very caring for her patients!! She treats them like they are her own family. I would recommend her to anyone who has any special problems/complications. She is incredibly  knowledgeable  and wont steer you wrong. 
1422,38736,0.0,I have had a few experiences with Dr Cathcart. Both times I have not been impressed with her. Her bedside manner is rough and rude. I was in the ER one day when I was about 3 months pregnant and she was not only rude to me but my family that was there supporting me. She never gave me an answer about what was wrong and got angry at me for asking questions and explaining my medical history. She told me the I was not the Dr and that she was the one with the medical experience. She did an exam on me and I have not had anything hurt so bad and have someone not even care. I was so unlucky as to have her as the dr on call when I went into labor with my daughter and the only time I have EVER been lucky in dealing with her is that someone else needed a C-Section ASAP and someone else delivered me. I hope I never have to see or deal with Dr. Cathcart again.  
1423,38736,0.0,"The worst people ever, if you want your kid to come last then by all mean pick her.  "
1424,38736,0.0,"I have had a few experiences with Dr. Cathcart as an independent birth professional. I have found her to be a very nice person. I would recommend her to anyone seeking a hospital birth who understands that limitations of OB care, if the Fine of Brasch were unavailable. For those who are looking for an experience in which constant attention can be paid to the mother, I would recommend using a doula for a planned hospital birth. It may also be helpful to consult with a midwife for care out of hospital, or prenatal care with a midwife and the birth with Dr. Fine or Brasch at the hospital (midwives usually attend as doulas in this situation.) Good resources are available at www.bloomspokane.com "
1425,38736,0.0,I love Dr. Cathcart. The only thing keeping her from a five star is the punctuality and I am not so sure how much of that she can literally control in a medical practice.  
1426,38736,0.0,She is VERY understanding.  Plus she is quite respectful of a person with invisible disabilities. She is simply an OUTSTANDING gynecologist and I believe that is God's calling for her.  
1427,38736,0.0,"Dr. Cathcart has delivered all 3 of kids by c-section and performed a hysterectomy on me in the last 10 years. I have had many complications, preeclamsia, hypertension, hernia,gall bladder disease, PPD etc. She has been very helpful in explaining everything and helping to keep my sanity when I needed her advice. I am lucky to have such an attentive doctor. "
1428,38737,0.0,Dr. Chan is my Cardiologist. I think she is a good doctor that understands my problems and I find her to be smart and helpful.  
1429,38738,1.0,"Dr. Cawthon is amazing &amp; saved my life.  Saw him for 12 years in edmonds. Today, have been seizure free for 10years and my life &amp; worries is 100% better thanks to him.  Have been to many different neurologists (that could not stop my seizures).  have had all different kinds of seizures, depending on the medications i was on.  Got to the point of having clusters of seizures every day that medicine could not control. Dr. Cawthon is a genius &amp; knows exactly what he is doing.  Excellent at pt care &amp; being there for his patients.  (gave him 5 stars for being on time, because if he runs late-will always make the time up. I would not be alive today if it wasn't for Dr. Cawthon's knowledge. "
1430,38738,1.0,"Dr. Cawthon is wonderful!  He is very thorough and while my appointments are never on time, I know that it is because he will spend as much time with you as neccesary and cover everything.  He does have a dry sense of humor which I really liked. I'm upset though that he is moving to Walla Walla and now I have to find another doctor.   Would definately recommend! "
1431,38738,1.0,What Dr. Cawthon did was save my life.  He was the first neurologist who knew what was going on with me.  I had simple partial seizures’ my whole life that later developed into grandmal seizures.   Dr. Cawthon was the only doctor who did not ignored my symptoms and took action by sending me to the epilepsy center. He referred me to the Epilepsy center and since than my life has changed forever. 
1432,38738,1.0,"I am VERY DISAPPOINTED with this Dr.  My dad was with him since last May and everytime my mom would have a question, he would snap at her every time.My mom wanted some further tests done and he would just tell her that wouldn't be necessary. Later we found out my dad had a tumor. and today we got a call that he has stage 3 brain cancer.  This guy better be holding his breath that we don't sue him because we will if things dont come out right.  He's very mean, and he's not good with his patients.  All he wants to do is up medication.  My mom questioned him about that we needed like a second opinion and he told my mom that isn't necessary and he's been in this business for 20 years.  Well guess what...This guy shouldn't be a Dr.   Enough said! "
1433,38738,1.0,"Superior, excellent physician.  Very dry sense of humor.  I am a nurse and he is without doubt the best neurologist I have ever worked with.  He got me out of my back pain without ever using a narcotic. "
1434,38738,1.0,"Is more thorough than some. (good, but it sometimes cuts into others' appointment times). Sometimes seems to need to serve the insurance companies needs above the patients needs. Specializes in Epilepsy. "
1435,38739,1.0,One of the best physicians of his kind!!! 
1436,38740,1.0,"After being tortured by Dr. Jack Philbrick, I came to Dr Caruso. I was so scared I wouldn't even let him examine me. He gave me a prescription and set a new apointment. The prescription relaxed me at my next visit. He was patient and let me look through the exam tube. He accurately diagnosed my problem, set up surgury and fixed my problem. He's great! "
1437,38740,1.0,Great bedside manner. That's hard to find these days.. 
1438,38742,0.0,"I have 3 children and we have been going to Dr. Caldwell for over 9 years.  She always takes the time to listen to us in appointments and offer advice.  One of the things I like most is that she respects the child and speaks to them even at young ages.  She involves the parents (of course) but letting a five year old talk about their accomplishments helps take some of the drama out of the dr visits.  Dr. Caldwell is honest and always provides valuable feedback.  The medical assistants are absolutely fabulous!  Working with kids can be tough...especially when giving shots,  but they have the patience, humor and kindness of saints.   Well done on your hiring - keep it up! "
1439,38743,1.0,"If you make it past the waiting room he is a great doctor. I've gone to him for years, but have never once waited less than an hour past my appointment time, usually 1.5 hours. If you don't have three hours to spare, go elsewhere. "
1440,38743,1.0,"Amazing doctor! Kind, caring, knowledgeable and thorough. Highly recommended! "
1441,38743,1.0,I've seen Dr. Call for 20 yrs. I think he is the most caring person and Dr. I've ever known.  
1442,38743,1.0,When I moved to Seattle I had no Dr. and I went to see Dr. Call. He is the nice and it may take some time to see him if you don't have an emergent condition but it is well worth the wait.  The staff is polite and for those of us without health insurance the services are sometimes discounted.  He is thoughtful always listens to you and is sincere and knowledgeable. 
1443,38743,1.0,Dr. Call has been our family doctor for about 22 years and is a great doctor. His staff is friendly and polite as is Dr. Call himself.there has been a few times he's seen me without an appointment in an emergancy.He's not always on time but you must take into consideration the detail he puts into his work. I recommend him to all my friends.  
1444,38743,1.0,"Very personable and upfront.  I have seen him for 22 years.  Takes his time to go over everything.  I only see him once a year unless I have a pressing matter, it is a two hour drive for me one way, but well worth it.  "
1445,38743,1.0,Dr. Call is never on time and always seems rushed. I have waited for him several times for my appointment in excess of 1 1/2 hrs late.  
1446,38743,1.0,"Dr. Call is very thorough and caring, and does a great job with his patients. He is one of the best doctors I have been too and is very considerate. "
1447,38743,1.0,Rude staff. Questionable billing practices.  
1448,38744,2.0,Will be able to give a better rating after surgery.  
1449,38745,1.0,I trust this Doctor with my life and the lives of my two daughters.. I know of many others who owe their lives to his expertise.  
1450,38746,0.0,Dr Carlson wasn't a great fit for me.  I didn't feel like I could talk to her.  It's important for me to feel comfortable with a doctor-- and that just didn't happen.  
1451,38746,0.0,She was fantastic! Took care of my thyroid issue immediately and got me back to feeling fantastic.  I would recommend her to anyone looking for a great endocrinologist 
1452,38746,0.0,A great doctor! 
1453,38747,2.0,I was very happy with the doctor and staff.  They were very helpful with choosing my frames and the best lenses for my new glasses. ! 
1454,38748,0.0,"Dr. Carlson is hands down, amazing.  Her ability to ask the right questions, focus in on the problem, and take action (allowing you to take action) is truly a gift.  It would take a lot for me to ever see anyone else at this point.  In just 4 sessions, I have had just as many breakthroughs and developed a deep trust in her because of her caring, compassionate style.  I never feel pushed or rushed; she never feels distracted, and in sessions with her I feel like the most important thing in her world.  I highly recommend her.  "
1455,38748,0.0,"I haven't seen Dr. Calson in a little less than a year, when I moved out of state, and I have had an extremely difficult time finding anyone that I can feel comfortable trusting now. She was wonderful, no one has compared yet. She did misdiagnose me in one area, but with other medical problems and the grieving I was going through, and the very similar disorder I actually do have, it was understandable, and I think anyone else would have done the same with the information she had. I truly believe had Dr. Carlson not been my therapist and psychiatrist at that time in my life, I wouldn't be here today. I only hope someday soon I can find someone else like her that I can trust with my medications, I've at least found a good therapist. I'd suggest her to anyone in WA, I used to drive from Camano Island to see her.  "
1456,38748,0.0,DR. Gretchen Carlson is an amazing person and doctor.  She is extremely open and caring.  She helped me through the most difficult time in my life.  I just wished I had found her earier in my search for a qualified pychiatrist. 
1457,38749,1.0,"I have seen Dr.Caldwell monthly for 6 months. I feel he is an excellent doctor, very helpful and knowledgeable. He was always willing to answer my questions even when not related to my condition. I would highly recommend him. He knows his stuff and is very respectful and kind hearted. I feel he truly cares about his patients "
1458,38749,1.0,"Dr. Caldwell is a decent dermatologist. A bit rushed, but knows his stuff and gets the job done. His nurse practitioners are great, as well. The desk staff, however, is atrocious. None of them know how to use their own computer system. They lost my appointment twice, even though I had it written on a card with their own handwriting. Both times they made a huge deal and accused me of lying about my appointments instead of just fixing the problem. Not exactly the kind of greeting I was hoping for when I'd waited four weeks for an appointment.  "
1459,38749,1.0,I have been seeing him for years now and his punctuality is never good but he is always nice and helpfull 
1460,38749,1.0,Doctor was great. needs a better MA and more friendly front desk 
1461,38749,1.0,"I had some simple skin tags frozen.  There was a problem with the can of liquid used.  It was sputtering. The nurse thought it was nothing unusual. After 6 weeks some have still not fallen off.  I don't feel I was properly informed of the total charges.  The nurse told me $150.00 and when the bill came, it was an additional $95.00. "
1462,38749,1.0,"like all dr.'s, they do run late, but he was very good, and solved my problem with the right meds in just a few days. Front desk lady was older, but seemed very bright. Dr. had great sense of humor.  "
1463,38749,1.0,When I made my appointment I was told to show up early but did not get seen until 45 minutes past my appointment time. The doctor seemed to be in a rush and did not spend a lot of time with me to go over his diagnosis and seemed rude and unprofessional. He also made some comments that seemed disrespectful. 
1464,38750,1.0,Dr. Carlisle was dismissive and unhelpful. He repeatedly instructed us to &quot;go see a doctor about it&quot;.  
1465,38751,1.0,Have problem.....no real answers. Now what&#63; Felt that I was left hanging... Going to get a second opinion 
1466,38751,1.0,"Dr.  Was VERY rude, he acted like i was stupid and my symptoms were all do to something  i have had all my life and if thats the case why do i hurt now and only after taking a certain medication!&#63; "
1467,38751,1.0,"I agree with the previous opinion that Dr. Carlin is great!  I changed rheumatologist because the one I had been seeing really had no clue what was going on with me.  Dr. Carlin is a no nonsense doctor, gets right to the facts, very observant and attentive to any questions I have.  Would highly recommend Dr.  Carlin and very glad I found him "
1468,38751,1.0,"When he gave me a physical exam he made me feel very uncomfortable.  His behavior was very inappropriate.  I will never go back.  He did tests and never sent the results.  Then when asked about it, all I got was a page of numbers with no explanations.  Terrible doctor! "
1469,38751,1.0,"I was surprised to read the comment on Dr. Carlin, as I have been going to him since 2001 and have always found him concerned and thorough. He is also a listener and has shown me total respect every time I see him.  "
1470,38751,1.0,I don't know what others are seeing.  This guy has been very helpful and attentive.  I have seen none of the arrogance others report and he has been focused on my problem.  I asked for a conservative approach and he has been respectful of that.  I think he's a very good doctor. 
1471,38751,1.0,"Please use caution when going to see this man. I went to see him 3 times hoping each time that he would address the issues of my disease. Each time I went, he got worse. The last time I saw him, he did a physical examination that was not professional. I left and will never return. If you decide to see him, please take someone with you or ask for a nurse to be present during your entire appointment. "
1472,38751,1.0,"This is the most arrogant and rude doctor I have ever met. He treated me as if I was making up my symptoms and did not seem to care about the pain I was in. Once a bone scan showed that nearly every joint in my body was inflamed, he at least agreed I had a problem. But even with that information, he was aloof and condescending. Frankly it made me a nervous wreck worrying about having to go back each month for treatment. Finally I stopped going altogether and found a great doctor who listened to what I had to say and was able to get my health back on track.  "
1473,38751,1.0,"I went to Dr. Carlin for a very serious (potentially life-threatening) illness. I found him to be abrasive, unapproachable, arrogant and completely disinterested in addressing my questions/concerns. Upon getting a second and third opinion elsewhere, I found out that the medication he prescribed for me had the potential to do more harm than good had I continued taking it as he had prescribed. He made me feel like his ego was more important than my health, so have since found another doctor. "
1474,38751,1.0,This doctor appears preoccupied with issues that do not concern the medical profession. I would not see him under any circumstances in the future. 
1475,38752,1.0,"Awesome. Personable, cares a lot about his patients, has a memory like a steel trap (remembers personal details about you even if years have gone by), and keeps his technology &amp; medical information up to date. Has great, friendly staff. All round, one of the best doctors I've ever met.  "
1476,38752,1.0,"Excellent doctor.  Listens carefully and provides clear, helpful information.  "
1477,38753,1.0,"He started my appointment at the pain clinic by telling me that my diagnosis of Fibromyalgia was a crock, and this was before laying one finger on me. I walked out on the appointment. "
1478,38754,1.0,Probably one of the rudest most under-educated doctors on the planet. His staff seems to share in his hatred for his patients as well. I will never be going back to him. Time to retire champ. 
1479,38755,1.0,"I have been with Dr. Caulkins' office for over 20 years now, and I have yet to find a doctor who listens as well as he does, or is as compassionate towards his patients, as he and his staff are. His nursing staff, PA, and ARNP are top notch. The front office staff are very friendly. My boyfriend is now a patient of theirs, too. He thinks the world of the staff, and is very happy with the care and treatment he gets. I have several friends who are also patients there, and they all have nothing but wonderful things to say about the entire staff. I have called and gotten in the same day. If there's an urgent matter, I never have a problem getting in. I don't know what I'm going to do when he retires, because I have never had a doctor who listens to what I say, until I became a patient of his. Most male physicians don't LISTEN to their women patients...Dr. Caulkins does! "
1480,38755,1.0,"Very unhappy with service, paid cash no insurance, left in office for an hour before talking to the Doctor, had lab tests, office staff wont call back, have gone back for follow up tests. Again nurses or staff wont call me back with results, no call back, they take my message over and over and no call  back...they take my money but till no call back....moving on "
1481,38755,1.0,I hate it when a doctor doesn't believe what I say.  I wish I could find a good doctor that took me seriously. 
1482,38755,1.0,"able to get in on fairly short notice. very understanding, and seemed eager to help. did not seem to talk down, just a normal guy that is a very knowledgeable Doc "
1483,38755,1.0,"Dr.Caulkins & his staff are awesome.I have been seeing him for years now as well as my children.I recommend him to anyone who is looking for a good,kind,funny dr for themselves & their family.He has been there thru check ups,colds,prenancy,the loss of my daughter,the pregnancy & birth of my last son.I think hes a great dr.His staff are always friendly & cheerful.My kids love going to see him which makes appointments (especially ones with shots) so much easier to do.He listens to what you have to say & helps you make informed decisions regarding health issues.The best dr ive been to.  "
1484,38755,1.0,"The best doctor and staff I have ever used. My entire immediate and extended family has chosen him as our primary doctor. He provides excellent care and goes above and beyond in follow up care. He has supported and treated our family though caner, pregnancy, spider bites, broken bones, and much more.Both of my sons adore him and taking them to the doctor is a treat, not a chore. "
1485,38756,1.0,"FAITHFUL, PERSONABLE, CARING AND KIND.  BEEN WITH HIM SINCE 2000.  I LOVE TO SEE HIM, BUT HE SEEMS TO ALWAYS BE BEHIND, EVEN AT 8:00 IN THE MORNING, BY AT LEAST 1/2 TO 1 HOUR.  HE'S NOT CHEAP, BUT NOT SURE HOW THAT COMPARES TO OTHERS IN HIS FIELD. "
1486,38756,1.0,"Doctor wanted to do surgery, went and got a 2nd opinion, did not need surgery, just offloading in my shoes. I have been excellent. Made me feel like all he wanted to do was the surgery. Not help me.  "
1487,38756,1.0,Very nice staff and Doctor. Recommend him to anyone that needs a foot Dr.  
1488,38756,1.0,Wonderful Doctor! He is the nicest and caring man. He really treats his patients with kindness. 
1489,38757,2.0,Excellent. 
1490,38758,2.0, 
1491,38759,1.0,I find Dr. Cagle to be very involved with my treatment.  He listens and takes great notes even when I ramble off subject.  Keeps in contact with my Medical Provider.  Great &quot;bedside manner&quot;.  Includes me when deciding what meds I need and dosage amount.  
1492,38760,1.0,"Patient, courteous, and always willing to listen or try a new approach to feeling better.  What more could you ask for in a Dr&#63; "
1493,38760,1.0,WE LOVE THIS DR!!  I've been with him for more than 15 years.  He takes his patients seriously and always actively listens.  My husband and new baby are also patients.  I wouldn't trust anyone else with my child the way that I would Dr. Carlson.  
1494,38761,1.0,"Dr. Carter really shows his patients that he is interested in helping them lead independant lives. My son has CMT, a neuropathy, that causes him motor delays and pain. Finding pain control in a 5 year old is near impossible, yet Dr. Carter is open minded to consider every possiblity.  He knows so much about neuromuscular conditions it is very reassuring as a mother to have my son in his care. "
1495,38761,1.0,"I have never before had a doctor who is not only a leader in the field of neuromuscular diseases, but he cares so much about his patients.  I believe that he shows the same kind of compassion and genuine interest with all of his patients, as he does with me.  What would his CMT patients do without him&#63; "
1496,38761,1.0,I had seen several doctors before I saw Dr. Carter.  He was the only one that knew anything about my disease (Charcot Marie Tooth) and he was able to help me greatly. 
1497,38762,1.0,Exellent doctor. Understood my problem with correct diagnosis on the first visit. Has a large numbner of neuropathy patients and experience. Staff is kind.  I waited 3 mnoths to see him but definately worth it 
1498,38763,2.0,Great Osteopath 
1499,38764,1.0,"Having since been to other radiology clinics (due to provider referrals not personal choice), I can tell you that Dr. Case and his staff were amazing. He was very friendly and made us feel very comfortable from the moment he entered the room. He was incredibly detailed in his exam and the explanations he gave us.  I have and will continue to reccomend him and will go back for the next pregnancy. "
1500,38764,1.0,"Dr. Case made my high risk pregnancy easier.  He did all the ultra sounds, I never had a tech.  He took the time to answer all my questions and was concerned about me and my baby.  I would recommend him to anyone.  He made it so we felt like we knew our daughter before she was born.  "
1501,38764,1.0,"Kevin is the simply put, the best. His bedside manner is impeccable and his knowledge and experience is wihtout equal. "
1502,38764,1.0,"Cold as Ice, ruined our special day by being cold and irritable. If you must go to him do not take children with you or he will turn hostile. I cancelled my 20th week appointment and whent else where were I was treated as an equal. if you expect more from your doctor, good manners, warmth, friendliness and compassion he is definitely lacks even an ounce of each. "
1503,38764,1.0,Dr. Case made my complicated pregnancy a burden I could carry.  Each week I looked forward to our visits with him when he would boost my spirits and reassure us that all was still well with the baby.  He has such an incredible bedside manner and truely cares about his patients.  He is overflowing with knowledge about the developing baby and makes the ultrasound appointment such a great experience as he explains in great detail throughout.  Dr. Case is such a warm and caring individual.  I always felt like he was on our team in the effort to get our baby here safely.  I felt like I could really count on him to keep our best interests at heart.   What a great doctor! 
1504,38764,1.0,Dr. Case is by far the BEST Dr. I''ve ever come across.  He made our experience seeing our baby so memorable and special.   He was our favorite part of our 2 pregnancies.  He is so positive and wonderful.  He was so open and patient with our numerous questions.I recommend him all the time to every pregnant woman. 
1505,38764,1.0,"What an excellent person Dr. Case is!! He is not just a wonderful radiologist but also a great human being...you can see it in the way he talks to you: he is so respectful and caring and no question is too dumb or beneath him to answer (ask him about insurance, costs, appointments; and he'll answer them all!). He did all my ultrasounds for my pregnancy and you could see he was as moved as us when we saw our baby for the first time! He even had tips for how to develop a bond with our unborn child. We just loved him and his office staff! He is very prompt and detailed with his reports and will make sure you understand everything on there.  I only wish he were an OB-Gyn too in addition to being a radiologist!! "
1506,38765,1.0,Way too expensive and not worth it. Choose a different doctor. 
1507,38765,1.0,"This place is awful!  Everyone from reception to the nurses to the office manager to the doctor himself are rude and cold hearted and do no care about patients.  Dr. Cathcart does not take time to listen to concerns and doesn't care about follow up.  He does not care about people or their health at all. I was in severe pain due to my diabetes and called for help and they refused to help be becasue I had rescheduled an appointment.  They said rescheduling showed I didn't care about my health, so they refused to help.  I told them I had to reschedule due to work, and they would not get me an appoinment for 4 more months, but they refused to treat me.  This is against the doctor's oath.  DO  NOT GO HERE. "
1508,38765,1.0,"I am very disappointed.  I have been on thyroid medication for nearly 20 years and this is the first time I have had an issue.  What has happened is that I was referred to Dr. Cathcart and he changed my dosage of L-thyroxine to 112 mcg with instruction to stay on this dose for 12 weeks, then be rechecked.  When I was rechecked the order was to stay on the same dosage, but the prescription sent to the pharmacy was for 125 mcg.  When I questioned it the nurse stated that they have no record of my ever being on 112 mcg.  I faxed them the note I received 90 days ago and they did not respond.  I am stuck using an outdated dose of 112 mcg that was prescribed to me 2 years ago as I have run out of the prescription he from earlier this year and the pharmacist agreed that I should not take the higher dose.  I am extremely angry about this and will not see this physician again. "
1509,38765,1.0,"Dr. Cathcart will only prescribe synthetic T4.  He was biased, arrogant, and callous; he refused to listen to me or try anything else beyond T4.  He treats thyroid patients by TSH alone, rarely does he test Free T4 and will NOT test the thyroid’s active hormone T3 at all.  Consequently I got sicker and sicker.  Two friends say he is a good diabetes doctor, but thyroid dysfunction patients BEWARE!  He told me no one is allergic to T4 meds but I sure was sure allergic to something in the medications, which he refused to investigate.  Even after swelling up like an elephant and barely able to function he still refused to change my thyroid med; I had the same reaction to Synthroid, Levoxyl and Levothroid.  I ended up throwing the T4 meds away and improved enough to look for another doctor.   If I had stayed with him I would more likely than not be in a grave.  If you have thyroid disease and value your life, RUN from him.   I do NOT Recommend him! "
1510,38765,1.0,"Very efficient and thorough. Open minded, intelligent, friendly and helpful. Goes that one step further. "
1511,38766,1.0,"When working for the insurance giants, he writes what they need him to write. I spent less than 10 minutes being examined by him, his diagnosis was completely off base and contrary to the other specialists and experts I have seen.  "
1512,38766,1.0,"I have been seeing Dr. Champoux for 23 years for various reasons, but finally I allowed him to replace my damaged knee joint after I could no longer walk.  The outcome has been better than I would have expected considering the extent of the damage. He is kind, compassionate, and very knowledgeable. He takes the time to explain details and never rushes the appointment, or pushes you to make a decision. His calm relaxed manner is comforting. "
1513,38767,1.0,"He is polite, tactful and always focused on the best interest of the kids. "
1514,38768,0.0,. The only problem is that she is so popular that it can be hard to get a same day appointment 
1515,38769,1.0,"Dr Cassino is a great doctor.  I have seen and know many.  I am an ICU RN and this Dr knows his stuff.  Though he may be quiet, he listens very well and then thoughtfully gives his well informed answer. He might not actively converse when pt is describing all of their problems, that does not equate not listening, in fact just the opposite is true.  Stay fair and balanced please.  "
1516,38769,1.0,"I found Dr. Casino to be a fine doctor and refreshingly pragmatic.  True, he's not the mushy bleeding heart but that's fine with me, as I'm not seeing him for psychological issues or empathy.  I see him to treat my medical condition.  He's never cut me short nor hasn't listened.  Quite the opposite as I've found him to be a very active, thinking listener - not the egotist who likes to listen to himself.  I've seen him for nearly a year now and he's better than many doctors I've had in my 50+ years.  Regarding the other comments I saw, it might be someone doesn't take into account Dr. Casino has a different cultural background.  Given what life is like in the Philippines and what 3rd world afflictions he's likely seen in his training, it may be hard for him to genuinely empathize with issues far less serious in scope.  I see a man who does his job seriously when he sees you.  I also think it's his call to order a blood test, not you, unless you are your own doctor.  "
1517,38769,1.0,"When a store clerk or checker doesn't listen, that's one thing.  When your doctor doesn't listen, that is scary.  He is elsewhere when &quot;listening&quot;, not sure where, but it doesn't matter now does it.  Not rude nor arrogant, just a poor listener, which in this line of work, won't get you very far.  If you are unwilling to help me, that's fine, there are many doctors to choose from.  I had a pre-existing condition that my former doctor and now CMO of FHG had diagnosed.  Dr. Casino has now determined, without really ever examining my injury, that the former doctor was wrong and my prescription is not needed, although a specialist has scheduled an MRI based on an exam.  Keep looking.  "
1518,38769,1.0,"Dr. Casino has a terrible bedside manner and lacks knowledge or experience.  I can tolerate rude or insensitive Dr.'s when they know medicine, but the only examples he could offer were from lectures in Med school.  He completely disregarded labs that I requested (actually flat-out refused to order bloodwork that I felt should be done as a follow up to other labs (coupled with family history) and did not show an IOTA of sympathy over several major losses our family had just experienced. I thought that I was just seeing him on an &quot;off day&quot; as we all have those, but after 3 visits and several similar stories from friends and family who have gone to him, we all read the same conclusion.  Dr. Casino may evolve into a wonderful physician down the road.  But as of 2010, he is cold, impersonal, not at all interested in a good patient/Dr. relationship and not in the slightest bit interested in having his patients involved in their health care decisions.  "
1519,38770,2.0,"Best dentist I have ever been to! Thorough, knowledgeable and very up to date on the latest technology &amp; techniques.  "
1520,38770,2.0,"If you want cheap, this isn't the place for you. However, if you want knowledgeable care or cosmetic dentistry you will get excellent results. Dr. Chan stays current and does superb ceramics.  "
1521,38770,2.0,Dr Chan charges a premium but provides very poor service. Avoid this Dr. 
1522,38771,2.0,Dr Cavalieri is Awesome. Very Smart Man ;-) 
1523,38772,1.0,"I cannot recommend him highly enough. He is knowledgeable, helpful and and really listens to you. He solved health issues that many, many other doctors could not. "
1524,38773,1.0,"BEWARE! don't fall for this b.s.!  total sheister! running a &quot;dental cult&quot;and will tell you that you need and entire mouth restoration, especially if you have good insurance.  2 crowns installed, neither of which fit properly. a costly and very unrewarding experience.   for a dentist he has terrible breath! "
1525,38773,1.0,I had a crown break and got a reco from a co-worker.  Dr. Caggiano is great and his staff worked with my limited schedule and got a new crown back in four days.  No traveling oversees with a temporary-yeah!! I highly recommend this place.  
1526,38775,1.0,SUPER EXPENSIVE!!!  Not always happy with work - have needed to go back too often to have things repeated. Back office staff unpleasant. We finally changed dentists - and it seems several other friends who used his services have as well. Keep looking....  
1527,38776,1.0,"Dr Campbell is very helpful and knollegable, and his office staff are always nice. "
1528,38776,1.0,"GREAT! I am back to work, My back and neck are all better. He is the best Chiropractor I have ever had. "
1529,38777,1.0,Like others Dr Cairns has taken care of me for years. He is always so patient with me. He has seen me through some serious health issues over the years. He's just the best all around.  
1530,38777,1.0,"Dr. Cairns has treated me for years. As others have said, he never rushes you through an appointment and is very happy to answer my questions. He has an excellent bedside manner whether it's treatment during hospitalization or just a check-up in his office. I can't recommend him highly enough.  "
1531,38777,1.0,"Dr. Cairns is the best doctor I have been to.  I am never &quot;rushed&quot; through an appointment, as he takes the time to listen to any and all problems.  Very personable with a great sense of humor.   All of this is a huge plus in this day and age! "
1532,38777,1.0,This is a great doctor. I've seen him for many years and he always takes the best care of me. 
1533,38777,1.0,Staff was very helpful and Dr Cairns took the time to understand my issue without cutting right to the diagnosis. He made sure he understood all symptoms and concerns before beginning a diagnosis. 
1534,38777,1.0,Very caring and kind doctor with a wonderful bedside manner. He takes the time to research your information before talking with you.  
1535,38777,1.0,"Very good doctor. Very courteous, professional and he has a good bedside manner. He's also very kind and good at explaning information and he's also very up to date on the latest HIV information/treatments.  "
1536,38778,1.0,"he cares about  people and does his best for his patients, kind to his nursing staff and to his patients and he does his best as a doctor.  "
1537,38778,1.0,Dr.Casebeer has been very helpful with all issues I have had regarding my health.However Dr. if you are reading this &quot; listening is one of the most important skill's any one can develope&quot;.  
1538,38779,1.0,Excellent advice and care given.  My health has improved tremendously since I changed doctors to see him.  His nursing staff is great.  There is a separate appointment desk and I've never had to wait too long to get one.  He spends time with patients so is often not on time for appointments.  Take a book. 
1539,38780,2.0,great ER doctor 
1540,38781,1.0,"The best.  Kind, professional, and very helpful.  Very well educated, down to earth, not pretentious, and very direct, but in a very helpful way. "
1541,38781,1.0,"Dr. Phil Capp was able to see me immediately when my primary doc (Monica Mayhill) was totally booked.  He is friendly, funny, and personable, very direct and thorough.  I felt very comfortable, even though I typically do not see male doctors for girly stuff.  I was able to get my immediate needs taken care of, and then he assessed what other (also important) issues I had were.  We were able to do blood tests and he counseled me on quitting smoking (which I did, after ten years), and I left feeling well taken care of and very happy with the customer service at Swedish.  Great place.  I recommend this office to everyone I talk to about doctor stuff! "
1542,38781,1.0, 
1543,38782,1.0,"Love Dr. Cassidy!  Been going here for 14 years... I moved away a couple years ago but still drive here because they're that good.  Dr. Cassidy often goes to conferences &amp; stays up to date on the latest in eye care, which is nice to know.  They always have stylish eye glass options as well &amp; are very helpful in making sure you have the right fit. "
1544,38782,1.0,Dr. Steve was called on a Saturday because something was irratating my only eye.  I had lost my other eye in a acdcident years before. He held up his Saturday golf game to treat me.  Something has abraded the pupil and was casing much pain and reduced vision. This visit took about 45 min. with good results. He called that night to see how I was doing and another call Sunday morning to say he wanted me to stop by his office Monday morning for a further check up.  Thank heavens for caring health care practioners like Dr. Steve and Walt Cassidy @ Issaquah Vision. 
1545,38783,1.0,Dr. Carmick has a registered sex offender working for him at his front desk. She was convicted and charged. Now she gets to work with YOUR sons.(www.kitsapsun.com) 2009 
1546,38783,1.0,"My experience is that Dr. Carmick is  gem. While his office tends to get backed up, I'd say he gives a  lot of personal attention, which takes more time. He is a fountain of information and probably the most informed dermatologist I have ever met. I would double check with him even on seemingly unrelated issues and he is the first doctor that pops into my mind when I need answers. When visiting a doctor, it is either because you are not well or need a solution and either way, maybe your attitude is the problem and not the doctor. He is one of the more qualified doctors I have had to pleasure to find.  "
1547,38783,1.0,Not recommend him to anyone--insensitive. 
1548,38784,1.0,"Dr. Chan is very Knowledgable. His bedside manor needs some work, be he does care about his patients and is very nice. If he does not know about a particular topic he is the first to abmitt it and to send you to a specialist. Dr. Chan is a great doctor.  "
1549,38785,0.0,"I've been seeing Dr. Cardwell for 15 years.  She has delivered both my children, done emergency surgery on me, and done regular annual exams.  Best ob/gyn I've ever seen. "
1550,38785,0.0,I have seen Dr. Cardwell for several years.   She is attentive - listens well - answers all questions.  She is compassionate and caring with a sense of humor.  I have referred many women to her and they were also happy.  She is an amazing physician in my view. PS I am NOT the easiest patient to manage....  she is amazing. 
1551,38785,0.0,I requested her help in treating a somewhat emergent situation with a previously established patient and Dr. Cardwell refused to care for this person. 
1552,38785,0.0,"I am not hysterical, nor am I an overly emotional person.  I had an awful experience with Dr. Cardwell.  She was so detached and un-personable that my husband and I actually walked out of her office mid-appointment.  She did not seem capable of understanding that her laptop was less important than our questions and concerns with respect to our first pregnancy.  I would never recommend that anyone go to Dr. Cardwell.  "
1553,38785,0.0,"I'm almost seven months pregnant and have only seen Dr. Cardwell twice. The first time she spent 5 min with me and the second time maybe ten. I agree she has no emotion and is totally uninterested in knowing me at all. I'm glad I'm not the only one who feels this way, I will not be wasting anymore of my money or time on her anymore.  "
1554,38785,0.0,"I have had both my children with dr. Cardwell and will be going back to have my third with her! She is great, very straight to the point and she doesn't sugar coat things. Love all the staff at her office. "
1555,38785,0.0,"I have been Dr. Cardwell's patient for over 18 years. She is always friendly and extremely professional, taking time to answer all my questions. If not for her, I would be dead. She found my rare thyroid cancer (medulary carcinoma) when 7 other doctors overlooked it. I can't offer enough words of gratitude for her thorough and curious approach to medicine. Mindy, Kirkland, WA.  "
1556,38785,0.0,"Dr. Carwell is an excellent OB/GYN.  No, we didn't become &quot;best friends&quot; in the 9 months I saw her during my pregnancy.  However, she never gave me reason to doubt her knowledge and skill.  My pregnancy was complicated but I felt completely at ease under her care.  I would definitley recommend her to anyone who is down to earth and looking for a highly skilled OB/GYN with a lot of experience.  "
1557,38785,0.0,"True that Dr. Cardwell is emotionally reserved, but she is an excellent OBGYN.  If you have an excitable and/or hysterical personality, I agree that she would not be a good fit.  "
1558,38785,0.0,"Dr. Cardwell is a terrible OB/GYN if you have anything other than a perfect pregnancy.  She is detached, unfeeling, and will treat you like a neurotic if you bring up any concerns you have during pregnancy.  I will never return to her office.  Her ultrasound technician bruised my belly repeatedly even after telling her to stop.  Her nurses never returned phone calls with important test results, which left me taking an unnecessary medication whose side effect can be sterility or death.  Her nurse practitioner tried to convince me that I was two weeks further along than I knew I was, thus moving up my due date, making it much more likely that I would need to induce labor.  DO NOT GO TO DR. CARDWELL! "
1559,38785,0.0,"If you're a mountain woman who doesn't have human emotion, Dr. Cardwell would be a perfect doctor for you.  But if, like most women, you have questions, concerns, and feelings, she is probably not the right doctor for you.  She is obviously a competent physician, but Dr, Cardwell really is not good at connecting with her patients. "
1560,38785,0.0,I have seen Dr. Cardwell for 8 years for annual exams and perimenopausal symptoms.  I would not consider seeing another gynocologist.  She has been careful and conservative in her care and always takes the time necessary to answer my questions and provide age-appropriate information that a woman should consider.  
1561,38785,0.0,Dr. Cardwell was my ob/gyn when I was pregnant with my daughter. I had a very easy pregnancy and no complications.  When it was time to deliever that is when all hell broke lose. I almost died. Nobody ever gave me a clear explanation of what happened but there are certain things that they should have told me when i went to the hospital. My daughter was not positioned to be delievered naturally and Dr. Cardwell and the nurses at the hospital did not tell me that until the last possible minute. From what I have learned by reading that is something that a Dr should know.  I went to hell and back (3 operations in 20 days) and I partly blame Dr. Cardwell. As result I can't have any more children.  
1562,38785,0.0,"I first met Dr Cardwell when I was 35 weeks pregnant, I was rushed to the emergency room when my midwives couldn't find our daughters heartbeat. Dr Cardwell was the one to give us the sad news that our baby girl had passed away in utero. Dr Cardwell listened to me and even though I asked for something that isn't normally up to the patient to decide, she really listened to what I had to say, and took my feelings into account. I have been with Dr Cardwell since that day 3 1/2 years ago, and I am happy to say that now she is our OB for my current pregnancy. It feels great knowing that I am seeing a Dr that will not only truly listen to what I have to say, but also take into account that I am an adult, and I know my body and my own limits. I will always be greatful to her for that, and I am so excited for her to deliver this baby! And I love her nurse Tanya! "
1563,38785,0.0,"Dr Cardwell was my second OB for my pregnancy. She was GREAT! I love her very calming and jovial attitude and how much compassion she has for her patients. I never waited in the lobby and the staff was so helpful, polite and very friendly. I has a very bad experience across the street at another provider so I was so relieved to find this gem! "
1564,38785,0.0,"Dr. Cardwell and all the staff at Evergreen Women's Clinic have been great. My first visit was to determine if I was entering early menopause at age 38 due to several symptoms I had been experiencing. After it was determined I was likely not entering early menopause, my husband and I decided to conceive our first child. We mis-carried the the first pregnanacy at 3 months and Dr. Cardwell performed the D&C.; The care I received from discovery of the mis-carriage to the recovery from the D&C; was wonderful during this difficult time. I am now 8 1/2 months pregnant and everything has gone well. I like Dr. Cardwell's no-nonsense style and straight-forward approach. She listens to the patient's needs, questions and concerns and seems to take a conservative approach to medicine. I have never felt forced into making a medical decision that I was not comfortable with. I am confident that Dr. Cardwell will help delivery our child successfully no matter what medical issues may arise.  "
1565,38785,0.0,"Problem #1: Did not meet doctor at first appointment, only the nurse. Problem #2: The second appointment a technician conducted a screening test. Dr. Cardwell confirmed the results were outside &quot;normal&quot; limits and referred us to a specialist. The specialist could not duplicate the results found by Dr. Cardwell's office. The specialist informed us that this was very rare and she didn't get to give &quot;good news&quot; very often. Hence, the results from Dr. Cardwell's office were completely wrong. The next day a nurse from Dr. Cardwell's office called to say that their number was wrong because of the machine and it was &quot;very common&quot; to misread the ultrasound because of the machine. She also continued to give me the results of the incorrect test which were &quot;positive for Down syndrome&quot; even though a screeing test cannot show positive results. It can only show that we are at an increase of risk. I am very disappointed by the care from this office and how unprofessionally this mistake was handled. "
1566,38786,1.0,"Dr. Cassius is a kind, caring and compassionate Doctor. He is very talented and has helped to relieve my pain. He is a very thoughtful physician who takes the time out to get to know his patients and truly understand their pain. "
1567,38786,1.0,"he was rude, unprofessional. Left me feeling very belittled - almost abused. Would not go back to this doctor. "
1568,38786,1.0,"Very good doctor who I recommend to anyone with sport injury, back/spine pain, shoulder, knee injuries.  "
1569,38786,1.0,"Although I had to wait I did not mind as he took his time and is very very thorough. One reason he runs late is he tries to fit in patients that call in at the last minute because they are in pain. Dr. Cassius will refer out to other Dr's.  not in his field and they have always been top notch.  I have referred him to others and they are very very satisfied also.  He identified a thyroid problem, sent me to Dr. Murray and I have been almost pain free since.  Just take a book to read.  "
1570,38786,1.0,disrespect for patients schedule by running often times more than an hour late!!! Nice man but can't trust someone who appears to be very disorganized and scattered! 
1571,38786,1.0,"Dr. Cassius is a kind, caring man. He'll do whatever he can to fit you into his schedule and he takes all insurance plans. He uses trigger point injections to relieve pain while the patient works in PT to strengthen those areas. In theory, this should allow the patient to work to regain function with minimal pain. NB: There isn't a consensus on what constitutes a trigger point nor is trigger point theory accepted by the medical community at large. This doesn't mean that it doesn't work. Cassius also attempts to help patients reduce/eliminate the amt of pain meds taken however this may increase patients' pain levels. It's not unusual to wait an hour to see him which he says is due to being thorough with every patient. This doesn't explain why he is routinely an hour late for his first appointment of the day. He hasn't always carefully checked into the background of his referrals. At one point, he unknowingly referred patients to a practitioner who wasn't registered to practice in WA. "
1572,38786,1.0,Very interested and caring manner. Effective treatment and suggestions.  Would recommend him highly.  
1573,38787,2.0,Took time to figure out what was really wrong. Short wait. 
1574,38787,2.0,"Bad bedside manner. Seemed very rushed. Lots of grimacing, which was bizarre. "
1575,38788,0.0,"While Dr. Cain no longer takes new patients she is an excellent resource for other psychiatrists she respects. See Dr. Phillip Lindsey As her patient for 13 years I find her honest, open, extremely knowledgable over a wide range of medicine so that she provides excellent recommendations to other specialty physicians.  "
1576,38789,0.0,"Dr. Carter is ver knowledgeable and very helpful.  Unfortunately, she is rarely available on a short notice basis such as when I get ill.  "
1577,38789,0.0,Dr. Carter is excellant but be prepared to have to butt into the conversation at times. You should also have a prepared list of questions with you. A family member to listen in is also a good idea.  
1578,38790,1.0,Very impressed.   Glad I chose him to help straighten out my meds! 
1579,38790,1.0,"If you don't like being patted on the back, i.e, like honesty from someone who knows what they're doing, Dr Chalem is right for you. He also has an interesting technique in terms of how keeps records of sessions. It weirded me out at first, but the I realized it's the best idea ever. PS A regular hour-long appointment with no insurance is around 215 for an hour "
1580,38791,1.0,Dr. Carlson is an excellent surgeon and is a very helpful and knowledgeable doctor.  He is very good with people.  
1581,38792,0.0,"I have been a patient of Dr Carkin's for over 8 yrs.  She has been instrumental in keeping my quality of life at an acceptable level in spite of my severe RA &amp; Fibromyalgia (along with other health issues). As a health care provider for over 24 yrs, I know a good doctor when I see one. Dr Carkin has an excellent bed-side manner, is compassionate, caring, knowledgeable, and her nurse is always able to get me in to see her when it is urgent. If I ever move away, I will fly back to Seattle (if I am physically able) to see her every 2 months like I am currently seeing her. My brother-in-law needs to find a good rheumatologist in Houston &amp; cannot find one as good as Dr Carkin. I recommend her to ANYONE who needs an experienced rheumatologist.  "
1582,38792,0.0,I have seen Dr. Carkin for at least 12 years.  I do medical research for myself and others as a consumer advocate and as a healthcare provider myself.  Dr. Carkin has proven consistently to be remarkable in all aspects of the care I have received.  She is an amazing physician...it is no wonder she is again and again rated as one of Washington's TOP DOCTORS. 
1583,38792,0.0,"I was referred to Dr. Carkin by a well-meaning, kind hearted neurologist. I was not well under her care and left. Upon my leaving, Dr. Carkin became enraged. She was dishonest, attacking my character and intentions. I was unable to defend myself due to my illness. This traumatic experience caused me to pull away from western medicine. I've been trying to work with a GP while learning alternative ways of treatment but my condition has worsened. My hope for healing is waining as my illness advances. This site says to remember that we are liable for what we write here. I accept my reponsibilities.  Where is it written here that this dr is liable for her lack of professionalism, heavy-handed behavior, and for the appalling disgrace she bestowed upon her profession&#63; "
1584,38792,0.0,"As a Lupus patient with serious CNS involvement who was having seizures and strokes, for nearly 20 years Dr. Carklin worked tirelessly on my behalf. No matter how difficult the problems I faced, she always made me feel &quot;we&quot; were facing them together - and that we would find the right treatment plan to do so. She is a skilled physician - highly reccommended to me by several other physicians - and yet she never hesitated to seek advice from and work with the best neurologist or other specialists when needed. My family felt totaly confident whe was the best doc to care for me. We always knew that not only was her care skilled - she also really cared about me as a person and a patient.  I have now moved some 70 miles away and am searching for a new doc - it will be very difficult to find someone to fill her shoes! "
1585,38792,0.0,"Thank you for asking about this wonderful doctor. I have fibromyalgia and had suffered for 15 years before getting refered to Dr. Carkin. She is responsive, caring, and very informed about my illness. She helped me understand that it is vital that I follow her instructions to exercise, sleep, and eat properly. She has included my family in my care and, whether I am feeling my best or not, she is the most non-judgemental, kind person. Her staff is wonderful. I am always treated warmly and with respect. In my experience, anyone that leaves her care would have to have problems unrelated to physical illness. Thank you, Dr. Carkin, for your commitment, intelligence, and your amazing ability to heal.  "
1586,38792,0.0,"Julie Carkin has been my doctor for nearly 10 years, ever since i was diagnosed with my illness at 18 years old and i could not ask for a better doctor. Not only does she care about me and my complicated illness, but she is warm and caring to my family-which means alot to me. No matter what Dr. Carkin has always shown me that she is always there for me. She is a very smart, caring person and i trust her with anything. I would never think about seeing another doctor. "
1587,38793,1.0,"There were several questionable things that happened immediately before and during the operation.  When I asked the doctor questions about the issues, he became rude and abrasive. He ducked and dodged the questions and even insulted by wife. "

1589,38794,2.0,.  
1590,38795,1.0,"Best chiropractor I have ever seen and I have been treated by at least 15 of the best in different parts of the U.S.. He has amazing skills, cares, and delivers on his promises when he says he can help. Absolutely the best at treating the spine and sports injuries to ankles, knees and wrists. "
1591,38796,1.0,All of the procedures were covered by Ins. Dr. Chabal has helped me with more ideas and helpful medications than any Doctor I have ever seen for my sciatic nerve pain. He is very willing to take time to explain things to me and he has a friendly and empathetic personality. i have enjoyed being under his care for the last year and a half.

1593,38797,0.0, 
1594,38797,0.0,This Dr over medicated me .I went into mania and she put me in Psychiatric hosp and then she skipped town she also did another patient the same way we became friends in the psy hosp and Dr. canning did us both the same way . 
1595,38797,0.0,I would never recommend this Dr. She violates dr/patient confidentiality and does everything she can to convince you and your family that your are suicidal so she can put you in the hospital. I have heard similar stories from numerous former patients. 
1596,38797,0.0,"Dr. Canning made very personal accusations against my character, and even accused me of not taking the Depakote she prescribed to me. I was later diagnosed bipolar and followed followed accordingly by 3 other physchologists. One of my psychiatrists told me that people metabolize different medications differently, and that was not appropriate for her to make that accusation. I also have to add that an attorney in town told us that she was a quack and had been run out of town since I moved onto another pysician. "
1597,38798,0.0,"Dr. Rowin Cantrell is Intelligent, observant, and extremely kind. She diagnosed me correctly and expertly and has obvious expertise in her field. She is a compassionate person and physician, and I am pained to see these negative reviews of her. "
1598,38798,0.0,"I went to Dr. Cantrell for bipolar I treatment. I was going downhill fast and knew it. Instead, she said I could see her in a month for a 15 min. med check. When I told her I wanted to see her earlier, she said two weeks. Her appointment included me doing math problems in my head and remembering dates--this after she had clearly run out of things to ask me. She had her head in her notebook the entire time. No compassionate listening. I've seen a lot of doctors in my day and never have I felt so belittled or bewildered. Two weeks later I was an even bigger mess, got no help and cried as I left her office. I saw another doctor as soon as possible. He sent me on a month-long stay in the mental hospital. There, I worked with a team of doctors and each one said that in my fragile state I needed intensive, long-term treatment. More than six months later, I still see my doctors every week. How such a well trained doctor could miss this--and with me begging for help!--is remarkable. "
1599,38798,0.0,"Most of us looking for a good psychiatrist are seeking someone who is caring and compassionate.  Dr. Cantrell just doesn't have these qualities and is astonished to find out that patients think she lacks what is takes to be a good psychiatrist. Somehow I wasn't surprised to see that she was &quot;astonished&quot; to find out that she has no perception of how she comes across to her patients - or those who stick around for more.  I moved on and feel so great having someone who is truly caring.  Dr. Cantrell, you just don't see yourself as your patients see you.  You are in the wrong profession.  "
1600,38798,0.0,"I am absolutely stunned by these comments. and yes I did rate myself. I have always scheduled a full 25 minutes for my patients regardless of their insurance. I have often discounted my rates for patients who cant pay the full rate. I strive to return all phone calls same day or at least within 24 hours. I am available 24/7 for urgent matters on my personal cell phone. I often return phone calls on Saturday and Sundays if I haven't reached a patient on friday.I run on time and respect my patients time. I am a highly qualified UCLA trained physician and I care deeply about my patients, their suffering and the serious stigma patients with mental illness have to cope with. I strive to be the most helpful and knowledgeable physician I can be and am constantly reading and learning so I can improve my practice. I believe that physicians should have the same opportunity to defend their reputations on these websites as patients have the opportunity to damage them. Respectfully Rowin Cantrell "
1601,38798,0.0,"This psychiatrist is rude, impatient and condescending. She always acts as though she can't wait for you to finish the session so she can get on with better things. Since most people going to a psychiatrist are having emotional problems, I would suggest you avoid this doctor as she makes it very clear that you are just a nuisance. There are psychiatrists out there who know what they're doing and provide support. She is not one of them.  "
1602,38798,0.0,"I was prescribed a sustained release anti-depressant and told to take it once a day...It only lasts for 12 hours in its sustained release version - you do the math... I was also given a large dose of an extremely addictive sleep medicine, from which I am still in withdrawal two months later. I was treated rudely when I called the doctor in a very vulnerable state on a weekend. I would not advise anybody in a fragile psychiatric state to visit this doctor. "

1605,38801,0.0,"she should not even be consider as a &quot;care provider&quot;, what she has provided to me as her patient only frusturation, discouragement, carelessness, ingnorance, etc. She never cared what my lab results were and how am I doing or feeling throughout my pregnancy and even during delivery. A week before my due date she told me that she will be very upset if I'll have contractions and will call her on the day of the football game. At first I thought she was kidding but then I realized she was totally serious. Even though I end up delivering my baby the next day after the football game she still wasn't with me the whole time during my labor, my nurse bless her heart was with me 99.9% during the delivery and almost delivered my baby. I guess Dr. got a chance to catch my baby when it came out. I would never ever recomend her to anybody.  "
1606,38801,0.0,"Love her! She has been my daughters doctor since she was born &amp; always takes the time to answer my questions. Her nurse is great, always responds quickly when I call with questions. I liked her so much I decided to go to her with my second pregnancy. "

1610,38803,1.0, 
1611,38803,1.0,"Don't go here. He doesn't listen to what you have to say. I felt like it was an inconvenience for him to have to see me or try to diagnose my problem. He never answers any of my questions(but he has no problem answering his cell phone during one of my exams) and tells me what I already know. His bedside manner is terrible, and he never looks you in the face when he talks do you, just seems overall uninterested. The front office and phone staff are also very rude. I have had several bad experiences over the years I have been a patient there and this was the last straw. If you want a doctor who is caring and thorough do not go to Dr. Chaffee. "
1612,38803,1.0,Dr Chaffee is easy to work with but you need to know what your issue is. Very nice mannered man and seems very genuine.

He is very scientific and seems young and geeky, but I found him to have a very warm heart and surprisingly good bedside manner. He took great interest in getting to the heart of my condition and was in constant contact with the pathologist, always keeping me in the loop in progression of my health. He also participated in a very difficult surgery from which I recovered quickly. If you need a GI in Seattle I would recommend Chris wholeheartedly.  "
1619,38807,1.0,it seems this dr has minimal time to look into issues of my dx.  he just gives me a vague answer and thats the end of it.  i have become very unimpressed with his care lately.  i have asked about issues and he just brushes me off. 
1620,38807,1.0,"Dr. Caldwell is a very patient, friendly, and easy man to deal with. In my book, he's a class act. Would recommend him to anyone. "
1621,38807,1.0,Wonderful doctor who listens to his patient.  Very knowlegeable. Saved my son's life by giving him the MRI that diagnosed his brain tumor when no-one but my son believed he had one. 
1622,38807,1.0,He is a pretty good Doctor. Have went many years. Their are also very good ones in that same practice. 
1623,38807,1.0,Great doctor. Very good with allergy related problems especially. 
1624,38808,2.0, 
1625,38809,1.0,"I like the way Dr. Chan and his staff treat patients. My previous dentist died in a traffic accident and that is how I got referred to Dr. Chan by a friend of mine. I definitely feel the difference by comparison. At Dr. Chan's office, I know what options I have and I am not pushed for the most expensive option at all. His staff, Pam and Lisa, for example, treats patients very friendly and kindly. They explain what they are going to do in details and clearly. They are just happy professional people who love what they do.  "
1626,38809,1.0,"Caring, professional, patient and skilled. His work is first class. You will never feel rushed and will often wonder if there are any other patients in the office at the same time as you. His office staff are all very friendly. You will like the lit candles in the waiting room and the leather hygienist's chair. His rates are less than other dentists I have seen. "
1627,38810,1.0,Excellent. Very knowledgeable about my condition. Efficient and thorough and answered all my questions.  
1628,38810,1.0,"Had to force him to do angiogram even after strong family history. Day of angio was sure there was nothing wrong...boy was he wrong heart surgery next day. Could have saved me the surgery had he did the test years earlier when I asked. My brother is an internal medicine Dr. and wanted the test done but he refused until I begin to have chext pain and needed 6 arteries  bypassed and some valve work also. Trying to save money for the company..maybe they get bonuses at the end of the year. Both of my brothers, my father and my grandfather had heart attacks with out any early warnings in their early 50's. Grandfather died of heart failure at 49.  "
1629,38811,1.0,He is the best most caring Doctor I have ever encountered.  I have a serious illness and he has taken implicit care of all my needs and concerns 
1630,38812,1.0,"Doctor Campbell was on time, was very friendy and knowledable. I highly suggest going to him.  "
1631,38813,2.0,.  
1632,38813,2.0,. Brilliant african american female 
1633,38814,2.0,Very excellent dentist and noticed other problems in the future. Very reasonable rates. Very personable and friendly dentist. Highly approve! 
1634,38815,1.0,my family has seen dr carter for the last 10 years or so. he has always been a very kind man sometimes you have to wait when you want the best.  
1635,38815,1.0,I have only seen Dr. Carter at the hospital during testing and on one occasion he said somethings that were very insensitive. All the appointment in the office I saw Pat and Pat and the office personal where great. 
1636,38815,1.0,"Dr Carter is the best GI doctor I have encountered.He is the doctor other doctors seek.He is extremely up to date in his field.The down side is he &quot;takes his time&quot; with his patients.I personally find this a plus when you are the patient and need the extra time.once you are established, You will be seen in a timely manner.I would highly recommend him.  "
1637,38816,0.0,Dr. Carter was absolutely great with my daughter! He is her favorite doctor and really helped during a tough illness.  
1638,38817,1.0,"I had a EMG nerve conduction study, Dr. Cancado was very attentive, explain what was going to happen, listened to my concern &amp; was very plesant to talk to.  I would go back to him again.  The office staff was wonderful &amp; very nice.  "
1639,38818,1.0,Look up his nursing license number and see why his license was suspended for 5 years. He is a sick man that should not be able to practice medicine. Go the WA state Department of Health to take a look at his record. 
1640,38818,1.0,I've been with him for 18 years & I'm still here & haven't had a reoccurrance. Very efficient & thorough. Always answers my questions.  
1641,38819,0.0,This is the most amazing doctor I have ever worked with. I would be her patient in a heartbeat if she were practicing in my area and I would drive long distances to see her. Her relationship with her patients is amazing and her knowlege and special care and attention to detail is exceptional. 
1642,38820,1.0,"My long time PCP referred me to this dr.  I have a much older L/surgery that was performed on me when I was quite young, and has deteriorated badly as I've aged.  I was hoping dr would discuss my condition & possibly refer me to PT or create SOME plan.  I was wrong.  He is pompous, dismissive,rude and condescending.  He critisized the methods for surgery performed, and not in a commiserating manner.  He rarely made eye contact with me.  Ended the banner visit by prescribing me an anti-inflammatory rx that he tossed on the table on his way out that has been removed from the market now.  He informed me he couldn't do anything to help, and I assumed correctly he had no desire to.  I relayed the events of the visit to my PCP, and was told it was obvious he didn't want the bother.  May have been different if I had a broken bone.  Very disappointing.  Felt very bad when I left.  Don't see this dr if you don't have a sports injury or similar. "
1643,38820,1.0,"He is beyond excellent in all respects. Had three surgeries on my Achilles. It is perfect today, no problems. Highly reccomend him.  "
1644,38820,1.0,I have worked with Dr Carlson for almostr 3 years now. He took over a very complicated injury and saw it through to completion. I like his style and his knowledge of his specialty. I am willing to refer people to him due to his expertise. 
1645,38821,2.0,I have been seeing Dr. Caso for well over a year for implants on both sides of my mouth. A situation I have ignored for close to 10years so it was a big job. The staff and the doctor here are wonderfully upbeat and conscientious. I LOVE GOING HERE.  I love my regular dentist but I am going to be sad going back and not coming here! 
1646,38822,1.0,Dr Carey is a very compassionate and understanding doctor.  He always takes time to listen to me. I feel very fortunate to have him as my doctor.   I have been with him for twelve years. 
1647,38822,1.0,"Dr. Carey has been our family doc for 20 years & he's incredible! He's very caring, explains things well & treats the 'whole' person. Believes in some holistic treatments (i.e., exercise). Takes costs of medications into consideration if alternatives are possible & will refer to good specialists if necessary.  "
1648,38823,0.0,Very helpful and knowledgeable. She answered all of my concerns. Would definitely recommend her to my friends and family.  
1649,38823,0.0,"Wonderful doctor, wonder staff and office.  Will definitely return. "
1650,38823,0.0, 
1651,38825,0.0," My wife called Dr. Fan after finding him on the internet.  Dr. Fan answered the phone and spent the next 20 minutes speaking with her and providing her with excellent advice.  He even gave us his personal cell and home phone number in case we needed to speak with him and encouraged us to call anytime.  During our appointments, Dr. Fan patiently listened to our concerns and answered all our questions throughout my wife's pregnancy (and we had many as we are first time parents).  He made us feel extremely comfortable and confident throughout the entire process.  Dr. Fan also delivered our son at Overlake Medical Centre in Bellevue and visited my wife several times during her 3 day stay at the hospital.  We have never met any other doctor who is so knowledgeable, professional and caring as Dr. Fan.  We will be sure to contact Dr. Fan again when we prepare for our second child!  Thank you Dr. Fan for everything! "
1652,38829,2.0," Used VSP-Just paid small co-pay. Nice office. Easy parking. Friendly staff. Doc was great about answering my questions! Office was busy but they took the time with me, so I didn't feel rushed. "
1653,38830,2.0," I was on time for my very early morning appointment.  After initial prep by the nurse (blood pressure, etc) I was told that Dr. Fang had meetings all day.  Sorry, you will have to come in another time.  Twenty-five additional patients had to be rescheduled.  Very irresponsible to say the least.  "
1654,38833,1.0, Dr. Falk greatly cares about all his patients.  You can feel that he is concerned about your total health and has gone above and beyond my expectations to help me take charge of my health and well being. 
1655,38833,1.0, Dr.Falk is wonderful. Easy to get I'm after you hurt yourself.  Everyone we have sent to him agreed that he wants you better And clearly he loves his work. 
1656,38843,0.0," Dr Beth is amazing, I can not recommend her enough. She is non-judgmental to our choice to selectively vaccinate, she listens and she cares. Dr. Beth will actually sit down with you in her office and get to know you and your lifestyle. When did your doctor do that&#63; Recently, I took a tumble and Dr. Beth was able to give me stitches and I did not have to wait in a waiting room and my wound healed amazingly. Since Dr. Beth is an LM she can give women their annual exams in a very comfortable, laid back environment and she can deliver babies as well. Dr. Beth has a great bedside manner and manages to make everyone feel comfortable and laugh. I love the fact that she does not immediately go to antibiotics but to tinctures. I feel so blessed to have found Dr. Beth and know that my family is getting the best care at her office. "
1657,38854,1.0," Dr. Fabiano is a wonderful and caring physician.  He definately has had his challenges with nurses, but that is controlled by the clinic and hospital.  We couldn't ask for a more skilled physician.  We are very lucky to have him.  "
1658,38854,1.0, We've had Dr. Fabiano as our family doctor for several years now and he has given us excellent care. 
1659,38854,1.0," Dr Fabiano and his staff person before they made her life miserable and she decided to check out other pastures where incredible. Of course now he has gone through 4 other staff people and they are incredibly horible.  But Dr. Fabiano himself is caring, knowledgible, and listens to patients and family members, infact if it had not been for him and the earlier staff person, you know who you are, saved my husbands life because they where alert to the crisis that was overtaking his body and acted quickly and professionally.  "
1660,38854,1.0, Never on time. Has gone through many nurses. He is always rushed and doesn't listen. The clinic and hospital aren't very well ran.  
1661,38863,1.0, found his bedside manner to be very ubrupt and rude.  he was not sympathetic or understanding in the least.  
1662,38863,1.0, Dr. Faloon is a wonderful doctor who is very knowledgeable in what he's doing. I'd definitely go back to jim. Top notch in his field.  
1663,38863,1.0," Told me I needed to do stretches and never took additional x-rays beyond what the ER provided on a dislocated and subsequently reset kneecap.  As it turned out, the kneecap was broken and medial retinaculum was detached (nothing that would ever be solved by stretching anything), but that wasn't discovered by Faloon...  It was discovered by a doc in Cali who took an x-ray and it was obvious.  &quot;Do these stretches, your knee just needs strengthening&quot; was just wrong, and painful.  "
1664,38863,1.0," He doesn't do a good job of communicating, but he is a good surgeon. "
1665,38863,1.0, NO bed side manner what so ever. Does not answer any of you med. questions. 
1666,38874,1.0, GREAT Surgeon!  He does no Harm!! He spends the time to explain what the problem is and the treatment.  Surgery went w/o complications and painfree after 40 years!! 
1667,38874,1.0," I love Dr. Falicov!! He did a knee reconstruction when no one would even make an appointment with me. He did a minimally invasive neck surgery and now he is going to do a minimally invasive spine surgery. He is busy, but he is the BEST. Todd is almost as good. If you need to see Todd, dont' be disappointed - he confers with Dr. Falicov. Nicki is wonderful - they all are.  I just can't say enough! I've sent about 6 co workers to them and everyone has gotten better, with out surgery "
1668,38874,1.0," Not helpful, very mean and rude.  I see others with L+I found him unhelpful.  He will not do anything for people with back pain, in which there isn't many objective findings on mri's.  Won't even refer to physical therapy.  Try a chiropractor, like Brian Chan in Renton, helpful, and will try alternative treatment with help for L+I claims.  "
1669,38874,1.0," Dr. Falicov came highly recommended to me by a friend who had a 4 level fusion &amp; flatback correction 11/10. My husband &amp; I came from Eugene to talk to him about my situation. We found the staff to be very friendly &amp; helpful. Even though we waited to see him, he took his time to listen to what we had to say, we viewed the films I'd sent in advance per his personally emailing me to do so. I had my L4/5 DLIF fusion &amp; swayback correction on 10/19/11. He also found the synovial cyst I knew was there. State of the art neurology monitoring was used &amp; I am happy to report at 2 weeks post op that I am pain free for the 1st time in 43 years. My energy level is unbelievable due to the absence of pain. I have to hold myself back so I heal properly. I am walking 2-3 x's/day totalling 2-3 miles. My physical therapy is teaching me the proper mechanics for using my new spine. Alexis &amp; I continue to email with questions &amp; answers. I'm so appreciative of his expertise &amp; great bed side manner. "
1670,38874,1.0," Have mixed feelings about my (new) patient experience with Dr. Falicov. First of all, it took about 6 weeks to get an appointment, no doubt because I was a new patient. That's a bit of a stretch if you are in pain, which I had while walking. Once the appointment arrived, admittance into an exam room was relatively quick. Nice facilities btw. What bothers me is that I NEVER SAW Dr. Falicof! Instead I was consulted by his assistant - who made a determination of hip bursitis and gave me an option of a cortisone injection (which I took). In retrospect, I think it was the proper diagnosis, however after waiting such long time to get an appointment to see &quot;The Doctor&quot;, you would hope to actually see the person you made the appointment for - even if only in passing to confirm the diagnosis.  "
1671,38874,1.0," Worst doctor experience of my life!  Dr. Alexis Falicov, along with his staff, represents all that is wrong with American health care today. Dr. Falicov seemed preoccupied during our visit and even stopped to take two cell phone calls during my initial consultation.  After sending me for an MRI, he and his staff failed to inform me of what the next step was for further treatment.  As a result, I had take it upon myself to start making calls through multiple members of his support staff, none of whom seemed to communicate with each other, and who were snippy and rude, both to myself, and to my wife.  When I finally got someone who seemed to have a partial clue as to what I should do next, I was informed that Dr. Falicov was going on vacation for two weeks, leaving me to essentially have to suffer through the pain that he did not even bother to address on my first visit.  Bottom line: avoid this doctor and his incompetent staff at all costs.   You can find a much better doctor, I did! "
1672,38874,1.0, Dr. Falicov is at the top of his profession.  Great doctor with excellent patient results.  
1673,38874,1.0," I had a knee replacement surgery and was in constant pain for about 8 months, told there was nothing wrong with me. Dr. Falicov diagnosed me immediately, did a surgery, and I have more flexibility 3 weeks after surgery than I did in the last 9 months. The guy is too busy! But he is the greatest. He listens, believes you, he is very scientific  and doesn't jump to surgery as a first option.  I love this guy! "
1674,38874,1.0," I like Dr. Falicov a lot. He takes the time to really explain the situation to you. I really have never encountered a doctor like him that isn't &quot;rush in, rush out and no time for your questions&quot; Dr. Falicov is very patient and kind in answering (maybe that's why he's always running late :) He also uses cortisone and surgery as a last resort. Todd is great too.  "
1675,38874,1.0," Strong expertise but not a know-it-all. Counsels with other doctors to confirm his diagnosis. Good bedside manner, friendly and engaging.  "
1676,38874,1.0," I recently had my second surgery with Dr. Falicov and so far seems to be a success. I do NOT find that he looks to do multiple surgeries for &quot;job security&quot; as he was not jumping into my first surgery with him, he actually ran it by fellow associates for input to confirm if it would do any good. My last surgery was my third in all and compared to my first surgeon, Dr. Falicov and his PA Todd are exceptional. They do well to inform you of pros and cons and what to expect without any candy coating, as it is a serious situation and they should not candy coat it. I have referred a few friends to him and they like him very much as well. "
1677,38916,1.0," My husband saw a Dr. Stafford in this office. He was having such intense pain he could barely stand.  IN HIS CHEST!  I called, was told to come in that he would be &quot;fit it.&quot;  She saw him, evaluated he needed a chest X-ray and a CT scan &quot;stat&quot; but then couldn't read the Xray.  Said, Let me ask Dr. Faiola if he &quot;see's anything,&quot; She sent him home with pain meds, said if it get's worse go to the emergency room.  I called in a favor from a nurse in cardiology at Capital Med. Ctr.  He was seen within the hour.  He took off his shirt for an EKG, the nurse said, &quot;AHA&quot;, you have Shingles. His heart was fine.  The Cardiologist looked over the EKG and confirmed he had Shingle sent him home.  NO Ct scan WAS ever needed. This will pass.  Dr. Stafford meanwhile  was contacted for &quot;Dr.Smith's&quot; findings.  Two weeks latter he needed pain med's, she denied him!  Then left the country to go to Sweden until March. Leaving him with no followup care.  This place is a joke.  See them at your own peril.  "
1678,38916,1.0," presented with an infected finger with severe pain; told to soak it and not to worry. Three hours later the pain was too much and went to ER. ER informed me the infection was so bad I could have lost my finger. Lucky for me I didn't listen to this &quot;doc&quot;. Instead of rushing me along he could drained the finger, prescribed antibiotics, and in conjunction with the soaking and all would have been fine. "
1679,38916,1.0," Dr Faiola and staff run a very efficient organization. Dr Faiola is very thorough, knowledgeable and understanding.  I highly recommend Heritage Family clinic to anyone needing a doctor "
1680,38916,1.0, Physician takes a lot of time with each patient to make sure all concerns are addressed 
1681,38916,1.0," Dr. Faiola is the medical director for a PA-C named David Overton.  Mr. Overton should not be practicing medicine - extremely poor clinical advise, did not meet any of my needs, and ran very expensive, unneccesary tests.  Poor interpersonal skills - talks very soft and very fast so cannot be understood, then will not repeat himself slower.  Avoid this person. "
1682,38916,1.0, Excellent communication from the doctor and his staff.  Very professionally run practice.  One tiny little negative is the company that handles his billing.  They are unreachable and do not return phone calls.  
1683,38916,1.0," I have received some outrageous bills from this guy, but he is about the best GP I have run into. Sometimes he's a little tardy, but I think that is because he cares a little more than your average doctor in private practice.  "
1684,38916,1.0," Their office is very up to date in technology. They have a place for kids to play, and its very relaxing as they play classical music. The nurses were very nice and answered all of my many questions. The doctor came in breifly after I was put into an exam room. He has a great sense of humor and even helped me with problems I didnt come in to see him for. I have had many awful experiences with doctors here in Olympia, and he is the first one out of 7 that I am sticking with.  "
1685,38916,1.0," Interesting comment below about the ice age.  I have know Dr. Faiola for about 25 years now and have to say that, while his humor may be a little off-beat at times, he is a great doctor.  I am probably alive today because of some very subtle physical changes that he caught years ago. Three other doctors thought I was overreacting, but because of Faiola's intense belief that you have to work on the whole package--attitude, exercise, sleep, diet, etc.--and his desire to do more than dose a patient with medicines and tests, I am around today to enjoy my family! I do sometimes have to wait a little to get into my regularly scheduled appointment, but he also manages to fit me and others in for last-minute appointments VERY quickly. Basically an above-average doctor and a good, ethical man.  Have no idea what happened with the unhappy patient who commented below.  I've never heard anything like that from him before (hope I never will, either!).  "
1686,38916,1.0," A good doctor. He is very considerate and polite, although a little patronly sometimes. Very comprehensive with physical exams and labs and has a great whole-body integrative philosophy. "
1687,38916,1.0," The worst experience I ever had! I had to wait an 1 1/2 hours, just to be insulted. Was told that my back pain was the result of me being fat, (actually was told that in an ice age, I would live for awhile just on my own fat!) Take in mind that I am probably 50 lbs. overweight, but the guy had no right to say what he did. I was in tears, and he actually never looked at my back, and going to another doctor after that I had a broken piece of disc, which was causing my pain. Bad doctor.  "
1688,38916,1.0," This guy is wonderful! He practices holistically and has a great awareness of patients' issues in every way. Also completely up on the latest research and does not push for unnecessary or expensive tests/exams unless there is likelihood for improvement of treatment options. Very respectful of patient views/preferences, and has a great attitude. Puts you at ease while you're there. Appointments often run late, but it's well worth the wait. Just a terrific doctor and I wish they could all be like this! "
1689,38917,1.0," I have been seeing Dr. Failor for over 10 years and always find him to be professional, caring, respectful and encouraging.  He answers all my questions and offers wise advice.  I highly recommend him to others needing help with thyroid or other metabolic issues. "
1690,38917,1.0," Worst doctor I have ever been to in my life!  He was late, very unprepared, and lacked any sort of bedside manner.  VERY disappointing.  "
1691,38917,1.0," Dr.Failor is the best. If only I could have him for the normal stuff. He's kind, looks you in the eye, staight forward and talks to you about your issues. He's someone you know you can trust. "
1692,38917,1.0, Dr. Failor is absolutely wonderful. He is extremely patient and does a great job of explaining everything. Very kind and caring man. He has a very common sense approach to handling diabetes and is up on the latest advances. 
1693,38917,1.0," Dr. Failor took care of me for 7 years, pre-op and post-op until I moved out of the State of Washington.  In all the years that I had thyroid disease, no one will ever match the care, kindness and geniune concern given to me by Dr. Failor.  If you are fortunate enough and blessed to be in his care, then you have indeed a &quot;tangible&quot; and &quot;intangible&quot; gift of life!  My thanks for all eternity to Dr. Failor. "
1694,38921,1.0," I had a broken tooth.  The stub of the tooth was not enough to put a crown on, so Dr. Fairbanks used a post.  He shoved the post very deep and unsealed my root canal which was previously sealed by a root canal specialist.  Then he placed the crown on the post, but not very tight.  As a result, food traveled into the root canal and root canal got infected.  The tooth had to be removed completely and I had to get an implant.  Dr.Fairbanks is possibly the worst dentist there is.  He has several actions taken against him by Washington Department of Health:https://fortress.wa.gov/doh/providercredentialsearch...If the link does not work, just look him up under provider credential search on Washington Department of Health website. "
1695,38926,1.0," Rudest and cruelest egotistic man I have ever met.  He wouldn't even listen to what the problem was with the patient he was so busy patting himself on the back for what he did do, which was not what needed to be done.  I will never use HHS hospital again as long as this dr is employed there.  "
1696,38929,0.0, Dr Gala and the staff were very helpful.  She spent enogh time with me to really determine the best treatment for me.  
1697,38929,0.0," Dr. Gala is a caring, wonderful doctor who is extremely knowledgeable, professional and friendly. "
1698,38930,2.0, I enjoyed Dr Ganponia and the staff at Cascade Primary Care @ VMC in Renton(425)656-5400 
1699,38932,0.0," Dr Gallevo talked in circles telling me the same thing over and over again, not answering any of my questions, talking to me in acronyms and basically leaving me clueless as to what was going on with me. She cut me off while I was talking, I didn't feel like she listened AT ALL, she spent about 5-7 minutes with me and walked out of the room without so much as a &quot;bye&quot; when she felt the appointment was over. I was left with numerous unanswered questions and concerns about my health. I would highly recommend choosing a different doctor. "
1700,38932,0.0, I had to explain 3 times that I was not experiencing chest pain. She seemed like she was in a hurry in the office and on the phone. I left wth more questions than answers. 
1701,38934,1.0," Dr. Gambee appears to be a caring doctor.  He called me personally to give me some initial results, and he in my opinion seems to be very competent. I am under treatment with him at this present time.  "
1702,38934,1.0, Very informative about several different situations that maybe the cause of pain. Takes time to explain a variety of conditions.  
1703,38934,1.0, I rate Dr Gambee a 0 if i could he never found the source of my problem and the last time i went to see him he was 50 min behind and made several rude comments about children with special needs. along with the 2 nurses that worked beside him. i changed dr for a second opinion and my first visit with the new doctor he knew right away what was wrong with me and has scheduled my surgery. he said the shot DR Gambee gave me would have never helped. it only made me worse.  
1704,38934,1.0, He was very thorough in locating hard to diagnose source of pain for Surgeon Ashok Modha. Results very very successful.  
1705,38934,1.0," Very professional, competent, willing to answer questions, addressed pain management. Fully explained procedure (epidural steroid injection) including risks and expected results. Good doctor. "
1706,38934,1.0, Caused nerve damage when he performed procedure. 
1707,38938,2.0,.  Wonderful doctor! 
1708,38941,0.0," Very friendly and helpful front desk staff. The assistants work very well with Dr. Galbraith; you get the sense they are very familiar with one another and have lots of experience in everything they do. Dr Galbraith herself is very warm, willing to address all my concerns and answer my questions, and is very easy to talk to. Both my wife and I have had to go several times over the last few years for varying levels of serious dental work, and they have been incredibly helpful in finding a way to help pay for the procedures, since we had no insurance at the time. "
1709,38945,1.0," I was assigned to Dr. Gan for a colonoscopy and endoscopy. After reading the negative review on this site, I was quite worried that I would have a bad experience, but he was actually fine. (I don't doubt that the other person did have a bad experience, but either he has improved, or that was an off day for him). He was friendly, explained things well, and I felt no pain at all during the procedure. His manner was slightly hurried, but less so than many other doctors I've had, and he did take time to answer the questions I had. "
1710,38945,1.0, My husband just had the most horrible experience with this doctor.  Absolutely horrible.  He performed an endoscopic procedure on my husband and did not use enough sedative.  My husband was totally away during the whole painful uncomfortable process and had to be restrained.  He was incredibly rude to my husband and acted like this procedure was a complete inconvenience to him. I am going to be writing a letter to the hospital where this procedure was performed and perhaps to the American Medical Association.  I am just disgusted.  
1711,38962,1.0, HE REFUSED ME WHEN I NEEDED HIM THE MOST ! and did not listen to me when I came to him with my consers and  HE flat out did'nt help me at the END of my procedure. I ened up having to wait and I found out that I was wright all along. but not his problem. now one side of my belly is lop sided.  
1712,38962,1.0, His staff is excellent.  I never felt alone through the recovery period. Thank you. Paid/Co-pay:$8200
1713,38962,1.0, Great job . I new I could trust dr gabreil I new I was in good hands very satisfied with my surgery. He is a five star doctor. Paid/Co-pay:$6400
1714,38962,1.0, made me feel very comfortable and highly recommend him 
1715,38962,1.0," i felt such compasssion from his whole staff, and they took the time to know me personally. will never go anywhere else "
1716,38965,1.0," First of all, this listing is inaccurate; he currently practices in Kirkland.  I put &quot;4&quot; for punctuality.  I honestly don't pay much attention to whether he's on time or not, but I've never had to wait more than 5 min to see him.  He's a nice guy and you can feel comfortable talking to him about anything.  I see him for depression and my mood has gone up and down over time, but is a ton better than before I started taking meds.  You can tell he reads medical journals, which is a good sign.  He's not afraid to adjust/change meds and use multiple meds at a time, if that's what you need.  I do get a bit frustrated that my mood goes down sometimes and wonder if he is really doing all he can, but at the same time you can't rely on just meds to get better.  Overall he's a good doc. "
1717,38968,1.0, Specializes in sports medicine and allergies. He is always willing to sit down and discuss with the patient. Have used him since 1994.  
1718,38968,1.0, He is very good at what he does. Back pain went away very quickly. 
1719,38969,0.0," Rebecca Gallaway the nurse-practitonerone did not take a single note, while talking to me looking at the wall, then she ran out of the room 3 times while she had a computer - that is usually used - right in front of her. 5 hours later I went to my farmacy and my prescription was not even there. VERY DISSAPOINTED! "
1720,38975,0.0," Gage treated me for heavy periods and fibroids. A very painful in-office biopsy was performed with inadequate pain medication. When I told her pain meds don't usually work on me, she alluded that I was a drug addict. After an ablation, she prescribed me a hormone pill over the phone with no exam and I had an adverse reaction. She never returned my pages.  At the next office visit, she said &quot;well...you wouldn't call your lawyer on the weekend and expect him to call you back without getting paid, would you&#63;&#63;&#63;&quot;  Another doc was retained, but she couldn't save my uterus or left ovary due to severe endo. She said it had been in there while, probably prior to my procedure with Gage 6 months earlier,because I was covered in it. Gage likes to paint her patients as having anxiety/depression/some other mental disorder she is not qualified to diagnose etc...but I think the lesson she should take away from this is 'physician heal thyself.' Avoid at all costs.  "
1721,38975,0.0," I have been a patient of Dr. Gage's for 17 years and am beyond sad that she has had to close her practice due to financial issues with her new business venture.  I agree with many that have posted here that I think she got herself in over her head when she opened her new women's wellness center with spa, restaurant, etc.  In her defense, she opened it with 2 other doctors who, when finances became a little tight, bailed on her.  Due to her great amount of stress, I think that the quality of care did go down in the last couple of years, which is unfortunate.  Hopefully people won't judge her simply on those couple of years.  She had provided me with excellent car for the previous 15 years, delivering all 3 of my babies to me safely and with great care and skill.  My last baby ended up going into distress and Dr. Gage acted quickly and competently, getting her to me safely.  I wish Dr. Gage only the best in her new ventures.  I will always be grateful to her for being a great doctor.  "
1722,38975,0.0," I had been a patient of Dr. Gage since my first gyn appt when I was 18. Over the past 14 years, she delivered all 4 of my babies. My first baby was a difficult delivery as he weighed close to 10lbs and was almost 22in long. She also gave me great care during my stay in the hospital while I was in pre term labor. Although she could have brushed up on her bedside manners a bit, she was a wonderful Dr. and became a good friend over the years. She gave careful attention to high risk pregnancies, my last baby was not head down and she managed to turn him so that I did not have to goo for a c section. I am truly blessed to have met her, my babies are blessed to have been delivered by her, and aside from my deliveries, she helped me through other female health issues. I never had a problem with her staff, and I give her complete credit for pulling me and my baby through my first delivery. If it were not for her, one of us may not be here right now. All I have to say is Thank You to her! "
1723,38975,0.0," If you are pregnant Dr. Gage might be great because that seems to be her specialty, but otherwise she's horrible. I got into my appointment 45 minutes late only to be rushed through it because Dr. Gage was on call for the hospital. She was very snappy and inconsiderate. I understand that she was on call, but no one informed me of this and I would have been more accepting if she had approached me with it in a more courteous manner. My appointment was cut short and others were canceled because Dr. Gage had to go deliver a baby. The patients should be informed of this, because if I have to wait a month for an appointment, I don't want it to be cut short. And thank god I'm not allergic to dogs, because there were two huge ones running around the halls and barking. Very unprofessional, not to mention probably illegal due to health concerns. Overall, this was the worst experience I've ever had at a doctor. I will never go back and I will recommend that others stay away. "
1724,38975,0.0," Dr. Gage has been my doctor for well over 12 years.  Up to last week, I felt the care I got was both caring and competent.  Last week I was seen for pelvic pain.  Dr. Gage gave me a quick read on what was probably going on which included the word &quot;cancer&quot; and lots of procedures that might follow.  Then, she did an in-office biopsy which I agreed to.  During the entire office visit when I tried to ask questions and come to terms with this quick diagnosis, she acted as though all of this was something I had intentionally caused. She was rude beyond belief.  At the end of the biopsy, she started changing her diagnosis and said, oh you are probably allright.  Jeez!  I held the tears back until I got to the car.  Dr. Gage, I hope you read the entries here, because many of us are receiving the same rude, demeaning treatment from you  and you need to take it to heart.  I also agree, as others have said that you may be stretched thin with business ventures.  Anyway, I won't ever return.  "
1725,38975,0.0," I WOULD USE ANOTHER DOCTOR.  I FOUND DR.GAGE TO HAVE A POOR BEDSIDE MANNER.  SHE TALKS DOWN TO HER PATIENTS, AND, SEEMS TO BE BOTHERED BY BEING ASKED QUESTIONS, AND SHOWS LITTLE TO NO CONCERN. HER STAFF DID NOT RETURN REPEATED PHONE CALLS, REGUARDING A POST DELIVERY PROBLEM. WHEN I WENT IN FOR A APPT. ABOUT THE PROBLEM, I WAS TOLD THAT, I DON'T HANDLE PAIN WELL.  I THEN WENT FOR A SECOND OPPINION, AND FOUND THERE WAS A PROBLEM, AND WAS CORRECTLY TREATED.  I WAS NOT IMPRESSED AT ALL WITH DR. GAGE. "
1726,38975,0.0, I am so grateful for Dr. Gage! She is insightful and thorough. She delivered my twins in 2002. My quality of care was first class. She is direct and confident in her medical expertise. Too many physicians are passive patient order takers. I am thankful Dr. Gage is far wiser than to take on the role of a coddling mother. Thanks Dr.  Gage for your professional excellence! TL 
1727,38975,0.0," I am so pleased to have found Dr. Gage, she has been my Dr. for 4 years.  She has been extremely helpful in diagnosing and treating me with a functional medicine approach - treating the whole person not only reproductive health.  I would highly recommend her and do often.  Her staff Nutritionist, Nurse Practioner and Nurse have all been pleasant, timely and attentive.  Dr. Gage is very intellegent and is up on the cutting edge of medicine and patient diagnosis.   I would HIGHLY recommend her!!!! "
1728,38975,0.0," Dr Gage was the worst doctor experience.She didn't knock before entering the room,and she gave me the gruffest pap. She was curt,condescending and told me that I had a potentially deadly infection without any further discussion besides a rudely stated&quot;you'll have to wait until the end of the week to get the results.&quot;When I told her what I thought it might be,based on a previous condition that I'd been diagnosed with,she insisted I was wrong.Not only was she wrong about the results,her ego refused to let her consider that she was wrong.She wanted to run expensive biopsies at which point I decided I would no longer be a client.A different gyno quickly and correctly diagnosed my symptoms and prescribed a treatment that remedied the situation.I don't recommend Gage,no matter how smart she may be.I don't need to be mollycoddled. I do demand common courtesy.After this traumatic event,I got a bill! I wasn't informed by her staff that since my last visit, my insurance stopped coverage of her! "
1729,38975,0.0," I have never been treated as poorly by a provider as I did on a follow-up visit with Dr. Gage.  Rather than discussing dosing adjustments related to new hormone replacement therapy she started me on, she asked whether I had taken antidepressants before.  I indicated I was uncomfortable in taking antidepressants if dosing changes would help.  Dr. Gage's reponse was, &quot;there's no free lunch in life&quot;.  She went on to deny a conversation she had with me on my first visit re: my cholesterol level and become further irritated when I shared a conversation I had with her office nurse about not re-filling my hormone prescription until after I saw Dr. Gage at my follow-up visit.  After continual rudeness, I excused myself from her office and indicated that obviously we would not be a good fit. "
1730,38975,0.0, I had my first and last visit today with Dr. Gage. She was so unfriendly and unconcerned with the issues I was trying to discuss. I left without having had anything done or aswered. I was also not even seen until an hour after my apt. time and she left me waiting 10 minutes on the exam table!   I recommend you do not make her you gynocologist. 
1731,38975,0.0," Staff is catty, on hold for a long time each time you call. My first visit was an annual visit - she was very rough and had me squirming off the table in pain during the manual part of the exam. She appeared irritated as I was describing symptoms and asked questions. She also stayed in the room after the exam and told me to get dressed, I felt very uncomfortable trying to &quot;clean up&quot; and get dressed with her in the room. She did refer me for an ultrasound for pelvic pain where the technician mentioned that I had a fibroid. When I saw Dr. Gage for the follow up, she told me there was no findings and I was fine. When I asked about the fibroid, she kind of smiled and admitted there was one...she wasn't even going to tell me about it! Of course I didn't trust her after that. Referred me to the nutritionist, who was just wonderful by the way. Her nurse is very nice too. But I am not going back to her this year. I can't imagine going through a pregnancy with her! Do not recommend her.  "
1732,38975,0.0," Dr. Gage was my gynecologist for about 7 years.  In general, I was happy with her care (although her nursing staff was erratic about returning phone calls promptly).  In the past couple of years, I developed a gynecological problem, which Dr. Gage minimized.  She proposed that she work on the problem in an in-office procedure that she has never done before(!!)  I saw another gynecologist, and this gyno confirmed my suspicions regarding my condition (it was serious: I had a severely prolapsed uterus and a polyp in my uterus).  I have now had my uterus removed, and I won't be going to Dr. Gage anymore.  I believe that Dr. Gage's focus has been shifted since she opened her spa/cafe right next door to her offices.  Being a gynecologist, an obstretrician, and an owner of a spa and cafe is stretching oneself a little too thin.  I'd recommend that women patients seek other care for their gynecological needs.  "
1733,38975,0.0, I'm so glad I found Dr. Gage. She is the first doctor I've ever been to who has really listened to my concerns and what I had to say. She is innovative and caring and I will go to her as long as she is in practice. 
1734,38975,0.0," Dr. Gage is a wonderful doctor. She listens well and takes chronic symptoms seriously. I appreciate her knowledge of nutrition, etc. The only critique I have is that her office staff can be a little catty and rude, especially on the phone. "
1735,38988,1.0, Spent less than 5 minutes with me after I waited over 30 minutes in the office for him.  
1736,39004,2.0," Unresponsive to requests for appointments, ignores phone messages and not interested in patients overall care. "
1737,39009,2.0,  
1738,39011,1.0," Dr. Ryan Gaalswyk is simply the best, he cares and work hard to help and cure his patient.  "
1739,39018,0.0," A totally unhelpful dr. Told me I couldn't be in as much pain as I said I was. Turns out I could, having 3 tumors on my uterus!  Maybe if she had taken the time to do a proper exam instead of dismissing me because of what she &quot; thought&quot; was the problem, she would have the proper tests. She takes one problem and ignores any other symptoms to make a snap judgement.  Beware of her!!! "
1740,39018,0.0," Bad bedside manner, she comes across as non sympathetic, judgmental and reproachful. She's quick to attribute various health problems to lifestyle choices without further explanation, answers like &quot;you are getting older&quot;. Does not explain anything thoroughly unless I ask many questions. The pills she prescribed created a long-term health problem for me but not once did she accept responsibility. Her assistant is ok. "
1741,39018,0.0, Dr. Ilika was very good and made me very comfortable and was able to answer my questions very well. Overall had a very good experience and would recommend to anyone.  
1742,39018,0.0," Dr. Ilika has helped me with a variety of problems over the last 14 years.  She has excellent bedside manner, she is good at explaining things so I can understand them, and she is very gentle. I love her nurse, Andrea!  She gave me my guardasil shots, and I hardly felt a thing.  I have recommended Dr. Ilika to several of my friends, and they all love her too.   She's a real gem! "
1743,39018,0.0," Dr. Ilika is a dream!  She is so smart and patient- she has helped me with a lot of issues over the years.  Several of my friends go to her too, and they all love her!  Her nurse, Andrea is lovely, and the front office staff is very considerate and helpful too.  "
1744,39018,0.0," Dr. Ilika is an excellent doctor and great gynecologist.  She is caring, but direct and provides excellent diagnostic and high quality gynecological care.  She saw me through several major gynecological issues including fibroid tumors growing throught the uterine wall and endrometrial pre-cancer.  You can trust Dr. Ilika to give you a thorough exam, bring important health concerns to your attention, and identify options for treatment.  She may not tell you what you want to hear but she will tell you what you need to hear, and in a caring and professional manner.   I would not hesitate to recommend her! "
1745,39018,0.0," I have seen Dr. Ilika for 5 years.  Always on time, always accessible for urgent matters, always get my test results promptly from her wonderful MA Andrea (she has been there all but the first year since I started going there).  A small point, but always CLOTH gowns (so not sure about the previous poster and her paper gown) and warm speculums.  She is very thorough and ends my visit by telling me what my most urgent health issue is...  and sometimes it's not what I think it is!  One year it was stress (and it's effect on my sleep and blood pressure) and she pursued a problem that I was not worried about with slightly odd spotting when it was still benign (a precancerous polyp inside uterus was discovered to be the cause).  I love the happy office and that she does NOT do Obstetrics, so I'm not competing with pregnant patients for her time.  Visits really are the full 30 minutes. And she has secure online email through her website.   I used it when I was in Japan on vacation! "
1746,39018,0.0," She told me while in a paper gown that all fat people die young, you see no old fat people at a local mall, and humiliated me in her office.  She could have waited to talk to me until I got dressed.  She could have phrased things a little nicer.  She could have done ANYTHING different and I wouldn't give her a negative review.   But if you are overweight and looking for a gyno, do NOT go to this woman!!!! "
1747,39018,0.0, She is amazingly punctual.  The best I have had in this area.  Bedside manner and knowledge is also solid.  She genuinely shows care for her patients and asks questions to really assess the issue.  
1748,39018,0.0, I have been a patient since 2004 and have always recieved great care. 
1749,39018,0.0, Dr. Ilika is quite likely the best physician I have ever been to. She is thoroughly attentive and patient.  
1750,39018,0.0," Very non sympathetic, very bad and irresponsible nurse called sally.overall totally upset over doctors experince "
1751,39019,0.0," It is true, you get what you pay for.  For years I was happy giving a $20 co-pay and my health only got worse.   Now I am truly inventing in my health and thanks to Dr. Kim's Incredible knowledge base I keep moving forward- She is solid with pharmaceuticals, herbals, some physical medicine.  She even studies acupuncture in China!  The office staff are a great group of ladies who are always warm and helpful.  I don't think I even waited longer than 10 minutes for my appointment.  I just can't thank you enough. Paid/Co-pay:$150"
1752,39024,0.0, My kids love her. She talks to them in language they understand and always make them comfortable. 
1753,39026,2.0, I was extremely impressed with the Sunrise Dental facility and all of their staff. They were extremely polite and hospitable. I was even offered a parafin wax treatment for my hands while i waited! Sunrise Dental will take away all the fears you ever had of going to the dentist! 
1754,39027,1.0, Was the worst apt I have ever been to in my life.He was very rude. Did not know what was wrong with me and did not refer me to another dr to diagnose me. I was crying after the exam from being in more pain.Also imededitely after appointment I had to go to the emergency room b/c exam caused me more pain. Then I called to complain about this later and seceretary was also rude and said that I misconsucred what was said but thats why my boyfriend said to never go back there and he never thought a dr could be that rude and not get in trouble for it.  
1755,39031,1.0, Dr. Xavier is the best chiropractor I have ever had. He is excellent and is really great and has helped me out a lot. I had terrible feet problems and he really made most of it go away I have been going here for about 6-7 months. The staff here and the front desk staff is also awesome.  I am very pleased   kimberley wright 
1756,39031,1.0," I have recently been to Dr. Xavier, he is wonderful in his treatment plan. I feel in my home hanging lights &amp; other decorations in the evening, the following day we called and was able to get in to see Dr. X. He has been working with the rotator cuff and helping in releasing the muscles that are protecting it. I would not hesitate to refer others to him or anyone in their office. "
1757,39031,1.0," Midway Chiropractic basically allowed me to play high school football this year.  I strained my rotator cuff during baseball and i could barely lift my arm.  After going to Midway for a month and working with Dr. Xavier, my arm was as good as its ever been and i think maybe even a bit better. -Tony "
1758,39045,1.0," I have been seeing Dr ilk for at least 5 years. He is the most attentive, knowledgeable and compassionate chiro I have been to.  He really cares about his patients.  He is also very professionals and keeps up with new information.  "
1759,39045,1.0," Goes out of his way to help with swift appointments and continued support and interest in your problems, both back related and otherwise. A fabulous Chiro. "
1760,39061,1.0, This has got to be the friendliest office. Doc Ingle and Dr Lockett both make you feel at ease and you left meeting a friend. You will love going to this office.  
1761,39061,1.0, WONDERFUL DENTIST! Awesome STAFF! Dr Ingle treats his staff & Patients great you can tell. Also he did my crown 30 years ago & it's still perfect!! He takes pride in being a perfectionist! He's a Wyoming boy so prepare to get a few Hunting stories from him.  Voted Best dentist in the Seattle Magazine too 
1762,39063,1.0," Bedside manner may be a bit lacking in the day-to-day things, but he is an amazing physician. Very smart and I trusted him completely with myself and my baby.  "
1763,39071,0.0," My daughter presented with lateral foot pain. She's 11 years old and is perfectly capable of pin-pointing the exact location of her pain; which she did.  The doctor keep making references to the facial expressions on my daughter's face as a method of identify the location of her pain.    The doctor ordered x-ray's of her ankle, missing all the bones of her foot.   A really bad experience; a waste of time, and money. "
1764,39072,1.0," Dr. Innes was very easy to see and sounded nice on the phone.  I soon came to realize after our first meeting, however that he is awkward and more of a medical doctor who is quick to prescribe medication rather than someone who is interested in finding what is really going on.  If you want someone to give you medication without bothering to dig into what's really going on, he's you're man.  I had a very odd experience with him too where I asked him about a discrepancy with a bill.  My insurance gave me one amount and he sent another so I asked him about it.  He became frantic, even shaking, as he insisted that I owed him the amount he sent.  At no time did I ever say I wouldn't pay, but was simply curious about the discrepancy.  He may work for some people, but it was the worst psychologist/psychiatrist experience I've ever had by far.  "
1765,39073,1.0," I had to have another doctor tell him he had to perform my surgery, when my post surgery labs showed inflammation and need of my surgery, the doctor lied to my face and told be there was nothing wrong, and I didn't need the surgery like he said. He was rude and could use a refresher course in etiquette. He would never address me in the office, only talk to my husband, and had very cold bedside manners.  "
1766,39078,0.0," I have met many different drs but she is one of my favorites. She believes in preventative medicine, kind, and takes time to care for patients.  Highly recommend her! "
1767,39078,0.0," The previous rating is so unfair and unkind that I cannot believe it is about the same Doctor. Dr. Ionescu is the kindest, sweetest woman in the world. She is caring and thorough, and in all the years I have known her, I have never seen her 'roll her eyes'. She is wonderful with children, and she is a wonderful doctor.  "
1768,39078,0.0," I went to this person because I was looking for a new Internist to add to my Medical Team. Dr Raluca Ionescu was very aggressive, rude, interrupts, does not listen, and more.  When I explain my health to a doctor, I don't expect them to roll their eyes when I'm telling them about the very rare untreatable surgical Cancer I've survived so far, of which she knew NOTHING....But I do, because I've researched every corner of it for the last 5 1/2 yrs.  Honestly, this woman's ego is so beyond the pale, that she's a danger rather than a help to her patients.  And this, is just from a 1st visit.   With my health, multiple issues, a rare NeuroEndrocine Cancer, Rheumatiod Arthritis, Cardiology issues, and now a Brain Tumor that she says is no big deal&#63;  Without looking at my 3 MRI's that I've had in the last 10 months&#63; It's pretty sad, when one can't take the stress that this woman puts on the plate of her patients. I told her that she wasn't going to work out, so I got up left.  "
1769,39086,1.0, Dr. Icenogle is outstanding. Skilled and worthy of all praise as a physician. No other like him. 
1770,39096,0.0," Very friendly, helpful, and hard-working. If you feel you are not getting to the bottom of your issues, ask to get a referral. She is a General Practitioner, so is not an expert in all areas.  "
1771,39096,0.0," I have been seeing Wendy for several years and I absolutely LOVE her.  She has taken the time to get to know me and my issues very well.  Although she may be running behind from time to time, I find her to be very attentive and thorough.  I have had two heart attacks and both times - she called me when she heard about it to make sure that I was okay and just to see how I was doing.  She really cares about her patients and it shows and I am very happy I found her. "
1772,39096,0.0, Wendy is a friendly doctor but lacking terribly in being prompt to attend to her patients. I waited one hour for a physical and was never checked on or told that Wendy was running late with her patients by either her medical assistant or Wendy herself. It was awful and cold to wait one hour unclothed and wondering if you've been forgotten. I quickly got dressed and excused myself as I left. Wendy was quick to say I was next in line but it was unacceptable to me to be kept waiting an hour. I would rather find someone who is prompt in taking care of their patients needs. I didn't feel Wendy gave much attention to my health complaints or concerns. But I can thank her for the quality of care that I am now receiving thanks to that fateful day. Sometimes bad things happen for a good reason.  
1773,39096,0.0," Wendy is an incredible, accessible physician who pours a lot of herself into the patients she sees. Warning: your appointment WILL begin at a later time than scheduled! Wendy is notorious for refusing to allow the 10 minute scheduling block to interfere with the care she gives her patients! This will translate into you being in the waiting room more, but rest assured, when you need to be the person with the extra-long appointment, you will get it! ;-) Wendy is approachable (even with young kids) and gets to know the individuals and families that she sees. She asks great questions and looks at the patient as a whole--not as a body to be &quot;fixed,&quot; but as an overall person with feelings and needs. She does not walk lock-step with the medical establishment (although she is bound by her affiliations to provide the party line on issues such as vaccination, etc.) but obviously sees herself as a partner in treatment.  Quite a find! "
1774,39098,1.0, I have never met a more nicer caring person than Dr Ionescu!!  He really takes the time to listen. He is the best Dr I've ever seen!!!! 
1775,39098,1.0," He is one of the most compassionate, caring dr's. I have had the privilege  to know.  He is a keeper for our community.  "
1776,39099,0.0," I visited Dr. Iovino several years ago when I lived in Washington. She treated me for endometriosis for about a year before I moved out of state. I found that she was very kind and compassionate, as well as knowledgable and friendly. I highly recommend this doctor if you're looking for an OB/GYN in central Washington state. She works at the Yakima Valley Farm Workers Clinic in Top****h, which provides a sliding scale for low income patients. But even if you're not low income, this physician is EXCELLENT and comes highly recommended. "
1777,39111,1.0," Dr. Ibrahim has seen all of my kids for about 16 years.  I actually changed over to him after my middle child was born.  He just happened to be the on call pediatrician the day my son was born.  He was so much more friendly and hands on with my new born and very pleasant.  I am so happy I made the change I did back then.  My children are now 18, 16 and 3.  They all think he is wonderful and never once made any of them feel uncomfortable.  I feel safe to say that he is the best pediatrician out there.  Not only is he available for emergencies, but he very accomodating.  We love you, Dr.  Ibrahim!  The Pattillo's &amp; Brown's "
1778,39111,1.0, I absolutely adore Dr Ibrahim.  He has been my daughters Ped for almost 6 years. He is very good with her and very patient with me.  I really feel that he is intirely vested in my child's health.   Side note- his office manager is not the easiest person to work with but the nursing staff is great.  
1779,39111,1.0," Very good bedside manners, very knowledgeable, available after office hours. Office staff very helpful and pleasant.  "
1780,39120,0.0, Dr. Jacobson was wonderful.  I was diagnosed with Skin Cancer and she did a mohs surgery.  She and her   staff were kind and kept me informed about each thing   they were doing.  I will continue to see Dr. Jacobson   on a regular basis for skin checkups.. 
1781,39123,1.0," I have been a patient of Dr. Jacobson since 1998. While he is overworked like most doctors these days due to overall patient volume, I have found him to be knowledgable, approchable and he has worked collaboratively with me in determining the most appropriate and effective treatment for my MS.  "
1782,39123,1.0, This was one of the worst doctors I have ever seen in my entire life. I just had to share this with others in hopes that they wont choose this doctor. He was over an hour late and only spent 10 minutes with me. He didn't answer any of my questions and made me feel like i was stupid. His staff was great and had great bedside manner which he did not. 
1783,39128,1.0, I have been going to him for about 6 years. Takes the time to listen to problems &amp; concerns. Very through &amp; conservate w/treatment.  
1784,39128,1.0, Good outcome oriented Doc.  Takes time to talk about things and listens well.  
1785,39128,1.0, I think he is one of the most caring doctors I have ever been to. He listens to you and is very helpful with information if you don't understand. If he does not know something he is willing to look for information on what ever subject you are asking about. He is my regular doctor and he treats my crps or rsd I have this in both of my legs.I also have fibromyalisa.He is also taking new patients and he accepts the state medical. 
1786,39131,0.0," Shari Jackson is wonderful.  I had a EVLT and scherotherapy done by her and was very happy with both her treatment of me, and the results.  I no longer have leg pain standing for long periods of time.   The cosmetic effects were also good, but not as dramatic. I originally saw another doc at Via Vascular and wasn't impressed.  Shari was excellent at communicating to me about the procedures, and had excellent bedside manner. "
1787,39133,1.0," dr jackson, saved my life.  He might of been airegont, but he knew what he was doing.   it's been almost two yrs since i had surgery  i just wish i could lose the weight to have my ostomy reversed "
1788,39133,1.0,.  Very rude and did a poor surgery job! Told mom that she didn't need surgery and told dad that she needed surgery&#63;&#63; 
1789,39137,2.0, Very kind and understanding. 
1790,39164,1.0, Dr. Jacobson has poor bedside manner and he does not listen to his patients. He always wants to refer you to see a different doctor rather than taking the responsibility. I am surprised he even has a medical license. 
1791,39168,1.0," Dr. Jackson has been my primary health care physician for almost 20 years.  He is thorough, thoughtful and very knowledgeable.  He prescribed physical therapy where other doctors, i.e. at the Sports Medicine Clinic in Ballard, recommended knee and neck surgery.  He's one of the best. "
1792,39168,1.0, Dr. Jackson is always helpful and concerned about my care. When he feels he can't give me the best care he will referr me to a doctor that can. I appreciated the time he takes to listen to me as well. 
1793,39177,1.0," Dr. Jackman was one of the rudest people I have ever met.  He was about 45 minutes late to our appointment, didn't make eye contact once, and only spoke with rude remarks as I relayed the torture I have been going through.  In the end, he said I needed surgery without discussing with me why I needed it or explaining the operation.  I ended up having surgery with another doctor because of the rudeness and lack of communication skills displayed by Dr. Jackman.  "
1794,39177,1.0," I am very happy with Dr. Jackman's help ith my back problem.  I had many doctor's try to assist me and find out what was causing me constant pain with no sucess.  After an MRI and xray's Dr Jackman made a recomendation for me to have surgery.  I followed his advice and had surgery 04/12/2012.  I am now able to walk 18 holes of golf which was impossible before the operation.  I am now pain free and have not taken any pain medication since the operation.  I highly recommend Dr. Jackman and his loyal staff.   Jim Platt Clyde Hill, WA "
1795,39177,1.0," Stay away! He is arrogant, condescending and makes mistakes. Very quick to pull the scalpel instead of looking for ways around it. In his world only he knows best. The problem is he is not that good.  "
1796,39177,1.0," Very unprofessional.  I had a horrible experience.  He accused me of &quot;throwing a fit to get into him&quot; which did not happen at all.  Said, &quot;good thing you don't live in Canada.&quot;  I am not sure if he is to blame or his administration for causing the drama.  I could not take the next available appointment and asked if I could see the PA instead.  I was told no. Then I asked for next appointment (9 days out) and simply asked if he would call sooner if there were significant findings on the MRI.  By no means a &quot;fit&quot;.  I felt abused and mistreated - extremely unprofessional.  His nurse was great though.  I will NEVER go back there and would not recommend him to anyone.  His rude, egotistical behavior made a stressful day, even more horrible.  He appeared cocky and full of himself.     When I went for my MRI the paper work said &quot;right knee pain&quot;  my MRI was for my back!! I never said anything about my knee!  I learned my lesson - should have researched my doctor more...  "
1797,39177,1.0," I went there w/ multiple issues.  Back pain, waking up in the night screaming, knee pain that has been going on for YEARS, sometimes I can't walk and a hip issue.  For back pain he told me he &quot;Could&quot; get an MRI, but he thought it was nothing (Nothing&#63;!&#63;!  Waking up screaming in the middle of the night is nothing&#63;) After the MRI he told me, basically, sorry nothing I can do for u, keep losing weight (I am 40lbs overweight - not a high amnt for someone my hgt(how does that help me right now w/ the pain&#63;) For the knees, well, you'll have to do PT. (I've done PT MULTIPLE TIMES over the past 20 years) and the hip - go see this other doc in my practice.  Every referral seemed 2 be 2 someone else in HIS office.  Seems odd to me.  First appt  I waited 1 hour and 15 minutes to see him and he tapped his pen like he had somewhere else to be.  Second appt I waited 1 hour 10 minutes to see him.  He picked at his fingers the whole time we were in the room.  I will never go back to him again.  "
1798,39177,1.0, Dr. Jackman saved me after several years of trying to find someone to fix the pain and numb legs and feet that I had been experiencing. All other doctors wanted to feed me pills and do PT to fix an issue that was well beyond both. Jackman listens! and prescribes treatment accordingly. I am scheduled for surgery tomorrow and am looking forward to relief.  
1799,39177,1.0, Very caring and knowledgeable. Also very personable. Paid/Co-pay:$15
1800,39177,1.0," I had my surgery 11/4/08! My back is 100% better.The only pain I have is the healing pain from the fusion and nerve decompression. When I was in the hospital, he visited me all the time. He would make sure to stop in before he went home for the night also. He cares like a real doctor should do. That is hard to find now days! Dr. Todd Jackman is very professional, caring, smart, real, loyal, and a great doctor all the way around. You will not go wrong if you decide to go to him.  "
1801,39177,1.0," I had back surgery last Dec.07. I been having a lot of problems with a numb leg, pain,and I can't sleep at night without waking up crying. My old doctor said I would be stuck like this forever and I need a new job. I love my job! A week ago I went to Jackman to get another opinion and he told me right away, your L5 vertebrae slipped. I tell you, it was like he was giving back my life because the last year I had no life! I am 34 years old now! I am too young to be laying on my back plus I can't even go to the store to shop for food or anything. I can only get a few items or ride the scooter. It was killing my pride and me! I can honestly tell you he is the best. Oh, He also explained why my right leg and foot is numb and that the L5 and S1 control what area.  He anwsered all my questions that I have been asking my old doc for the last year! "
1802,39184,1.0, Rude &amp; seemed like he could care less if I lived or died. More concerned about his motorcycle trip.  
1803,39185,2.0, Embodies the best practices and philosophy of family medicine. 
1804,39188,1.0," Dr. Jackson has been our physician since moving to Vancouver five years ago.  Not only is he a wonderful diagnostician, he also is proactive in sending his patients to specialists when he doesn't have the answers. He is always thorough, listens to his patients, and is an excellent doctor.   I would highly recommend him! "
1805,39192,0.0," Dr. Jacobs is very compassionate.  Her knowledge of 'what ails you' is expansive.  If she doesn't know, she isn't afraid to refer you to a specialist. "
1806,39192,0.0," Very caring and polite, takes time to discuss problems or concerns. Asks questions and answers mine. Not only treats you as a patient, but is concerned how treatment will effect family. Is always available if needed. Paid/Co-pay:$6"
1807,39203,1.0, DR JACKSON IS THE WORST PSYCHIATRIST EVER!!!!  I saw him four time and every appointment was worst then before.  I am Bipolar and General anxiety disorder.  He told me I am not Bipolar.  He change one of my meds to Celexa 40 mg to help with my anxiety.  Ever since I reach max dosage I have been manic.  He told me today and my last appointment I am not manic that I have borderline personality disorder.  He would not look at my past records for my previous psychiatrist.  He made me feel bad and said all my problems was situation and all I need is counseling.  He is rude does not listen and you walk out of his office feeling worst then when you got in the office.  If you have an appointment with him cancel it and get another doctor ASAP.  
1808,39203,1.0, I have a depression and anxiety issue and with Dr. Jackson it made it worse. He shamed me into thinking that my depression and anxiety was my fault. He disrespected me. I told him that I wanted to go to online school and he said no that that would be the worst thing to do. He also critisized me for the choices that I have made. Yes I just started learning to drive and I am 20 and yeah I was having issues with school I know that but it was my depression that was beating me up and Dr. Jackson said that it was all of my fault. I honestly wanted to die after this because I know that I have made bad choices but I was trying to work on them. Also he was upset when I went to my primary care physician for meds. I was having issues with my sleep aid and she gave me something else and Dr. Jackson actually scolded me for going to my regular Dr for that when in the first place she had prescribed me the sleep aid. 
1809,39203,1.0," George F. Jackson was extremely rude to me. I have had two appointments with him. He did not care how I felt he just boomed out questions at me. He was intimidating and I have anxiety. He should not be in this line of work if he does not care about people, period. I have to say he is the worst person I have personally encountered in a medical profession. On top of all this, he scheduled both my appointments during school days and he was very late to both of them. He is not nice, he is not helpful, and he does not care about his patients.  "
1810,39203,1.0, Dr Jackson was caustic and rude.  He was not helpful.  He didn't listen and missed the diagnosis resulting in an additional hospitalization. 
1811,39203,1.0,.   
1812,39203,1.0," I know several people who have been patients of Dr. Jackson and everyone had positive comments. He is knowledgeable and willing to start with a fresh perspective and offer new ideas. He is personable, talks with and spends time with his patients. I read the negative reviews and I have a difficult time believing this represents the Same George Jackson. Highly recommended. "
1813,39203,1.0, My wife just saw this &quot;Dr.&quot; and I'm glad for his sake I was at work and wasn't able to come with her. My wife has been struggling with really bad anxiety and panic atacks for the past two years. We wanted to go to a psychiatrist for some coping exercises. Instead my wife got grilled on why she home-schooled and didn't go to college. Really&#63; Some quotes from the visit were: My wife-&quot;I struggle with low self esteem&quot; Dr. Jackson-&quot;But you're beautiful. Why&#63;&#63;&quot; Amazing. my wife is attractive so she shouldn't have any self esteem problems. This one is my favorite: &quot;I really think you're doing yourself a disservice by letting your anxiety run your life instead of you&quot; This man is a waste of time. Wow! My wife can choose not to have her unstoppable panic attacks&#63;!&#63; If only we had known!! This man is an idiot. 
1814,39203,1.0," WARNING:  STAY AWAY FROM THIS DOCTOR and pray you are never hospitalized where he is on staff (St. Joseph).  I saw this doctor at his office at Rainier Associates because my previous doc moved out of the area and he was on my health plan.  BIG MISTAKE.  He is the most disrespectful, un-knowledgeable psychiatrist I have seen in 15 years (and I've seen a few both good and bad).      Like another reviewer said, he refuses to look at other records and even greet you cordially.  During my visit with him, he wouldn't look me in the face.  Despite the fact I was struggling, crying, in near-crisis and facing hospitalization, he was more intent on looking at was happening in the parking lot outside his window than speaking or listening to me.  He also didn't even care to address future care with me nor a prospective treatment plan.  I never returned after the first visit and immediately pursued care elsewhere.  "
1815,39203,1.0," Worst Doctor(and staff) I have ever seen.  Waited over 30 minutes past my scheduled time.  Did not shake my hand or introduce himself upon initial meeting.  During the initial visit I had all my existing records (which he did not want to examine)and proceeded to tell me after a brief 15 minute conversation that my previous doctors had made improper diagnosis (four doctors over five years) and did not want to get into any discussions other than medication management.  I spent the better half of a week dealing with his staff, and the inability of Dr. Jackson to write a correct prescription, to get my medication order straight with my insurance provider.  Ultimately, Aetna solved the problem after he continually ignored requests from Aetna and I pleaded with them because I was running out of medication.  I would warn anyone considering him for their care as I felt as if he had no interest in helping me, or gaining knowledge of my conditions.  "
1816,39203,1.0," I think Dr. Jackson has been very helpful.  He has always been on time, and I have been late myself and it is understandable if you don't get a full session.  It's not fair to punish other clients out of their time if I'm a little late, it's just a consiquence of my own actions.   He actually listens, and asks questions at appropriate times, he also gave me a great referral for an attorny!  Thanks a MIllION "
1817,39203,1.0, I don't feel that I was treated with respect. I was misled as to the withdrawl symptoms of my medicine-I was told that there were none and that is entirely inaccurate. I feel that I was spoken to in a rude and inappropriate manner many times and I felt that my character was being attacked constantly.  
1818,39208,0.0, She does not know what she is doing. I was diagnosed by another doctor for a condition I had. She needs to go to Med School again. I felt worse coming out of her office than going in. 
1819,39210,0.0," Dr. Jacoby seems quite accurate with her diagnosis, at least in my case. She explains the situation, the procedures and answers questions. I appreciate her attention to the smallest details so that they don't become much larger. She's precise and to the point, highly professional and intelligent. I want that from someone who has my life in their hands. "
1820,39210,0.0," Easily the worst experience I've ever had with any physician. I saw Dr. Jacoby in 2007 for chronic UTI's. She did not give me much hope in curing my problems, and had very poor bedside manner. I was recently referred back to her to have a procedure done, and, if my husband hadn't been with me, I would have left the office in tears without having it performed. I will never go back to her for treatment. Even if she is a medically competent physician, she treated me so poorly I would prefer to see any other urologist in the area.  "
1821,39210,0.0," Actually, having to wait a few minutes to see a doctor can actually be a good thing--it indicates that she's willing to take time with her patients and actually help them rather than run through them really quickly just to stay on schedule. Personally, I'd rather wait and actually have a doctor hear me out and offer me informed assistance than have zero wait and essentially zero wait. If you don't want a wait, make an appointment first thing in the morning. I had a 7:30 a.m. appointment once and didn't wait one minute. Dr. Jacoby is a bit brisk of manner, but she genuinely cares about her patients and will fight like hell to get them full-service care. Plus her office offers more modalities of service than any other urology clinic I've ever seen.  "
1822,39210,0.0, All visits have been an exercise in patience. I usually wait at least a half-hour before seeing her. 
1823,39210,0.0,  
1824,39212,0.0,My husband and I have been going to Dr. Kelley since 1999 and very much appreciate her work and demeanor.  She's a great doctor and we recommend her for your dermatology needs. 
1825,39212,0.0,"she is the best! Every doctor should take a lesson from her on respecting patients and being non-judgmental.  She knows her skin, too! I have recommended her to many people "
1826,39212,0.0,"Dr. Kelly is knowledgeable for sure - she does a great job of listening to your issues and explaining your treatment options. She's also nonjudgmental, non-intimidating... truly just a nice person. I highly recommend her.  "
1827,39213,1.0,"I was honest with this doctor about my past, and he treated me like crap. Very unpleasant Doctor. "
1828,39214,0.0,"My 79 y.o. mom had surgery to remove a severely scarred section of her bowel.   1)We were given wrong post-op instructions; 2)At post-op visit,Dr.K was rude,e.g.,my mom's incision was still packed with gauze from surgery. Before we knew it, while she was dressed and standing, Dr.K pulled down her pants in the front and with his other hand stuck his finger in the incision and ran it across so that all the puss, gauze and fluid came out onto the floor. I have never seen anything so unprofessional.  3)My mother's scar is the worst stitch job-its crooked, lumpy, bulging...Just because she's old doesn't mean she doesn't care how she looks; 4)After surgery, mom's incision became infected. Dr.K put her on a 6-wk  high dose of antibiotics which almost killed her.   After about 4 weeks, Mom completely deteriorated, was delirious. I wanted to stop the meds- Dr.K said no, since we only had 2 wks left. Sure enough, the minute she was off the meds she got better and is now fine, no thanks to Dr.K.  "
1829,39214,0.0,Very caring doctor. He performed colon cancer surgery on me. He is so knowledgeable and definately knows what he is talking about. Everything that he told me was right on. Highly recommend him.  
1830,39214,0.0,Recent Colonoscopy. Freaked out about.  Staff and Doctor fantastic 
1831,39215,2.0,"Very helpful in making a referral with a specialist, when necesary. "
1832,39216,2.0,"Very helpful, personable, a good listener. "
1833,39217,0.0,"Dr. Karimi found out what I have (mild case of Crohn’s). I got to her after seeing 3 other doctors, one of them wanted to perform an unnecessary surgery. Dr. Karimi has been so accurate with the diagnostics, willingness to work with me to find out the best treatment and also respecting my desire to minimize drugs. She is special, sometimes it may seems that she is a little rude, as she may be short sometimes, but in the other way around, she is very sweet, so don’t get hung into it!  (I think it is just cultural). She has been always there for me, very compassionate and always gives me the feeling that she will be there when I need her, and she will understand. The most important thing is that she is the best gastroenterology I have met! "
1834,39217,0.0,"I have seen Dr. Kirimi twice now. She treats me with kindness &amp; offered solutions to a prob that I have been experiencing for a few yrs now since my gallbladder was removed. The &quot;sloppy&quot; surgeon had spilled the contents of the bile in to my body &amp; she felt that there may still be residue or a small stone left over that was the culprit of my pain &amp; RX'd me a medicine to disolve the sediment.  After only a few days of taking that medicine, I no longer have upper abdomen pain which would wake me up in the middle of the night. My other GI dr just told me I had too much stomach acid and to take a pill &amp; offered no other resolution.  I really like her &amp; have recommended her to my friend &amp; to my hubby.  The only thing is sometimes it is hard to hear her because she speaks so softly &amp; because of her accent, so you only need to ask her to speak up &amp; repeat what she just told you.  Then there is NO miscommunication involved.  "
1835,39217,0.0,Very useful session preparing for routine colonoscopy.  Dr. Karimi did a complete history and we found that I had an additional gastro problem that needed to be treated to prevent long term effects.  I will definitely go back to see her for any other GI need.  
1836,39217,0.0,"I have been seeing Dr. Karimi for over 10 years.  She is an amazing Dr. Compassionate, caring, patient. She has helped me through some of the worst times of my life. She is also the only Dr. that hasn't blamed every ailment on my weight. She listens, thinks things through, isn't afraid to order tests. She also is the first to say if she doesn't know about something. She refers out when she's at her limit or even when she thinks someone else will know more. Every member of my family goes to her now due to my great experiences. My father worked his entire career in the medical field (radiology specifically) and he respects Dr. Karimi more than any other Dr. he's met. Anytime someone in the family has something wrong, he says, &quot;Go to Dr. Karimi,&quot; or &quot;What did Dr. Karimi say&#63;&quot; because he knows she knows her stuff.  I can't say enough positive things about her.  "
1837,39217,0.0,"One of the worst experiences I have ever had with a doctor. I honestly felt like she didn't care, she didn't take the time to follow up after appointments or fully explain the results of my test. There is nothing worse than being in pain and looking to a doctor's help and finding none. On one occasion I waited close to 20min, hearing her and other patient giggling. When she finally came in to see me it was all business and at the end of our few minutes together she left the room without even saying goodbye. Her disregard toward me felt personal although there is nothing I can imagine that would have upset her in the short appointments we had. Even if she didn't like me for whatever reason, it is a doctor’s duty to treat each patient fairly and work towards resolving medical issues while provided good bedside manner. I feel that my visits with Dr Karimi were a waste time and money.  "
1838,39217,0.0,She is the only doctor who actually cared enough to listen about what was going on with me. She is very knowledgeable about the rare diseases as well. She's wonderful and I would recomment Doctor Karimi to anyone. 
1839,39218,0.0,"She is the best kids doctor, explaining everything in details to make sense. My kids love her! "
1840,39218,0.0,"Best doctor I've ever seen. She takes wonderful care of my son, but also me -- she takes time to ease fears about sleep, food, going back to work ... you name it. "
1841,39218,0.0,My kids love Dr. Keller. She always takes time to talk to them and listen. 
1842,39219,1.0,"He is not on our insurance's preferred provider list so lacks some of the discounts that another dentist would have, but he is awesome.  I will pay the extra cost to have a fantastic dentist because it is worth it to me.  "
1843,39219,1.0,"Dr. Kadoshima is the VERY BEST dentist anywhere!  We have taken our kids to see him since they were 2!!!  They love to play &quot;Dr. Mark&quot; when we help them brush their teeth at night.  His entire staff is very proffesional, yet very comforting.  I would recommend Dr. K and his staff a million times over to anyone that wants the very best possible care for themselves and their family.  "
1844,39219,1.0,"He is the best, gentlest, takes the time to listen to you, shows concern ~ Dentist I've ever been too. "
1845,39220,0.0,"Dr. Keegan is a great professional.She gives you confidence in yourself.I delivered two healthy baby boys :)Dr.Keegan treats patients  with compassion, dignity and professional care.  Her nursing staff are incredibly helpful and work to make sure any questions or concerns are taken care of in a timely manner as well. "
1846,39220,0.0,Dr. Keegan is straight forward with no bull. She will tell you how it is and give you options. She is thorough in her explanations and wants to give you the best possible care. I would recommend her to anyone looking for a new OBGYN 
1847,39221,2.0, 
1848,39222,1.0,"Both my husband &amp; I have been patients of Dr. Kenney's for years. We saw doc after doc until Dr. K diagnosed our problems. He's so knowledgable &amp; is supported by a top notch staff (his nurse Julie is AAA+).  Once my primary hadn't yet recv'd doc's notes from my last visit &amp; I simply called ANW &amp; explained the situation &amp; requested doc K's chart notes be faxed; the report was sent before the med-asst. could even get my vitals charted &amp; she could't believe a specialists' office would act so quickly. I've recommended doc to several &amp; everyone is impressed. In 1993 at 43, I'd given up hope but doc diagnosed me &amp; what a godsend. Many visits later, I've never read derogatory notes in my/spouses files &amp; although it may take time to get in to see him anymore, we wait &amp; count ourselves fortunate when we do, even w/a 2 hr ride ahead of us. His recall is incredible! He's the best, no doubt, I only wish there were more top notch doctors like him across the board.  "
1849,39222,1.0,"Maybe it's just the fact that after seeing many docs, I was sent to him and he figured out what was going on with me...that's why I liked him. However, after research, I see that it is usually is a RA dr. who usually makes the diagnosis for fibromyalgia. I only seen him once, &amp; his staff said since I didn't have RA that I would not follow up with him (though I do have osteoarthritis). It sounds like there's a common theme though...if one doesn't listen to him, or &#63;'s, then he makes sure to doc bad things in ones chart. Guess I might be glad that I only went once. "
1850,39222,1.0,"I have had a chronic condition (Lupus Nephritis) for over half my life.  The doctor did not listen to any of my concerns and called me a &quot;non-compliant patient&quot; because he was pushing a certain treatment regime that I have done in the past and wasn't too keen on repeating.  It was obvious in his manner that he believed his way to be the only way; this man was definitely on his high horse. When I requested a copy of my medical records and read the report, he had blatantly lied saying that he had informed me of certain risks associated with treatment when he hadn't. He has a big name in Rheumatology, so I assumed he would be a good doctor.  I was highly disappointed and will not be going back. "
1851,39222,1.0,Absolutely the best. Office runs very smoothly and yet is very busy.  Doctors and staff take the time needed and thoroughly check things out.  Wonderful experiences. 
1852,39223,2.0,"We've been at this practice since 1993 and even though we moved to Redmond, we still go to Dr. Kato and Dr. Mayeno. Kind, considerate, caring, always available. Staff is wonderful. Highly recommend. "
1853,39223,2.0, 
1854,39224,0.0,"Dr. Keller is the best infectious disease MD in this area.  He is a very kind and compassionate person and is very knowlageable in his field. His RN Kathy is the best... her blood draws do not hurt,... and I hate needles!    I cant say enough good things about Dr. Keller.  He's saved my life.  I've recommended him to several friends, all who have been grateful to have him as their MD.  Well worth the waiting time to get an appointment with him. Free parking, short wait time in office, and the bus stops right in front of his office!  Way to go Dr. Keller!  You are the best! "
1855,39224,0.0,"Very busy doctor, Appointments can take over 2 weeks to get. I've found that getting in early means a faster seeing the doctor time.  The RN Kathy is the greatest for blood draws, never any pain! That's a plus for me "
1856,39225,1.0,"I first consulted Dr. Kaplan in 1988 when I wanted a second opinion on the treatment I was receiving at another medical center.  Dr. Kaplan reassured me the treatment was appropriate.  I returned to him several times after that for follow up and referrals to other physicians.  He always gave me good advice and good referrals.  He always returned my phone calls.  Finally, he saved my life when, as a 19 year survivor of the BrCA, I consulted him for a check up.  Something extremely small on a CAT scan cought his eye and he followed it closely with imaging over the next 8 months.  Finally, he referred me to a pulmonologist and surgeon for a possible lung ca.  Those doctors followed me for a few months and finally diagnosed lung CA.  I lost one lobe of my left lung in 2007.  The lesion was still very small.  Without Dr. Kaplan's suspicions and close following, the CA probably would never have been discovered until was too late.  I owe him my life.   JS "
1857,39225,1.0,The best care anywhere! I love Hank and I love he wants to keep me alive! I actually love the whole Swedish experience from Anthony and Angela in reception to the gentle vein pokers in chemo and the upbeat friendly radiation team.  
1858,39225,1.0,"He has been my doctor for 18 years.  Marvelous in every way.  Compassionate, extensive fund of knowledge.  Answers ALL my questions.  I never mind if I have to wait a bit, for I know he has taken extra time with me when it really mattered.  Cancer needs extra time sometimes.  I tend to make appts. at the beginning of the day.  I recommend him without reservation.  "
1859,39225,1.0,"I trust dr. Kaplan with my life.  He has earned that trust over the seventeen years he has monitored my remission from a rare cancer.  I don't need to know everything about my disease because he does. And, even though I revere his expertise, I also feel that he is my friend.  "
1860,39225,1.0,"Best doctor in the world - doesn't chat much, but spends time with you when it's necessary and is able to filter out all the other chaos in the clinic. Is totally committed to you from initial appointment to remission. I trusted my life to Hank, and I'd do it again.  Everyone at Swedish Cancer Center from the receptionist to the pet-scan tech is first rate! "
1861,39225,1.0,"Highly conscientious, but is unable or unwilling to answer common questions or provide patient teaching about care options, or to provide others who will, ESPECIALLY any questions about medication effects other than remission. If you don't want to know much about your cancer and only want reassurance about recommendations, he's a great guy.  "
1862,39225,1.0,"Dr. Kaplan is the greatest. Not only is he an excellent doc, but a genuinely nice and caring person.  "
1863,39225,1.0,"Hank is one of the best doctors i have ever had. He is caring, takes the time to explain his diagnosis and walks you through the medical options you have.  I highly recommend him because i don't know many doctors that devote so much time to their patients "
1864,39225,1.0,"Highly competent and caring, and excellent if you do not want to know much about your disease or treatment options. "
1865,39225,1.0,"Excellent Dr. Kind, caring, compassionate. Knowledgable. Listens, takes his time with you. Makes you feel your input and well-being are important. "
1866,39226,1.0,This man does not to work with young children. He has some very serious problems. Do not take your children too him! 
1867,39227,2.0,Excellent wisdom tooth extraction.  Knowlegeable explanation beforehand. 
1868,39228,1.0,This is a very principled chiropractor.  I highly recommend him to everyone.  
1869,39229,0.0,"Her staff does not get back to you at all, terrible doctor that prescribes oxycotin, methdadone, and suboxone to drug dealers, says she take insurance but went in today to get help and her staff said &quot;we dont take any insurance, cash only, wich ranges to $360 to $75 deposit. heard she takes methadone a very killer drug herself... dumb "
1870,39230,0.0,"Dr. Kary is amazing. The staff is SO nice and helpful. Dr. Kary knows exactly what to fix,and how to get it done. I have been to many chiropractors in Ca. and Wa. Dr. Kary is the best yet. I feel safe with her. "
1871,39230,0.0,Open minded and willing to listen.  Her treatment of me was very helpful. 
1872,39231,1.0,I love Dr.Katsman! He is a very nice person and a professional in his field.  
1873,39231,1.0,Dr. Katsman found out the cause of my problem after other doctors spent months trying.  A year later he did the same for a relative after other doctors could not diagnose the cause of her problem.  I would highly recommend Dr. Katsman to others.  
1874,39231,1.0,"I agree with the above helpful when you can get ahold of him, however he isnt one you will see coming around to your hospital room, while I was admited I saw other people from the same office but didnt seem once in the room. He was at the hospital one time for rounds to perform a colonoscopy but during the 4 weeks that was the only time I saw him. Disapointing really when he was the one I would see in the office.  "
1875,39232,1.0,"He isn't helpful.  Didn't test, respond overall.  He's just there.  "
1876,39232,1.0,"His famous last words: &quot;Let's give it another six months and if you aren't doing better, then come back&quot;. He said that for EVERYTHING, never diagnosed anything and had no &quot;answers&quot; to feel better.  "
1877,39233,1.0,"After seeing several gastros for my two autoimmune liver disorders, I finally found Dr. Kang several years ago. I couldn't be happier with the care I receive from him.  He listens carefully to what I say, invites my participation in my care and is always a pleasure to be with, as is his assistant Sharon.  All my family members go to Dr. Kang when needed.  He's an angel.  "
1878,39233,1.0,"Absolutely the best doctor anyone could ask for.  I've seen Dr. Kang for over 20 years, first for a serious illness and then over the years since for regularly checkups.  He is patient, kind, extremely knowledgable and at the top of his field.  All my relatives see Dr. Kang as well  He is the best!!! "
1879,39233,1.0,Dr Kang is the best. He takes his time answering questions and you know he cares about you. I've known him for 15 yrs. He also took wonderful care of my husband who had cancer. I wish I could see him for everything.  
1880,39233,1.0,I have had two colonospanies (spell) with Dr. Kang over the last 10 years.  He explains everything that is happening and I feel very at ease and relaxed with him.  I highly recomment Mr Kang.  
1881,39233,1.0,"Great gastro doc.  He is personable, patient, listens to detail, and does a great job explaining the treatment he recommends.  I highly recommend him.  Office staff is very nice and helpful.  "
1882,39233,1.0,Excellent gastro doctor. Is very thorough and keeps close watch on my problem since major surgery.  I feel very comfortable and confident that my previous condition(pre cancer) will be caught in time if it reoccures.  
1883,39233,1.0,Clearly the best in his field that I have delt with.  
1884,39234,2.0,"Was transferred to Dr.  Kennel from previous retiring md, not warm or friendly at all, poor bedside manner "
1885,39235,0.0,"Wonderful, knowledgeable, caring! Ob/gyns are notoriously behind schedule because babies seem to have their own agenda. Keep in mind that the patient she has spent extra time with, likely needed it,wouldn't you have wanted her to spend the extra time with you had the roles been reversed&#63;   Ok on to my review.. I waited two months for an appointment too see Dr. K. I had been told by many how great she was and banked on the wait time being worth it. It was. She spent at least an hour with me during my initial consult. When we had came to the decision to have a hysterectomy, she arranged to do a co surgery with my general surgeon who was already planning on taking my gallbladder out. We talked extensively about options, what ifs and I left the office totally comfortable with my choice. She called the night before surgery to see if I had any concerns,she explained everything to my husband afterwards and stopped in to see me again later that afternoon.  She is by far, the best doc,ever! "
1886,39235,0.0,"I waited in one of the little rooms for her for an hour with my baby, undressed, covered in only one of those little paper sheets.  She came in and then told me she was going to go see another one of her patient and she would be back to see me.  WHAT&#63;!&#63;!  She left and saw the other person first even thought I had been waiting longer.  Lots of excuses of why she was late and why she saw the other person first but she never did say she was sorry.  She really didn't care about me.  I wouldn't expect any different treatment for anyone else. "
1887,39236,1.0,"He lied to get me into his office.  I told receptionist I did NOT want surgery, but needed to continue alcohol injections from a DPM who skipped town.  I had 5 injections and needed someone to continue.  He lied to get me in, listened to my story, then told me he won't do the alcohol because it will damage my foot.  Duh, that's the point.  He only wanted to do surgery...LOTS of money in surgery!  That's the only reason he got me in there.  Of course he refunded my money, but no apology.  I received a lame form letter, thus prompting the writing of this review. "
1888,39237,0.0,Totally awesome doctor. Easy to talk to...never feel rushed. She's Great!!! 
1889,39238,1.0,"Dr. is very caring and listens to you and is genually ooncerned.  He is extremely knowledgable and does not hesitate to recommend other specialists if needed.  He is excellent in handling complicated cases and takes a conservative approach in his treatment plan.  I can truely say that he is one of, if not the best Dr. that I have had throughout my life which has included living in all parts of the country, east to west and north to south including cities with major medical centers.  "
1890,39238,1.0,"William I found to be a very kind and knowledgeable, I would recommend him to anyone. On the other hand the staff that answers the phones and greets the people in the office are not so good. They must be from the younger generation that simply do not care much about anything.  "
1891,39238,1.0, 
1892,39239,0.0,She is amazing. The staff is nice and really competent. I had a c-section and healed really fast. Shaunie is fantastic.  
1893,39240,2.0,Very caring and knowledgable.  Takes time to explain diagnosis in detail and answers all questions in terms the patient can understand. 
1894,39241,2.0, 
1895,39242,1.0,Dr. Katz is good at time management and very personable.  He uses comprehensive blood test results to look for issues that past doctors never investigated such as Vitamin D deficiency.  When an issue is beyond his general practioner expertise he recommends competent specialists.  
1896,39242,1.0,"Dr. Katz is knowledgeable, helpful and easy to talk with.  "
1897,39243,1.0,I would not recommend this Dr to anyone!  He couldn't answer my questions I had to ask reguarding my Grandfather. 
1898,39243,1.0,"This is a typical card carrying AMA oncologist that although friendly is simply dispensing the chemotherapy poisons and making a mint.  On my wife's first visit, he rapidly said that her cancer had a poor prognosis without giving us time to even let it soak in.  His staff is pleasant and efficient, but he refuses to acknowledge any alternative therapy or even dietary help.  He simply follows the &quot;protocols&quot; that the drug companies give him.  After a series of treatments, he said the protocol called for a 30 day resting period.  After returning, he said &quot;oh, another month wouldn't make any difference.  BUT, after a CT Scan after that period, he said &quot;Oh, things are much worse.&quot;  While my wife was responding well to the first treatment, I lost her less than 4 months later.  I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND Dr. Kasubhai to anyone.  In fact, if I came down with cancer, I would follow alternative therapies and not consider radiation OR chemotherapy at all.  "
1899,39245,1.0,"Dr. Michael Keehn and staff are very professional, caring and friendly. Been seeing him for about 6 years due to an injury at work. I will have to have a little more than maintenance chiropractic and massage for the rest of my life. It's always enjoyable going in to see him. He and his staff are very personable and make you feel welcome besides making you feel instantly better. Thanks Dr. Mike!!! "
1900,39246,2.0,The staff in this office was AWFUL! My advice to anyone who chooses this facility be very aware that they will provide services not covered by insurance and then slap you with a surpprise bill before you leave! The worst part about the whole visit is Dr.Karbassi was the one accumulating the charges w/out discussing it with me! 
1901,39246,2.0,Friendly staff and caring dentist. Gave me treatment options. The best! 
1902,39247,1.0,We've had great experiences with Dr. Keblawi. He's always been very helpful and our kids like him.  
1903,39247,1.0,He's very friendly but I think has taken on way too many patients.  
1904,39247,1.0,"Very friendly physician who works in a very busy (much too busy) practice.  His friendliness doesn't make him a good doctor though.  He has poor follow thru (ie: after moving, I went over records and discovered at least three abnormal findings that were never brought to my attention..) Like someone else mentioned, he would try and reassure my real concerns away...about things that needed to be addressed and looked into.  He was always in a hurry, and so much just fell thru the cracks. We are so thankful our children are no longer under his care.  "
1905,39247,1.0,"This man is scary and has poor attention to detail.  I have 2 children that he failed to correctly diagnose and treat on multiple occasion.  One of these children has suffered long term speach issues as a result of not diagnosing multiple ear drum perforations.  This child was also having eating issues as a result of chronic unresolved ear infections.  The pattern was to minimize our concerns and reassure us out the door.  It took demanding a developement check and subsequent ENT and hearing appointments to realize that there was scar tissue from undiagnosed and multiple perforations.  I later lerned that recurring ear infections of this nature make it painful to eat, another complaint of ours was was feeding difficulty and continued low birth weight.  Our concern was regularly minimized and told that it was because he was born small.  Bottom line, my feelings about this doctor are very hostile.  For his sake I hope I never run in to him.  A new doctor in our case was very revealing.  "
1906,39247,1.0,"My 3 kids saw Dr. Keblawi for a couple years. He was really good at first, but his care and quality of care declined rapidly. It seemed to be more about how many patients he could see and less about getting to the bottom of recurring issues. We spent alot ot time going to emergency rooms and walk in clinics for recurring issues he should have been pursuing. Now we have a new doctor and our son is finally improving from a condition that he kept saying was a virus. I am not a Doctor, however most kids don't get 12 viruses in a 6 months without the rest of the family getting sick. In addition to this we knew two other people who each had 3 kids from our church. They all left him for other issues. In addition to this it is extremely difficult to get an appointment. When you do get in the appointment is so quick that you will be lucky to get your questions answered. I can say that the staff at Rockwood clinic is very nice, as is Dr. Keblawi. "
1907,39247,1.0,"He comes in very well prepared, the kids like him, he is very concerned, and provides detailed out-patient instructions, plus will go the extra and even stay late to get your child in if he knows its important. He also implements common sense protol in his clinic to try and get as many seen as possible throuout any day.  Awesome "
1908,39247,1.0, 
1909,39248,1.0,We have seen him for the last 14years. As good a family Dr. as one can wish for. Thank you.  
1910,39249,0.0,"Dr. Kesling nicked my uterine artery during a hysterectomy and left me in the recovery room for about eight hours where I received 6 units of blood and almost died (BP 68/33) before going back into surgery. He told me he was waiting to see if the blood would clot. He also said &quot;I have to catch a baby, but I'll be back to check on you.&quot; I wasn't taken back into surgery until I told the nurse that my feet were numb and could barely breathe--she immediately paged Dr. Kesling. I spent that night in the ICU. This was a terrifying experience, and I would never recommend this doctor to anyone.  "
1911,39250,1.0,"I had a great experience at Dr. Keller's office. I found him to be quite personable and kind. I HATE going to the dentist, but love coming here. He always remembers previous conversations we've had from other exams, which shows me he does listen. For the person who was unhappy because of the appearance of the office, I disagree. Yes, some detail inside is a tad outdated, but at least it's CLEAN and sanitary. I'd be more concerned with that aspect. I moved to Seattle, and wish I could still see Dr. Keller!! I do recommend this DDS to friends/family. "
1912,39250,1.0,"What a joke this office is.  Always someone new working there.  This guy cant seem to keep his staff.  His office is very old, not to mention so is he.  He shakes when hes working on you mouth.  SCARY!!! .  The dental chair is Yellow from the 1970's and is fuzzy. The first time I was there I thought that his staff forgot to cover this chair, but I don't think thats the case because I returned for another visit and it was again not covered.  It gets worse then this.  There was a ring in the toliet and the floors and base boards were nasty. I picked this Doctor because he belongs to my network but I am so grossed out I cant ever go back.   This guy needs to RETIRE!!! "
1913,39250,1.0,WOW! what an office.  The doctor is great and the staff is wonderful.  I needed a few fillings and they were able to get me in around my work schedule.  They gave me an estimate of my treatment.  I was surprised that I had no pain during the filling or after.  Everything went so smooth.  I have finally found a dentist that I like seeing.  If your looking for a new dentist Dr Keller is the guy.  Thanks Dr Keller and Staff 
1914,39251,2.0,"Really takes charge and coordinates all treatments needed by all the specialists, I was a mess and needed to be seen by 3 different specialists and no one knew what the plan was until Dr. Kang got involved.  Very pleasant and friendly office! "
1915,39251,2.0,"Very pleasant and helpful office, along with knowledgeable doctor. Took the time to explain all the options and spent the time to answer all questions. Treatment was as explained and painless. "
1916,39252,0.0,"Dr. Kelly is a fantastic OB/GYN.  She's very down to earth and caring.  I would not have wanted anyone else to deliver my 2 babies.  With 2 c-sections, my recovery time was almost nothing and I have the tiniest perfect scar.  I even delayed a move out of state because I didn't want to have someone else deliver my baby. "
1917,39252,0.0,She was a great doctor!  I felt so comfortable around her and she didn't make me feel stupid for asking any questions.  Very informative and polite. 
1918,39252,0.0,"Dr. Kelly is awesome. She is very clam and answers all your questions, and takes her time when listening to you. I would highly reccomend her to anyone looking for an OB/GYN. "
1919,39252,0.0,"Spectacular Doctor and Staff! I had my third son with her. I had been through a horrible delivery with my last OB, and had a midwife with the first in a military hospital. She is wonderful. I actually look forward to my annual, because of her kind bedside manner.  "
1920,39253,2.0,". Not a good doctor, very poor follow up "
1921,39254,0.0,She was great!  Very helpful and knowledgable and friendly.  
1922,39255,1.0,Very good doctor with a great sense of humor. Doctor Karp is skilled in all aspects of medicine and has a lengthy history with an exceptional education.  His staff is professional and caring and the office is comfortable with convenient access. 
1923,39255,1.0,I had a tummy tuck by Dr. Karp and he did an excellent job.  He is such a good doctor.  I highly recommend him for tummy tucks. My navel is amazing.  Thank you Dr. Karp even after 6-7 years. 
1924,39255,1.0,Very happy with my results from breast augmentation surgery. Dr. Karp did a fabulous job and his staff was exceptional.  Would highly recommend them to anyone. 
1925,39256,1.0,"his prior job was in Washington as a chemical dependency counselor (doctor), at a Longview clinic that prided themselves on getting people off drugs.  However if you have real pain issues which need to be addressed, this is not relevant to him. I suspect &quot;Pain Relief Specialists&quot; in Gresham , Oregon, simply hired him to go through all the patients and drastically cut their medications, which is very unprofessional imo. "
1926,39257,1.0,"Dr. Kestell is a great doctor. Unpretentious, great listener, and very skilled. He was the 3rd specialist I saw, and finally! an answer and treatment. Wonderful 'bedside' manner and easy to talk to. Thank you. "
1927,39257,1.0,Obviously he is in it for the money by prioritizing colonoscopy's and endoscopes.  I waited 3 months for office visit as did my father for a follow up. 
1928,39257,1.0,"Dr. Kestell is the epitome of the term &quot;good doctor.&quot;  He's compassionate, understanding, genuine, and excellent in terms of both knowledge and people skills.  And, since I know a lot of medpros, I hear what they say and no one's ever spoken of him in less than enthusiastically admirable terms.  I don't know how he does it, but as a physician and as a person, he seems practically perfect in every way.  I agree with an already posted comment - he should be cloned.  We could use a whole medical industry of people exactly like him!!! "
1929,39257,1.0,"When my gastroenterologist retired, I was skeptical of a new one but Dr. Kestell exceeded every expectation I could have possibly had.  He's intelligent, knowledgable, approachable, flexible; he listens AND hears; and he not only cares for conditions but cares about people.  If cloning were perfected, I'd nominate him to be cloned for the medical industry.   Excellent doc - in every way imaginable! "
1930,39257,1.0,"I was one sick individual,I got my normal life back.Always offered options,never pressured.Very helpful with questions or doubts. Very understanding and compassionate. I would recommend him anytime.  "
1931,39257,1.0,"I was completely misdiagnosed more then once. First, I have a lot of scar tissue and no IBS next I allegedly have a milk protein allergy finally I now have IBS. They preformed a lower and upper GI, a lactose intolerant test, blood work for celiac disorder and a biopsy for that too. Come to find out I had Guardia and I took 7 days of antibiotics and now can eat anything and feel great!!! This I self diagnosed with internet research and a doctor that finally listened to all my symptoms.  "
1932,39257,1.0,"If skill and a caring personality are both important to you in your doctor search, you will appreciate Dr. Kestell.  While he is very straightforward and knowledgeable, he is also very compassionate.  I felt addressed and cared for as an individual rather than as a medical condition or a dollar sign. He was very approachable and not rushed at all. I left his office feeling well-informed and comfortable with the extent of the information I was given.  I highly recommend Dr.  Kestell! "
1933,39258,2.0,Treated me with respect and listened to every thing I had to say.  Did not rush me.  Now my eye doctor for life.  
1934,39259,1.0,"My mother had a life threatening complication in her spine (C1-C3) that most doctors attempted to avoid due to risks involved. Dr. Kamson spent weeks preparing for the surgery and readily sought assistance/advice from his colleagues. Due to his commitment to medicine and his patients, Dr. Kamson saved my mothers life--I will forever be grateful to him.  He's a very passionate doctor, and I would highly recommend to anyone in need of orthopedic medical care! "
1935,39259,1.0,I am a college athlete who was injured in my sport and was told I would be sidelined for 6 months at the least. I then saw Dr. Kamson and he performed a procedure on me that worked wonderfully and that helped me return to action in just 3 months.  The other doctors and physicians I saw were amazed by the results from the procedure. Great doctor. Very knowledgeable. 
1936,39259,1.0,"Great doctor! Might be running late sometimes but i had great results with the disc herniation removal in my lower back. Good staff, the nurses were pretty knowledgeable of the procedure done.     recommend overall .  "
1937,39259,1.0,"I had surgery with Dr Kamson 2002 with great results. My leg numbness and back pain went away, and I was able to go back to (light duty) work after one week. "
1938,39259,1.0,"For a pain specialist, Dr.(salutation used loosely) Kamson has no compassion for pain! I've been waiting for 2 months for surgery with no updates as to what's going on. I ran out of pain medication during my wait and was given the run around for 2 1/2 weeks then told I wouldn't be able to get my medication without a &quot;5 minute appointment&quot; with him. Anyone who has seen Dr. Kamson knows the wait time is between 2 and 3 hours. When I asked him to mail me my records because I was going to find a new doctor, he hung up on me. I have yet to receive my records.  The WORST doctor experience I've ever had - and I've had a lot! "
1939,39259,1.0,"I find a series of favorable accounts all dated within a close span of time very suspicious. Yes, this Doctor can be very nice and act concerned as long as you have procedures that bring in the big bucks. Oh and he will recommend them whether you really need them or not. Yes, he will give you a very convincing explanation.I'm telling you from personable experience over 4 years this will change abruptly once there are any unsolvable problems or error on his part. He literally threw me out of his office. He WILL alter or lose important records. All my MRI's and Xrays disapeared! Once dismissed, because of his reputation you will be blacklisted by other docotrs!!!!  They don't want to deal with his failures.  Try getting any disability help with no doctor support! "
1940,39259,1.0,"Mr. Kamson is NOT a credentialed surgeon.  Click the Wa. State review board actions against him. (at the top of this page) Also, scroll to the bottom of this site and read what others have said previously.  Check King County & Snohomish County court records involving Mr. Kamson before you EVER consider a proceedure by him.  My personal surgery did nothing to help my condition and increased my pain. Instead of requesting another MRI to see what was wrong, he suggested that I have a stimulator implanted.  Be VERY careful, and obtain many opinions (from board certified surgeons) if surgery should be considered.  There is no going back on your decision.  You will have to wait, sometimes for up to 3 hours, for your scheduled appointments with Kamson.  The majority of all his patients (that I saw there) do not speak english, and that concerns me that they are not understanding what is being told them.   Beware!!  Notice his specialty at the top of this page: ANESTHESIOLOGY!!! not surgery! "
1941,39259,1.0,"Super doctor,I had a spinal cord stimulator put in on May 2007.The doctors were very knowledgeable and nice.These doctors have the cutting edge technology and use it well,very professional.Dr Kamson and dr Massey are the best.I highly recommend the Spinal Institute Northwest in Bothell Wa. Jerry Harrison "
1942,39259,1.0,"I was refered to Dr. Kamson in 2003- he said that with the procedure he uses, I might be able to have a life of playing with my grandchildren- After a cervical procedure in 2003 and listening closely to his instructions I overcame the headaches and no pain to my neck- Recently I just found out that before surgery my spinal cord was not centered in the fluid and now it looks better. In 2004 I recieved a lowback surgery where I was told I would not be able to bend from the waist and cheerkicks-- Upon leaving his surgery center I went home and proceed to follow his instructions of icin my back for 10 days 24 hours-- to this day I have no scare tissue build up and I do the things that amaze me and Dr Kamson. I was told I woud never be able to bend from the waist I do that without pain- also not to kick above my waist I am able to jump off trailers woithout any interuption to my movement. As for any medication I barely used it-- only after surgery to sleep the first 10 days. "
1943,39259,1.0,"It was one of the worst experiences ever. I had two physicians see me. the first was an asian dr, forgot the name. He was constantly stuttering and seemed so un educated and frankly just made me nervous! Soon Kamson came in to discuss my problem. Stated that only surgery will be the answer, wanted to do an endoscopic discectomy on my low back which hurt from a ski accident. I went to a chiropractor a day after this appointment and he just said i had a few pulled muscles and nothing wrong with my disks or spine. the staff was loud and the girl up front had a thick accent i could not understand. i was also asked to pay my deductbile up front!! i never had been asked that before!!! I was given so much paperwork to do that its ridiculous!! and a electronic test which seemed more psychiatric then spine related. Their office is nice and looks really expensive. I am not surprised if appointments are so expensive here just to pay for the office. my advice is do not try this: "
1944,39259,1.0,"Lost all mt MRI's he insisted had to be kept there. Other records destroyed, Billing - good thing I know Business Accoiunting. Bills already paid reappear a year later. A lot of double billing too. Also does unnecesary tests to see if you need surgery in his Surgery Center. I had a sore neck , he gave me a Back Discogram. "
1945,39259,1.0,"I too was operated on in 2001 after the discogram supposedly read 3 levels needed to be fixed. He later admitted they found out later 3-level didn't work. I am after all this pain trying to get on Disability. I too lost a job of 25 years due to needing to be reclined or on ice to maintain any comfort. He wanted to see me after 90 days, when I got there and waited..he rambled on and on about himself and why was I there, then I heard &quot;not to bother his staff anymore about prescriptions, etc&quot;. He has you on so many meds then cuts you off. He billed over $40,000 then a year later he comes up with another bill for an additional $30,000+ for facility use. I had to find another doctor and has since been on narcotics every 3 1/2 hours and can't stand for more than 5 minutes and leaning forward is out of the question. In the beginning he and the assistant were so excited how they could &quot;fix&quot; my lower back pain when nobody else could. I am worse off than before and all savings are gone. "
1946,39259,1.0,Thank goodness his reign of terror has been interupted. He's an anethesilogist - not a surgeon. Unfortunately anyone with a MD can do these procedures. It is Spine surgery! I was told it was safe to do over abnd over again - and due being increasingly worse after each surgery - told to do another surgery. He works with a LA neurosurgeon and between the 2 of them my savings is wiped out and they now have a lien on my property after the insurance comapny refused to pay for the last surgery.I'm now disabled after losing my job of 21 years. He personally kicked me out of his office after exhausting all possible money making procedures. He and the LA docor kept me in the dark as to what transpired during surgeries - finally all I could see was the PA and he said he knew nothing. He tells you not to seek any other opinion since these doctors misunderstand his work and will mislead you into complicated cripling surgeries - and he didn't&#63;!&#63; To make things worse no other doctor will treat me. 
1947,39259,1.0,"I wrote a complaint to the Quality Assurance Board in 2001 following treatments he gave me to help my cervical / shoulder problem following an accident,he did not explain the risks of the procedure or even how much steroid medicine he was giving me. My first treatment you could have scraped me off the ceiling when he inserted needles into the sides of my neck with no pain IV. then yelled at me not to move. That evening when I developed a horrible rash, and couldn't lift my head off a pillow, he did not answer my pleas for help. I broke out in a rash. His 4 treatments cost my auto company, health insurance & settlement over $44,000. It was not uncommon for his medical bills to exceed the liability limits on the insurance policy so he was paid,and the client was ripped off. Shame on him, $44,000 exceeded my 2 orthoscopic shoulder surgeries, MRI, physical therapy, neurologist, Overlake Hospital. I have thyroid problems brought on by the Steroid's and still to this day have neck problems! "
1948,39259,1.0,"Surgery in 2004 to implant spinal stimulator. He put the unit in the wrong place too close to my spine, I could never lay on my back. After an auto accident, I was in unbelievable pain and Kamson would not even see me for an appointment; he said it &quot;was not his problem.&quot; The Doctor that finally treated me, said the stimulator had to be immediately repositioned, and could not understand why it was there in the first place, that nobody ever put them that close to a patient's spine. He could not believe Kamson had refused to see me, and said it was a &quot;breech of ethics.&quot; Kamson has had his State license temporarily suspended pending an investigation, and when I called the State to request the complaint forms, they told me the phone had been ringing steadily all day, with other patients asking for the complaint forms. His license should be revoked - and he should not be allowed to practice medicine ANYWHERE. I do not know if I will ever recover completly from his incompetence. "
1949,39259,1.0,"He is exellent in term of surgery, at least now he is good. He probably does 200 cases a year. Over past 7 years, 1400 at very least. Complication is rarely at least now. compared with other spine surgeon not bad at all. "
1950,39259,1.0,"I agree with all comments above. Dr. Kamson is rude and arrogant. I had cervical surgery in '03 and my neck has never been the same. When challenged on current conditions of pain he ignores them and disregards it. Passes the patient on to his P.A. I'm so glad the light has been spotlighted on his misdiagnosis of true trained medical career. And, yes I have waited 3 hours for an appointment also. The assembly line has finally been stopped for Kamson! "
1951,39259,1.0,This Doctor finally had his License to practice pulled in WA state for unnecessary procedures and harm done to patients 
1952,39259,1.0,Ditto on previous comments. I've routinely waited hours only to see his PA and get no answers or medical information I know is incorrect. He is rude and arrogant when crossed. Treatment and tests are scheduled at his facility and very expensive - especially his MEDX program. 
1953,39259,1.0,"Very poor service, mis-diagnosis, runs the office like an assembly line. Everything is an angle to make money "
1954,39260,1.0,My 3 children saw him when they were young now my 3 grandchildren see him.  I HIGHLY recommend him!! 
1955,39260,1.0,good doctor 
1956,39261,1.0,"Dr Keizur keeps up with the latest information in his specialty and he does know what he is doing.  I would not hesitate to go to his office again for prostate and urinary problems.  He can come across as abrasive, but I don't care, since he is very competent.  "
1957,39262,1.0,"Dr.Craig has been seeing me for a couple weeks now because of a upper back and neck pain and I couldn't be happier with the improvements I've made so far with his help.  I haven't seen the other doctors at Midway Chiropractic, but they are always very friendly. My family has known Dr.Craig for years and I would refer anyone to this office.   Amazing experience, very helpful.  :-)   Nicole W "
1958,39262,1.0,. Best doctor I have ever had! Very caring like family takes the time to help YOU! Great employees comfortable environment 
1959,39262,1.0,they are the best at what they do. i go in they work on my back && walk out feeling better than ever. the massage there are to die for releases stress. i would not go nowhere else but midway chiropractic. the doctors there are 5 star they know what there doing. 
1960,39262,1.0,"I woke up one morning and had a shoting pain going from my back all the way down my leg.  I am a very healthy guy and have never experienced this much pain before.  I managed to get up and go to work but within the hour I was hobbling out the building.  I am a Veteran and went to the VA.  They did some nerve induction therapy which did nothing at all to relieve the condition or pain.  I visited this clinic because it was close to my house and from the moment I walked in, I was greeted by friendly staff.  I was called in within 10 minutes, given and xray and diagnosed within 20.  I was given chiropractic care that day and scheduled for three weekly session and within one week, the pain was managable.  Within 1 month, it was non-existant.  I have to say, Dr Kagetsu is absolutely one of the TOP Chiropractor's in this State.  I would choose no other.  There was no price gouging and inflated treatment request.  Just an accurate assessment of my condition and treatment.  Excellent!!! "
1961,39262,1.0,"Dr. Kagetsu has cared for my spine during the past 9 years.  He is an excellent chiropractor and human being.  He cares for the total person, takes time to listen, takes great care writing correct notation, in order to help a person.  I had a work injury, and if not for Dr. Kagetsu, I do not believe I would have gotten the correct treatment, the correct diagnosis, via MRI, and his &quot;in office&quot; physical eval. I am so pleased that this doctor, stood up for me, so that I could get the correct diagnosis, when &quot;Work Injury doctors&quot; tried to wash their hands of my injury, physical disability, and curry the employer.  Dr. Kagetsu was, and continues to be more interested in helping a person with a disabling spine injury, get the best treatment, diagnosis, and follow-up for as healthy a future/recovery as possible. I would give him 100 stars if I could.   His treatment and personhood helped me heal emotionally from this physical trauma, which in term helped me heal/adjust to my spine disability "
1962,39262,1.0,"Excellent Dr! I was in very bad shape when I went in there. For the first time in years, the pain cycle in my head was broken. His treatment on my back and legs have helped keep my out of a wheelchair.  "
1963,39263,1.0,. wonderful doctor talks in laymans terms very nice office staff is also very helpful dr comes out to waiting room to greet you can not recommend him enough 
1964,39265,0.0,Very polite and pleasant. Excellent bedside manners! Took time to listen ..would recommend her to anyone!! 
1965,39266,1.0,"If you want results this is the Doctor to see. He is experienced, and has a lot of good information. "
1966,39267,1.0,"Excellent surgeon.  Very fast recovery time, little pain.  Highly recommend.  Staff helpful, knowledgeable.  I was a new, out of town patient and they very accommodating.  Dr. Khalfayan clearly knows his business and was interested in my outcome.  I would return to his care in the future if needed.  "
1967,39268,2.0,"Both the Medical and Dental offices in this company have left my either in pain or have given me answers that have been proven false by other MD's. The ladies at the front desk are helpful and nice, but the Doctors seem unable to perform minor tasks such as fillings and physical health exams. I would never ever visit them again, and will make a point to let others know of their lack of knowledge in the medical field. Two thumbs down for this company "
1968,39269,1.0,A kind gentle and very caring and professional man. Always keeps up with the latest treatments and works with the patient.  Always see's me as a person not as a set of symptoms! Really nice guy 
1969,39269,1.0,Smart doctor who actually listens to his patients and is truly helpful.  Highly recommend him. 
1970,39269,1.0,"Very friendly, thorough.  Welcomes questions & gives suggested course for treatment & alternatives.  Discusses concerns.  Good at answering questions via email - answers quickly.  Only 1 physician in this office.  It can get crazy at times, but he always apologizing when patients have to wait.  Often can get appointments with short notice.  Doesn't take appointments on Wednesdays & late afternoons of Friday.  Often takes his own after-hours calls.  This guy is great with folks of all ages.  Even my teenagers like him.  "
1971,39270,1.0,"Found Dr. Kennedy to be very concientious.  However, trying to get a messge to him or get a copy of my Rx has been a nightmare.  Always connected to a nurse/assistant who NEVER returns calls...never a &quot;live&quot; person.  Have made 3 attempts so far with no results and have even had the pharmacy fax them.  I think this is really bad client service.  Never had this kind of problem with any other provider.  "
1972,39270,1.0,"My mom and dad had dr Kennedy as their cardiologist. My oldest son has heart issues and it's nice to know he knows our history. Beyond that we've been self pay and he's been great. I'm a single mom too so it's been tough. He's caring, concerned, intelligent, has a good bedside manner and will go the extra mile for you!  His nurse Lyanne* is worth more than she'll ever know! "
1973,39271,0.0,"First of all Dr. Kellert is mainly a OBGyn, or so she says. She delivered my first child, and we were happy with her performance. We went in for our second pregnancy and things were very different. This one was harder,  and she always seemed annoyed to see us. 2 months in I had bleeding, called the office and she did not call me back at all, in fact had a nurse call back 6 hours later... scary for a pregnant mom! 3 months in I had bad sciatic pain, normal, said the nurses, as she does not call back. I went in and she did not seem to believe how much pain I was in and blew me off. She prescribed Tylenol and told me to go home. 4 months in, I was in screaming agony and she basically threw up her hands and said I don't know how to help. Now after MRI's, CT scans, bone scans and more it turns out I a tumor in my sciatic which look like cancer. I called to let her know last week, and she still has not called back...I won't hold my breath.  "
1974,39272,2.0,For 15 years I have only the very best attention and care from Dr Kern.   Absolutely first class 
1975,39272,2.0,"I think that the doctor performed surgery on me that was not neccessary by taking very small biopsies. When i went to another doctor for a second opinion this new doctor took a slightly larger biopsy that cut 100% of the cancer and let me avoid an hour surgery, which saved me pain, inconvience, and money. "
1976,39273,1.0,Dr.Kahn has been my dr for 6 years. He is a great Dr. He is always there if you need him and has helped me when I didnt have enuf money for help I needed he let me pay payment.Dr kahn is not like the cartel. Im assuming the person the wrote that is someone that doesnt use there meds as percribed. Thanks 
1977,39273,1.0,"Although he is great about giving out any drug you want, he treats his business like a drug cartel. Even worse, he shows up at any time he feels like it. Office is closed at random times with no notification. He gets you hooked on meds, forces you to sign contracts so you can't them anywhere else. And on top of that charges outrageous fees. And he leaves the financial side to somebody who lives in another country who never returns phone calls. "
1978,39274,0.0,"The staff is ridiculous. I've told them they can leave a message on my phone I don't know how many times, and they refuse to do so! It's a constant game of calling each other back!!! SO ANNOYING!!!!! - that is IF they even call you back!!!- Dr K is good- Staff -stupid. "
1979,39274,0.0,"Dr. Karmali has re-invented primary care.  During the appointment she exudes a positive presence and sits down to LISTEN to you. I never had this kind of experience with any other health practitioner - ALSO, I get a typed personal letter from Dr. Karmali with an overview of my test results and wishing me luck on nursing school. This is &quot;above and beyond&quot; primary care, this is when you know your provider is looking out for you. Exceptional.  "
1980,39274,0.0,"Dr.Karmali is THE BEST doctor I have had in my 61 years. She gives her time to listen to  an old patient like myself,explains well, treat me like her own family.  She is one of a kind.  "
1981,39274,0.0,Zahara is one of those doctors that actually takes the time to speak with you and understand you. She is very thorough.  
1982,39275,1.0,"He is an excellent dentist! Very helpful and patient. He will work with you on what you feel needs to be done first, unless there is a really good reason why you should do it differently. "
1983,39275,1.0,"Dr Kay is always friendly and prompt. I have only seen his hygenist Larry and he incredibly knowledgable, helpful and always gentle. They take good care to make sure the patient is in great health overall.  "
1984,39276,0.0,"After two years of following my research and my disease, Dr. K agreed with my findings and agreed with the research presented - which called for a radical approach to a progressive and potentially deadly condition - but on next visit her composure and personality were that of a different and institutional doctor - no longer willing to fight for my health, instead taking the company line and offering me lots of meds for the *symptoms* of my disease.. but never went after the *disease* itself, knowing from research that it's progressive. She was often late with getting me needed Rx's. Personally I found Dr K to be a nice young woman and easy to talk to before that last visit. Someone in fam practice doesn't expect to get a complicated disease as a case.. I understand that, but she promised to fight for me and broke that promise.  "
1985,39277,1.0,"Totally awesome. Perfect in every way.  You can have total trust while under his care.  Unbelievable to have found him, in the mists of such horrid doctors out there.  I only drove 2 hrs to clinic, but would fly cross country for surgery by Dr Keck.  Highest recommendation !!!!!  Seriously! However long it takes or however far you have to travel -this is who you want to perform your surgery!!!!!  My surgery ,which included a tendon graft, is 2yrs old and I still am so thankful to Dr Keck. "
1986,39277,1.0,"Dr. Keck was a very rude person.  The first appointment he said thAt he needed my records from UW.  After hand delivering those items and at my second appointment, he was late, dud not look at my records or my scans and told me to go to an accupuncturist dismissing.  I felt like he does not care, just wanted the money and never intended to help.   I would Not recommend this doctor for anything! "
1987,39277,1.0,"I had carpal tunnel surgery by Keck. First of all, he sent me back for another EMG,  even though I'd had the test 3 weeks prior, by the same neurologist.  I've waited up to 3 hours past my appointment time for him and staff never offered an explanation why so long until I went up to the front desk and asked.   The surgery center was like an assembly line - surgical staff was icy and in what seemed to me to be in a big hurry to get me out and next patient in. But the surgery worked. 6 weeks after the surgery, I had an accident and reinjured my hand.  He sent me for another EMG and the results showed that the carpal tunnel still there.  Dr. Keck said that carpal tunnel must not have been my problem. If it was, He would have fixed it.  He refused to do anything more for me.  Told me to see someone else. Dr Keck's ego interferes with his ability to be a good doctor in every way. Very condescending, grossly lacking in compassion with the bedside manner of a Kleenix.  "
1988,39277,1.0,"Had new thumb procedure for arthritis, which was well explained and agreed to.  The results were only so so however.  And a larger than expected lump resulted at the thumb joint. I still go to the dr. for cortisone injections.  "
1989,39277,1.0,I've had several hand surgeries from Dr. Keck and find that the only problem...and it's a BIG one...is his punctuality.  I sometimes waited up to an hour!  I never got in on time. 
1990,39277,1.0,"I was early for all appointments, often with 'first in the morning' times and still waited at least an hour in the lobby - and waited in the exam rooms. Prepare to spend the balance of your day waiting. I have nothing to say to convince you it's worth the wait.  "
1991,39277,1.0,Dr Keck is a great hand surgeon. His office staff is some of the worst I've ever seen. Constantly late with little concern of keeping patients informed. Plan on waiting 1 to 2 hours past your scheduled time. 
1992,39278,2.0,"very knowledgeable, answers all questions re: technique, etc, makes suggestions as to other things you might do to improve your health "
1993,39279,0.0,"I cannot recommend North Pacific Dermatology after my initial visit to their Renton office. After a 30 minute drive, I arrived at their office for an 11:30am appointment five minutes late due to traffic.  Once in the office I waited in line while the single receptionist at the front desk was on the phone with another client.  That client was placed on hold while the receptionist helped the next woman in line.  Dr Kageyama and the receptionist then took the next five minutes to help the woman locate an appropriate time for her next visit. During this time, another client in the office was ushered back to their appointment. When the woman finished scheduling her appointment I informed her that I was there for my appointment.  She excused herself and headed back to talk with an associate (I assume the PA).  After she returned I was told that I would have to reschedule. I looked at my cell phone, and it read 11:42am. I didn't bother to argue, politely rescheduled, and left never to return.  "
1994,39279,0.0,"I was told when I made the appt that I could only see her for what I mentioned, anything else required another appt.  She spent approx 6 min with me.  Cost over $300 - was looked at and had a skin tag removed - no biopsy was done.  Told me to see a specialist then when I tried to go to one, she denied telling me to do that.  Probably wanted me to pay for another appt.  "
1995,39280,1.0,i HAVE RATHER AN INVOLVED CASE WITH CARDIAC ISSUES AS WELL AS ASTHMA.  HE HAS BEEN IN CONSTANT CONTACT WITH MY PRIMARY DR. AND MY CARDIOLOGIST.  I AM PLEASED.......... SO FAR SO GOOD!!! 
1996,39280,1.0,He misdiagnosed my condition.  I was taking the wrong medications as a result. 
1997,39280,1.0,"Excellent specialist: knowledgable, helpful and resourceful. "
1998,39280,1.0,"This doctor is great. He is so friendly and put my mind at ease even though I came in with a scary case of asthma. He took really good care of me, answered my million questions, and helped me get on a plan where I rarely feel like I even have asthma.  "
1999,39280,1.0,"Total Jerk.Gave me an epidural in his office without using proper procedures.Just used alcohol and injected it DEEP and next to my spine.Caused vaginal bleeding,nausea,dizzines and weakness... and headaches now for 3 weeks.Called him said not his problem!!Beieves other people over his own diagnosis......makes me wondering if he has a clue! "
2000,39281,2.0,Does not care about patients.  It takes a long time to get things done. 
2001,39282,2.0,"wonderful, absolutely perfect, the office ran on time, the hygienist was gentle, and the doctor spent more than enough time with me and listened to all of my questions and answered each of them patiently.  "
2002,39282,2.0,A guy who when making a mistake dosen't care and don't know how to fix it.....stay away or put 1000 questions before starting something with this doctor....  
2003,39283,0.0,"Dr. Kelty has been my OBGYN for over 15 years.  She has been an amazing support through difficult times and has always provided a wealth of knowledge and was extremely patient with my endless questions.  I have never minded waiting if she was running behind, because I knew that would not affect the time she spent with me.  She is simply a doctor that gives every patient the time and care they deserve.  I think that is a quality that is pretty hard to find these days! "
2004,39283,0.0,"Unlike the other people here, I did not experience a wait longer than 5 minutes. Dr. Kelty performed my first pelvic exam and was very respectful. In addition, I was seeing her for some other issues and she was very knowledgeable on the subject and had many different treatment approaches lined up. Her staff was very friendly and everyone treated me with respect. I would recommend Dr. Kelty to anyone because I had such a positive experience with her. "
2005,39283,0.0,"Like other responses, Dr. Kelty never met my appointment time. I waited once for over an hour. My biggest concern is that she did a surgery to remove a fibroid tumor (at that time 1 cm) and couldn't find it. She told me that it must not be there and gave me a different diagnosis. Over three years she never checked for it. On year four she noticed it because it was 10 cm. She then told me I needed it removed immediately, that it was probably cancerous, and at 28 that I would need a hysterectomy. She was wrong. It was not cancerous and I found a doctor to remove it without losing my uterus. She could not even tell me where the fibroid was  located. The doctor that did my surgery didn't find any signs of the other conditions she claimed I had. She did other procedures that her nurse even said was unnecessary. Over the time period, she lost a lot of nurses and the last one was unprofessional enough to come into the room, grab some tools while swearing, as I waited 20 plus more minutes.  "
2006,39284,2.0,". Excellent service, good patient care, good communication "
2007,39285,2.0, 
2008,39286,1.0,Dr. Kaine is awesome. He is great with teen agers. He truly cares about you. 
2009,39286,1.0,Excellent doctor.  Wish everyone would have a doctor with this much compassion.  A very personable and professional doctor who really cares about his patients. 
2010,39287,0.0,"I am overall pretty happy with her service. I am comfertable around her, and she is extremiley nice and careing. waiting time is long sometimes, and i normally do get a response from her the same day i call,the staff is very nice. overall everything is good. Dont really have anything to complain about.  "
2011,39287,0.0,"she doesn't make me feel comfortable. she is over controlling about unnecessary things, reschedules you to come in multiple times to get very small things done. this costs me more because i have to pay for a new visit each time, in addition to the minor procedure. to get something even as small as a note from her, it takes repeated trips, and follow ups on my end that are completely unnecessary. I can't trust her or the office to take care of me, that is why I changed doctor offices completely. I suffered immensely and was not taken care of there. She was terrible.  "
2012,39287,0.0,"she's usually over booked. she's controlling when it comes to referrals, even when its been ordered by another doctor in the same office and another doctor at an urgent care. It takes too long to get in touch with her, you're on hold at the front desk for 20 minutes before they even know what you need. By the time you tell them, you're told she will call you back when she can. If you miss her call, there is no number to return it, it starts the process over again. Communication is difficult with her and the office. They communicate between sticky notes.  "
2013,39288,1.0,"Dr. Kerr is an amazing man with patience, hard work, and a copasthetic attitude.  He puts you and your needs first always, no matter what.  He made having my first child a once in a lifetime experience that was positive an unforgettable.  "
2014,39289,2.0,Worst bedside manner ever. Better off at the ER 
2015,39290,1.0,I didn't start out being very impressed with this docutor as my 1st appointment was cancelled without my knowledge and my 2nd appointment ran 1/2 hour late and my 3rd appointment 1 hour late.  I now know to call ahead to find out how far behind he might be running.  I have an unusual problem and have been to multiple doctors beforee seeing Dr. Kanter.  He was able to diagnose and treat me.  I'm doing great now thanks to him.  He listens and actively answers my questions.   He is heavily booked and tends to run late so bring a book! 
2016,39290,1.0,"I wondered about coming here when they requested a credit card before they would make my 1st apt. Then they sent me some notes with the very first paragraph all about missed apt fees. $250.00 if a 1st time patient doesn't cancel with 48 business hours notice....  Dr Kanter never asked why I was there. He asked questions &amp; hurried my answers. When I tried to ask a question, he put his hand in front of my face and said he needed to focus! He then rushed out. "
2017,39290,1.0,"I made an appointment today on 6/8 @ 10:30am with Shawna at Dr Cantors office...very helpful and made an appt for 6/22. three hours later the office whatever &quot;Stephanie&quot; called my boyfriend to say they were not taking any new patients&#63;Does this make any sense&#63; My belief is that this is a personal issue of Stephanies, and Dr Cantor needs to be informed of this.  Thanks Cheryl Greeny "
2018,39290,1.0,"I was ffiteen minutes early for my appointment, however I had to wait thirty mionutes past my appointment, befor I was seen.  He asked questions, for which he had the answers in front of him. Then he charged my insurance company $466.00. I have to pay him $79.00 of that bill.  How can I trust a Doctor that thinks this is ok&#63; "
2019,39290,1.0,"I was told I my have to wait and I DID, I brought a book like they said in their reminder call and when I arrived, they said Dr Kanter was running behind. I waited about an hour after my appointment time to get into a room. (My friend said I would) I wasn't happy until I left mu appointment and I KNEW just what to do, how to do it, when to do it and WHY! I have NEVER had such a thourough physician! Dr Kanter was AMAZING! I now KNOW what to do to take care of MYSELF! MY face to face time with Dr. Kanter was THREE HOURS!I KNEW someone else MUST be late because of me so when I was leaving I stopped at the next room and looked in. I told the woman sitting there I was sorry but that I was the reason she had had to wait so long. She just said to me..... Dr Kanter ALWAYS cares more about ME than the CLOCK! I never mind having to wait to stay healthy! I WILL ALWAYS recommend Dr. Kanter ... with a warning.... BRING A BOOK AND YOUR PATIENCE!!! THANK YOU DR.  KANTER "
2020,39291,2.0,"Good Doctor, but office is dirty and paper covering on office beds are not changed. I don't believe this office is sanitary. "
2021,39291,2.0,Dr. Koa insists you come back every two weeks for just a dry skin condition.Seems everyone comes back every two weeks for any reason. Very difficult to get out of this revoling door.  Never changes white paper on bed everyone leans on. Hard to understand. Office and patient room seem dirty with so sanitizing between patients.  
2022,39292,1.0,"Great staff, nice office atmosphere, Dr. Kae is easy going, knowledgeable, very caring, and most important, very gentle.  O, and he only recommends what is necessary, unlike my last dentist who wanted me to pay for thousands of dollars of cosmetic work.  "
2023,39293,1.0,"Kafrouni is a thinker, and he stays on your case like it really matters to him as much as it does to you.  He, in my opinion, is a miracle worker, because I am now pain-free after 17 years of anguishing with intense nerve pain, spasticity, and mental stress as a C6 quadriplegic! He is the best! "
2024,39294,0.0,"Very knowledgeable &amp; diagnosed a medical condition in 10 min that drs had missed for 29 years.  I feel so much better &amp; am confident in her ability to provide very thorough care.  She's not a big chatter, but I go to her because of her medical knowledge &amp; not to chat about life.  "
2025,39294,0.0,"I first made my appointment for elbow pain, but have many joint problems which began in childhood.  Shortly before my first appointment, I developed severe weakness in my right arm.  She went on to order diagnostic tests of my neck and nerve studies, but never looked at my elbow.  When those tests came back normal, she became hostile and accused me of faking it so I could quit working.  I sought help from another rheumatologists and was found to have a muscle tear as well as a tumor in my elbow.  "
2026,39294,0.0,"I had a long wait to get an appointment.  Impressed by thoroughness in getting medical records and imaging results before appointment. Also was able to fill out questionaire before appointment. She took her time and asked individualized questions versus other doctors, just standard form questions.  I had one question and she answered it in more detail than I am usually accustomed to from other doctors.  "
2027,39294,0.0,"I was in the middle of a painful flare-up, and after waiting three months and driving thirty miles to be seen, I arrived for my first appointment with only a debit card.  Nancy herself refused to see me without my copay, so in tears I went out in search of an ATM. I had switched to her hoping to find a compassionate, caring, helpful and informative Rheumie.  She prescribed me medications without describing the side effects, never responded to my concerns about my ever decreasing abilities, and somehow managed to never answer a question I asked.  I was disappointed as well as disheartened with the level of care she offered.  Those with chronic illness are uniquely vulnerable, and she was unable to connect with me as a person.  "
2028,39295,1.0,"No dr is worth waiting 1.5 to 2 hrs every single time. Dr Kennedy is nice, bit NOT worth the wait. Plus he didn't even end up delivering my baby. The female dr did, and was way nice! "
2029,39295,1.0,"I was told by the staff at the hospital that DR Kennedy is the best and that's who most the head nurses used. My dad is a paramedic for S. Kitsap and called to ask them who they recomend. I have heard that he has saved many lives, new borns and moms alike from random people that I have spoke to. He is not always on time but it's worth the wait. I had a crying break down from being frusterated with my 2 year old while I was there last week and he was so nice and just gave me his full attention and encouraging words. With my first pregnancy I had to be induced because of pre-eclampsia. After it didn't take he explained he wanted to send me home other wise if they kept going with the treatment he would most likely have to give me a c-section, he gave me the option, instead of taking the easy way out that a lot of DR's do and just doing surgery. DR Kennedy and his staff are amazing. I have never, ever left there feeling dissapointed. I'm now 7 months and going to him with my 2nd:) "
2030,39295,1.0,"Dr. Kennedy was the worse medical experience I have ever had. He was always 1.5-2 hrs late for appts and was never apologetic. I had heart conditions, and medicine that needed to be monitored and he flat out said he was happy to prescribe them but not monitor them. When confronted with the lack of care from his nurse, and Medical assistant he was immediately offended, started shaking and even mocked my person before he got up and said he refused to provide myself or my baby with care. I was later discharged from his practice with no reason given. I did not use foul language or raise my voice to him, but simply said I am not happy with the care your team has provided. (Not returning phone calls, prescribing medication without giving a reason or telling me what it was for...Which he later said was the pharmacists job.) When I finally ever did get into the office he did not give me the time I deserved to answer my questions, after waiting for almost two hours. DO NOT GO TO THIS DOCTOR. "
2031,39295,1.0,I have been going to Dr. Kennedy for many years.  He has always been kind and helpful.  Have recommended him often! 
2032,39295,1.0,"Dr. Kennedy is great! I had him for my prenatal care appointments and he assisted during the birth of my son. He is open to varying personal beliefs about child birth. I felt very comfortable with him. He does take his time with his patience to make sure all their questions are answered, so this may be the reason that punctuality is lacking. I highly recommend going to Dr.  Kennedy! "
2033,39295,1.0,". I love doctor Kennedy!  He delivered both of my babies, gave excellent advice during my pregnancies and even gave my HUSBAND medical advice since he was with me one day!  I see him at church, too! "
2034,39295,1.0,Go to ANY other doctor. Dr. Glen Christen in the same building is WAY better. Do NOT NOT NOT let Dr. Kennedy operate on you. I've had chronic pain ever since he operated on me over two years ago. He's ALWAYS at least an hour and a half late and was completely unwilling to continue helping me after the pain persisted- probably because he figured it was his fault.  
2035,39295,1.0,"Dr. Kennedy was excellant in his care and attendance to us during the pregnancy, during , delivery and during follow up treatment after complications with a c section. WE had absolutely no reserves putting our only child that we waited years to concieve into his competent hands... And were far beyond pleased with the care he took with us! We also would like to mention his professionalism and ethics . He is a awesome obstercian and person. And we cannot recommend him highly enough. "
2036,39295,1.0,Dr. Kennedy is terrific! He is very knowledgeable and takes the time to explain anything and everything to his patients--which likely is why promptness is not one of his strong suits. He delivered both of my babies and took excellent care of me when I developed pre-eclampsia. I cannot speak highly enough of this man. He is a fantastic doctor and person. 
2037,39296,1.0,He asked me to wear makeup and a dress to my next session and to basically &quot;buck up.&quot; He made me very uncomfortable and more depressed than ever. 
2038,39296,1.0,He doesn't mess around. I like that in a doctor. 
2039,39297,0.0,"she seems to busy to listen and cuts you off as you are telling her the symptoms you are suffering from. She will stop you mid sentence, walk out of the room, and her nurse (who is very nice and keeps things running smothly)appears to give you a perscription or whatever....but basically she cannot handle more than one medical problem at a time. which does not work well with complicated diseases like conective tissue diseases/R.A./Lupus/ect...doesn't believe you and tends to &quot;dismiss&quot; alot of your symptoms as &quot;In Your Head&quot; if she does not know about them Insted of just saying..i dont know. this has caused problems as New Dr.s read this and stop giving me the real care I desprately need in a crisis situation such as when I have to go into the Hospital . she might be good for someone with just arthritis..her nurse works really hard to make up any shortfalls and keep the place running well...have to give credit where credit is due... "
2040,39298,2.0,"The absolute best doctor I have had contact with. Listen, cares, and follows up on care. No doctor has ever come close.  "
2041,39299,0.0,Was the doctor for all three of my kids gowning up. Always amazing and caring to tell.  Always go above and beyond to help her patients 
2042,39299,0.0,"You could not ask for a better pediatrician than Dr. Katsh. She is extremely knowledgeable and never seems rushed. She takes the time to explain things and has an excellent manner with both kids and parents.  We drive an hour to get to her office, and would drive twice that much- she is great! "
2043,39300,1.0,"Dr. Kain and his assistant T, are 2 of the most amazing doctors I have ever met! They have taken such great care of my son,(who almost lost his arm), they caring and skilled knowledge has giving my son a new outlook on his future. Thank you Dr Kain and T, for being 100% amazing! "
2044,39300,1.0,"Went to Kain for a 2nd opinion. He was 45 minutes late, rude and self important.  Said &quot;I don't know what is wrong with you&quot;, even though he had MRIs, exrays and surgical reports.  Did not listen to my answers to his questions, and was miffed when my wife dared to ask a question and told her &quot;I'm talking to him&quot;. Kept calling me &quot;guy, and making odd jokes and telling stories about his family. What a waste of time, money and emotion. "
2045,39300,1.0,"I have had Dr. kain as my doctor for years.  He did a total knee replacement for me, a Laminectomy, and performed disc repair on S-1 S-2 L-3 L-4 L-5. He refered my to another Dr. for ultrasound treatments for Vertible artery Stenosis. At 68, I hike, move and swim better than most kids. He takes the time to be your best Doctor.  He is a miracle worker and a descent, compassionate man.  R.  Gingrich "
2046,39300,1.0,"I went to Dr. Kain I had a compression fracture and degenerative disks.  I asked him what would cause this and he said&quot;you're just lucky&quot;(his idea of a joke,I didn't think it was very funny "
2047,39300,1.0,"Had an appt for ulnar entrapment. He said he asks all his patients 5 questions, have they ever been physically abused, do they have any immediate relatives who are alcoholics, do they have immediate relative who are drug addicts, have they ever been sexually abused.  Based on any positive responses to these questions he said studies have shown the liklihood of any surgery working for these is close to 0.  I do not drink, do drugs, smoke, gamble, beat my children, overeat, etc, etc. Two things...I told him if that's the case I better go home and beat my family since some studies also state that once beated they usually beat (give me a break) and after researching 7 people who have been his patients (3 woman, 4 men), he only asks women these questions.  &quot;But&quot;, he thought he should do surgery on my neck...I don't think so.  We later found out I have double-crush Ulnar nerve entrapment in my arm.  Find a different doc, this one is too stuck on himself.  "
2048,39300,1.0,"this doctor has something against overweight people and seems to be getting kick backs fromt Weight Watcher.  He stated he would not help my wife unless she lost 100 pounds, which she has already lost 50 and quit smoking.  He was rude and seems to only care about the money he can make. "
2049,39300,1.0,"I am a secondary health provider.  I see patients from a lot of surgeons and MD's in my practice.  It is indeed rare to find a surgeon whose patients do not critisize.  Dr. Kain seems to have a great &quot;bedside manor&quot; (his patients seem to love him!), but every surgical outcome I have witnessed has been positive over a span of 5 years. "
2050,39301,1.0,"I just started seeing Dr. Keller, my boyfriend has been seeing him for years, and we love him. Wonderful work, very gentle, hardly felt it, and he was very kind and friendly. He has cured me of my headaches I've suffered for years with a TMD orthotic (he doesn't like it when I call it a mouthgaurd)  I'd definately recommend him. I have to say, the other negative reviews on here all seem to be SUSPICOULSY SIMILIAR in language&#63; I think it is someone with a personal grundge spreading lies. Whatever, I'm very happy with his work. "
2051,39301,1.0,Dr. Keller provided me with the best care I have ever received from a dentist. He took his time to walk me through the procedure before we started which really helped me feel more at ease. He is more than worth the cost. Definitely someone I'll refer me friends to. 
2052,39301,1.0,Don't pay attention to the reviews here they are clearly from competing dentists trying to knock down the most popular dentist in the area. I'm a long time patient of Dr. Keller’s and he has always treated my wife and I in a manner that is consistent with his great reputation that led me to him years ago. I brought some of these reviews to Dr. Keller's attention and it was a laughable matter to him because of the outrageousness of the comments. These people should be ashamed of themselves for writing these atrocious things.  
2053,39301,1.0,This Dr. and whole office were the VERY best!!!!I can't even describe how important it was that Dr. Keller was the one to give me my new smile. This is the only dentist I have trusted in 40 years!!!!! Worth the drive and money for such quality. I have moved out of state and there is still no comparison. 
2054,39302,0.0,"She's a great listener and takes her time with each patient. My only criticism is that she made a referral at my request, but failed to tell me what she was actually referring me for. Any possible diagnosis of my problem was not discussed...I found out what I was actually going to be checked for from the referring doctor's staff. Unfortunately, I'm looking for a new doctor. "
2055,39302,0.0,I have been a patient of hers for a few years now at the Sumner clinic and have always found her to be very knowledgeable and helpful.  She will sit and listen to all of my questions. I never feel like she's got her hand on the door knob waiting to leave.  
2056,39302,0.0,Won't go back! 
2057,39303,2.0,.  
2058,39304,1.0,I had an ear infection that would not go away. Another specialist told me to ignore it. Dr. Kennedy did surgery on the ear and I got my hearing back.  
2059,39304,1.0,"The minute I walked into the office the atmosphere did not feel welcoming. I saw this doctor and was not impressed by him or any of his staff. I got a lot of gloom and doom and found the doctor to be very arrogant. By phone, I was given an incorrect diagnosis by a nurse, later changed to the more correct and benign diagnosis the following day when I called with a question. In addition, the expensive antihistamine prescription that was prescribed did not help whatsoever creating more problems than before &amp; eventually I had to return to the OTC medication I was taking before. "
2060,39304,1.0,This doctor will do surgery when it is not needed.   I cancelled my surgery two days before and was better within a few days without surgery. 
2061,39304,1.0,". very competant, sometimes a bit brusque, staff always cordial "
2062,39304,1.0,Dr. Kennedy did paint doom and gloom at first but also was aggressive with testing which I prefer.  He was able to shed some light that no one else had told me about in 4 years of searching and directed me to the right doctor I should see.  
2063,39304,1.0,"Office staff have quite a sense of entitlement. If you are going to this doctor, be ready to put up with a staff that feels they are doing you a favor by dealing with you.   Dr Kennedy gave a proper diagnosis and preformed a successful surgery with good results.  "
2064,39304,1.0,beware this doctor is doom and gloom ! He will present worst case scenario and quick to schedule procedures with little explanation. Interaction with patients leave little to be desired. I am going for a second opinon. 
2065,39305,1.0,"Dr. Kappelman is friendly and professional. He has been my primary doctor for over a year. I am healthy and so have only been to him a couple of times, but I am quite pleased with the care I have received.  "
2066,39305,1.0,"I am 76 years old, and therefore have seen rather a good number of doctors in my lifetime.  Dr Kappelman is among the very best of these. He is very knowledgeable, extremely competent both with diagnoses and proceedures, and he is a keen listener, who is especially adept at figuring out what it is that his patient is suffering from and what it will take to make it better.  I am fairly well up on the medical issues that affect my health, and always find Dr. Kappelman respectrful, but with some data that are important but which I was unaware of.  I'd recommend him highly.  In my 76 years I've never had a better doctor.  "
2067,39305,1.0,"Dr. Kappelman is both rude and stupid, he proceded to tell me to give my 7 week old baby water ( can't have till 6 months) and then gave tests with no results. He also told me that he would need to do test that turned out to be completly unnessary and is an idiot, told my mother that her swollen feet and legs were just her &quot;ass falling to her feet&quot; it was pre diabetes.. thanks doc! your a real trooper. he should lose his licence! "
2068,39306,1.0,"Dr.  Karlin, was very nice, he listened to me and didn't wast my time, he ordered some work and knows what he is talking about very NICE MAN! he knows his profession, he is my new doctor  Thank you "
2069,39307,0.0,"Dr. Asha, helped me to conceive my son. She is a very caring person and she loves her patients. Too bad she move away to San Diego. She was there when I lost my twins and she was there when I gave birth to only son. Great doctor!! Dr. Asha God bless you for all that you do "
2070,39307,0.0,Dr. Kamnani problem solves and gets the job done! She is honest and compassionate. She is truly informed and strives to educate. She is the ultimate physician.  
2071,39307,0.0,"Being 18 and going to the gynecologist was a scary experience but she made it so much better. Her office staff is super friendly and when I was led back to her office the nurse said that she is known for her gentle touch. We sat and talked in her office for about 15 minutes about my medical history and about any questions or concerns I had. Then it was time to change into the gown, which was cloth! That helped me not feel like a piece of meat. She was very gentle and would tell me what she was about to do. She was open to questions and I felt like I could talk to her.  She is also very interested in holistic medicine and gave me the name of a great acupuncturist who I see for neck pain! "
2072,39308,1.0,"dr. kersten worked on a torn bicep that i had on easter of 2011. the job was excelent.  and besides the great work that he did, he called me on EASTER to see how i was. thanks doc. a 1-5 rating i would give dr. kersten a 5 "
2073,39309,2.0,Very responsive to patient needs! Flexible office staff re schedualing. Cost reasonable. 
2074,39311,0.0,"A VERY CAREFUL, CONSIDERATE DOCTOR. SHE LISTENED TO ME AND DID NOT MIND WHEN I ASKED QUESTIONS - ALL OF WHICH SHE ANSWERED IN FULL. "
2075,39311,0.0,Sioban knows her trade  and acts decisevly 
2076,39313,0.0,"Dr. Nelson was kind and listened well. She had am amazing depth of knowledge and helped me form a treatment plan that I could do, and it worked well for me. I love that she knows other options to help Lyme in addition to &quot;another pill&quot;. "
2077,39313,0.0,Worst ND you could possibly have treat you. Thinks she knows everything and really knows nothing is very rude and opinionated.  She claims to have Lyme disease herself if this is the case  she should cure herself before experimenting on others with her witchcraft. 
2078,39313,0.0,Thank God she is here - FINALLY I have someone who understands what I have been going through and is helping me get through it and beyond it! 
2079,39313,0.0,"She knows what she is doing, I see her not only for the area of expertise she specializes in, I've been so helped by her with my specific health issues that I also choose to see her for general health such as annual exams etc.  I would not trade her for another doc.  Nice to have her at a new location too in which she seems to have more effective and helpful office staff as well as resources in general.  I recommend her services to anyone, whether you fit the areas she specializes in, or even just general medical stuff.  Sometimes she is on time, other times around 15 minutes behind.  This seems to have improved with better backup at her new clinic. "
2080,39313,0.0,This woman is AMAZING...she makes it clear when there are needed lifestyle changes.  And she has been 100% spot-on with everything that I have thrown her way.  She has changed my life in only 3 visits.  
2081,39313,0.0,I believe my life has now been saved due to Dr. Nelson. She took the &quot;Oath&quot; and fulfilled her promise to heal! 
2082,39313,0.0,"Dr Nelson has an encyclopedic yet practical knowledge of Chronic Lyme Disease and its treatment. I just wish she was an MD rather than a ND. MDs don't know**** about this disease and don't care. Dr. Nelson cares a lot (and is effective), but insurance companies don't honor naturopathy. "
2083,39313,0.0,"Dr. Nelson knows her stuff. She is a Lyme Literate Naturopath. As there are many treatments for Chronic Lyme and alot of controversy surrounding them, I don't always agree with Dr. Nelson. However I respect her and trust her information completely. When I am indecisive between a recommendation that conflicts with her beliefs I am apt to try her approach first. She also has Chronic Lyme herself so has personal experience along with clinical knowledge in fighting this disease. "
2084,39314,1.0,I had been shopping for a new dentist and already had 2 strikes when I was referred to Dr. Nelson by a co-worker who JUST LOVES HIM!  Seems like he is just getting his own practice up and running so the office isn't the fanciest or most organized.  I was not impressed by his office staff either.  But I was definitely impressed by Dr. Nelson - he seems great!  All I've had so far is a cleaning (which he did himself!) but I am ready to build a dental care plan and long-standing relationship with him.  He was very patient in explaining my x-rays and answering all my questions. 
2085,39314,1.0,Very nice and thorough. He answered all my questions and was super friendly. 
2086,39315,0.0,"Dr. Nalty is concerned, helpful, caring and above all, accessible.  She really does care about her patients and WHO they are, not just what they pay, and takes the time with you during appointments.  "
2087,39315,0.0,Dr. Nalty is very personable.  She is very caring and makes you feel like you are the only patient she has.  
2088,39315,0.0,I have been a patient of Dr. Nalty's for 20 years. Even though I moved an hour and 40 minutes from where she practices I have kept her for my doctor as well as now my family uses her. She is the best doctor I have ever seen and is well versed in a lot of areas which makes her the best family doctor. She makes herself fully available to me and my family for questions and medical advice.  I would not travel this far to keep her as my doctor if I didn't feel strongly that she is the best there is! 
2089,39315,0.0,"She is the best doctor I have ever seen. Spends time with you and explains exactly what you need, very personal. I love her.  "
2090,39315,0.0,"I am extremely happy w/ Dr. Nalty. She's very personable and knowledgeable. She is willing to work w/ her patients to find common ground, as well as concerned with my satisfaction and comfort in dealing w/ my migrane headaches. It's actually taken me 22 years to find a doctor that's willing to help me find the right combination of preventative medication to control my migranes. I do not have a single bad thing to say about Dr. Nalty.  "
2091,39316,0.0,I like Dr. Lucy because she is very honest. If she is not comfortable treating a condition she will send you to the right specialist. During my pregnancy my OB was horrible.  Dr. Lucy cared very much and was able to prescribe the correct medication for me.  She is very patient with people like myself who have multiple medical conditions and depression.  She has also always sent me to great specialists when I have needed them.   She truly cares about her patients!!! 
2092,39316,0.0,Dr. Nguyen is a no nonsense kind of doctor that talks very very fast.  I was a new patient with Fibromyalgia and she told me she could help me with a couple of refills but that she doesn't deal with Fibromyalgia.  In other words you need to find someone else to help you. 
2093,39316,0.0,"I love Dr. Lucy.  She really cares about her patients, and she is very knowlegable about a variety of medical issues. "
2094,39316,0.0,genuinely listens and is willing to try different avenues to help you feel your best. 
2095,39317,0.0,I loved having Dr. Norland as my OB. I was TERRIFIED when I had my daughter and she was so supportive. I also really connected with her nurse/assistant and enjoyed my visits with both of them.  
2096,39317,0.0,I was looking for a new OBGYN because I wanted to get prgnant and I had a strange ultrasound a couple years back indicating I might have PCOS. I &quot;interviewed&quot; Dr. Norland and she was very upbeat and positive encouraging me that everything will be fine. I wanted to believe her. I had my annual with her and I asked to see the ultrasound of my ovaries. She blew off my request saying everything was fine. I finally went to a fertility doctor because I wasn't having normal cycles and sure enough I have PCOS and it's very obvious on the ultrasound. Dr. Norland didn't even look at it! Would not suggest seeing her if you want someone that's going to listen to you. Plus her nurse is not engaging nice or friendly.  
2097,39318,1.0,"Fabulous Doctor!!  I highly recommend Dr. Novia! He is so kind and loves his job!  I had a breast augmentation and couldn't be happier!!  Love love love him!  His staff was gracious, the nurses were beyond helpful and compassionate!  I am so happy that I chose him to do my surgery!  You know right when you meet him that he is a great person in and out!  My husband loved him and he was there for me day and night and the staff is always available and ready to answer any question any time of day!!  Great experience and a great Doctor make for an overall great result!! :)  Thanks so much Dr. Novia for being your best and not just going through the motions!!  You are fabulous! "
2098,39318,1.0,"Dr. Novia is amazing, my procedure turned out better than I could have imagined.. My breast are BEATIFUL... I LOVE THEM AND SO DOES MY HUSBAND. "
2099,39318,1.0,"I was fortunate enough to have Dr Novia as my Plastic surgeon after being diagnosed with breast cancer. He did an excellent job and was extremely, knowledgeable confident and caring "
2100,39319,1.0,"I have Been seeing Dr. Ng since 1994. I have transferred to other doctors who were closer to my home. I always went back to Dr. NG as i wasn't as satisfied with the other doctors. I have had billing problems with Northgate medical in the past, however they seem to have solved those issues.  "
2101,39319,1.0,has been a very Dr.  that I trust for many year and my family really like him 
2102,39319,1.0,"I have had such limited Service with Dr. NG  My husband was the one that pointed out I need to change doctors. I decided to change to a new doctor within the same clinic Dr. Robyn Madsen and she was so great. Unfortunately she is retired. Be careful when they start you with someone new with less experience. I was a patient of doctor NG's but he rarely seemed to offer good solutions. Sometimes you just get used to the person you're going to and you don't think to make a change. The last straw was in trying to get help for menopausal symptoms (birth control) and he flat out wouldn't perscribe. He asked if I had blood work and I told him I had from a different doctor(not good enough he said!)I remember when I waited 20 minutes for Dr. NG, after that he poked his head in and walked out because I was on my cell. He made me wait another 20 minutes! He later told me if someone is on the phone he moves to the next patient. Well how about a warning first&#63; "
2103,39320,1.0,Dr. Njuguna always is expedient in getting the best treatment available and explaining everything thoroughly threw out the battle of fighting cancer.  
2104,39320,1.0,Very knowledgeable - explained everything simply and expertly! Felt that he wanted us to understand everything clearly and we did not feel rushed.  
2105,39321,2.0,. Very caring and accesable 
2106,39323,0.0,Takes time to understand your health concerns. Goes the extra mile. Knows her stuff. Easy to relate to and to talk with.  Wouldn't go to anyone else 
2107,39323,0.0,I saw this doctor for a little over a year.  she had me on several different meds and decided she didnt want to see me any longer 
2108,39324,1.0,"Dr. Neighbor delivered both of my children. He and his staff are wonderful, warm, professional, and made both birthing experiences terrific.  He actually sat in a corner of my room and dozed while he waited for my birth to progress.  He also has a terrific sense of humor and quick wit so enjoy his quiet nature but don't miss out on that fun side of him! I'd highly recommend Dr. Neighbor.  "
2109,39324,1.0,"dr. neighbor is a wonderful, soft spoken, man an i'm excited to have him deliver my 2nd son. he seems very knowledgable, and patient and i have enjoyed having him for my dr.  "
2110,39324,1.0,Dr Neighbor delivered all 3 of my children.  He also helped me through 2 miscarriages.  He let me have my births my way.  He is just awesome.  He is a soft spoken...mild mannered Man.  I trust his knowledge and expertise.  His staff is the best too :) 
2111,39324,1.0,This Doctor is great he has been around for a long time.Dr. Neighbor and is staff is understaning & caring.This is a great Doctor you can trust.  
2112,39325,1.0,Dr Ng is very knowledgable send time with his patients and answers questions in a professional manner 
2113,39326,1.0,"Russ has good hands.  He tries to keep your teeth conservatively, but he is knowledgeable and aware of all the newest techniques and tools. "
2114,39327,1.0,"hes amazing!He made me feel at ease.  I am new to the area and found him online, i recomend him "
2115,39327,1.0,"Very understanding, never scolded me.  looking forward to seeing him for my third pregnancy! "
2116,39327,1.0,"Dr. Nicolov is a great doctor, but the Everett Clinic communication was frustrating. The entire pregnancy I was under the impression that Dr. Nicolov was going to be there for the birth, on the day of the birth I found out this was not the case and we got an on call doctor I had never met before. The nurses also said that I could schedule for Dr. Nicolov to do my son's circumcision done outpt since he was not available for more that a few mins. the day after the birth. This turned out to not be the case and we had to scramble to fine a urologist that would do it. Overall I felt very confident in the knowledge of this doctor, but he wasn't around when it really counted; during/ after the birth.  "
2117,39327,1.0,Dr Nicolov is wonderful.  I have been seeing him for the last 7 years.  I have a medical condition that is fairly common but causes me issues every now and then.  He always remembers who I am and what issues I have going on so that I don't have to review my whole life with him to discuss something simple.  When I had my son 6 years ago I had a bit of a tough time near the end and knowing that I was in his care was a big deal for me.  Although my c-section was unplanned he was there to perform the surgery and the second he was there I was instantly sure everything was going to be okay. For ob/gyn care I won't see anyone else but him.  He is a fabulous doctor.  
2118,39327,1.0,A great doctor for your first pregnancy!  He is really patient and he never makes you feel rushed to get out of the room.  He'll stay with you and answer all of your questions.  I refer him to all of my friends.  
2119,39328,0.0,"I would strongly recommend against using this doctor.  She eventually correctly diagnosed me with Graves Disease, but mistreated me.  My thyroid was 4 times higher than it should have been and I felt horrible, and just wanted to get better.  She gave me no options but I 131 (radioactive Iodine) when my Thyroid levels were extemely high.  This was a huge mistake, because I got very sick and almost went into a Thyroid storm.  I found out later from a different Endocrinologist that you ALWAYS lower the Thyroid level before giving I 131 because I 131 will make your Thyroid level go up anyway.  I feel like this Doctor almost killed me.  I should have known better when the nurse in the nuclear imaging Dept. who gave me my I 131 tried to tell me ,without telling me to wait to get the medication.  She even printed off a bunch of pages on Graves Disease for me because she knew I would get sick.  I found out later from 2 different Dr's that she is know as &quot;Scary Mary&quot;.  "
2120,39328,0.0,I found Dr. Newman very knowledgable and helpful in attaining a perspective on my present haealth.  She is diligent in narrowing down the problems via bloodwork and exams.  I would and have recommended her to others.  
2121,39328,0.0,"I would caution against using this Doc!  She has scared a number of her patients, including myself.  She is great at reading bloodwork, but when I had a problem, she didn't even order the right bloodwork!  Thank goodness I have another group of docs caring for me at the same time!  Her office staff can be frustrating, and the wait to see her is ridiculous. I strongly suggest finding someone else. "
2122,39329,2.0, 
2123,39330,0.0,"Dr. Newman is kind, patient, and very knowledgeable! She was very willing to talk me through everything she was doing, and always made sure I was prepared.  "
2124,39331,1.0,"8/3/11:I saw Nishimoto for an ankle injury from 10 years ago that’s been getting worse w/time. 10 yrs ago a diff. doc said it was just a bad sprain! Nishimoto told me it had actually broke&now; I’m experiencing arthritis. Nishimoto was very thorough when he explained the issue.  He gave me tips&tricks; to help w/the pain. I will follow his guidelines&visit; him again in 3 weeks. Neither him nor his staff were pushy for me to buy any of the ankle products they showed me. They told me to look for similar ones online. It was comforting they truly care about your finances too! His office is out of network for my ins., but if I do have surgery or anything that will be a financial hit, Nishimoto told me he knows some excellent podiatrists that are in-network for me.  He was very clear that he'd be happy to perform any necessary surgeries, but he wants me to know that if I choose to go in-network he will definitely help me make the right choice as far as surgeons go! I highly recommend Nishimoto! "
2125,39332,0.0,"Great visit, Dr Mai took alot of time to ensure my prescription was perfect.  I arrived early and she was able to take me right away.  Will definitely be back next time I need glasses! "
2126,39333,1.0,Good bedside manner. Dr. Novey is compassionate and knowledgeable and I feel comfortable with him.  
2127,39333,1.0,Very helpful especially with me not having any insurance.  Lots of advice. 
2128,39334,1.0,He is the best pediatrician that we have been with. He is caring and also was voted one of Seattle's Top Doctors by Seattle Magazine in 2009. Any concerns that we have he listens and follows up. He doesn't rush us at all. Most of the staff is nice but his male medical assistant can be in a rush sometimes. 
2129,39335,1.0,". Dr Norling is great, he is busy but helped me with both knees and I am back for a third visit due to another injury "
2130,39335,1.0,"This Doctor does not know what he is talking about. His report has information that has nothing to do with me. He is mixing up his patients information. He said I have high blood pressure when I never had it my whole life. There are plenty other doctors, avoid this one.  "
2131,39336,1.0,"I went to a number of doctors and neurologists to help with my neck and back pain.  Traction and narcotics made my life hell for over 18 months. Dr. Naini immediately found the problem, and after the surgery I feel great!  A night and day difference.  Dr. Naini saved my life, and I enjoyed every moment with him. "
2132,39336,1.0,"This man did what he described as his 'extensive' films on my spine, which was suspecting to be the cause of the stabbing pain from my neck and all the way down my back. However, after reviewing his detailed and 'extensive' films, Dr. Naini could not find anything wrong with me. So I suffered in pain for another 15 months until Dr. Cole at NW Spine and Sports ordered a simple MRI which clearly showed that my spine had been compressed on 3 different levels. To this day, I still do not know the cause for this and now, its been 8 years since this journey began and I've had 3 surgeries so far, with a 4th scheduled for next month. Yet, I will never forget that it was Dr. Naini whom I sat across from, that sat across from me and told me there was 'absolutely nothing of significance' that he could find to justify the symptoms that I was describing. REALLY&#63;&#63;&#63;&#63;&#63;  Hmmm.... and although I am glad that he has brought so much relief to so many others,,, I was not meant to be one of them. "
2133,39336,1.0,"Dr Naini is the most conscientious Dr. I know, and after two hip surgerys, open heart surgery and general care he's the best.  I had a pituary adenoma (brain tumor) which  he carefully excised during a 12 surgery. It was a tricky operation because I had a fibrous tumor, (difficult to remove)   After the operation I felt so good that I wrongfully over exerted myself, causing the transsphenoidal surgery to lead spinal fluid.   Dr Naini, personnaly met me in the ER to assess my condition.  He promptly attended to me every morning, until I was ready to go.  Contrary to the negative review above, my experince with the nurses at Evergreen confirmed that he is the most conscientious and attentive Dr they know.  Returns all calls promptly and explains the condition thoroughly.  He's a 5+ out of 5.  "
2134,39336,1.0,dr naini is #1 in my book he treated me like an indavidual not a # and did wonders on my neck surgery.He is a wonderful man and I'm so glad he was the one who performed my last surgery on my neck.I am pain free and amazed at the way he would return my calls if I needed him.Most Dr.dont speak to their patients personally you always speak to their assistance cuz they have no time for you.Not him HE CARES and that is very unusual.HANDS DOWN!! He is the BEST!!  and I've seen many.Thank you Dr Naini Men like you are hard to find.You should be proud!!!!! 
2135,39336,1.0,"DOCTOR NAINI IS ONE OF THE FINEST NEUROSURGEONS THAT I HAVE PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE OF. I WAS IN SO MUCH PAIN WITHIN MY LOWER BACK. HE REVIEWED MY CASE GAVE ME DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS TO FOLLOW.(A HANDOUT THAT HE HAD WRITTEN HIMSELF FOR HIS PATIENTS TO FOLLOW.)HE SPENT AN EXTENDED AMOUNT OF TIME ASKING QUESTIONS REGARDING MY CONDITION AND ABOUT A PREVIOUS OPERATION IN THE SAME AREA.HE SPENT 5 HOURS REPAIRING MY L2,L3,L4AND L5 DISKS.HE CALLED ON ME SEVERAL TIMES A DAY TO  CHANGE MY DRESSINGS. HE CARES ABOUT HIS PATIENTS AND DEVOTES AS MUCH TIME AS REQUIRED TO SEE THAT YOU ARE COMFORTABLE AND FOLLOWING HIS INSTRUCTIONS. I AM FREE OF PAIN FOR THE FIRST TIME IN YEARS AND WISH I HAD FOUND HIM EARLIER. HE IS TRUELY A CREDIT TO HIS PROFESSION .  "
2136,39336,1.0,"Dr. Naini was kind, compassionate and respectful.  After shopping around for the best doctor I'm very satisfied with my decision "
2137,39336,1.0,Dr. Naini is extremely professional. He makes everything clear and understandable. He is caring and competent. A+ 
2138,39336,1.0,This guy is top notch all the way.  He is somewhat droll in his bedside manner but he's a neurosurgeon so you must expect this.  He is extremely caring and was very patient and available after hours when a call was made about an issue.  The only complaint that I have is that his office staff were not the most pleasant people to deal with.  The billing person took literally WEEKS to return a call.  
2139,39336,1.0,Expectional care and concern. Took time before and after surgery with both patient and family. Gave very complete written instruction of how to prepare and follow-up with surgery. 
2140,39337,2.0,"Very good doctor,caring and has lots of empathy to all patients. "
2141,39338,0.0,"Dr. Neary is the nicest, most patient, doctor I have ever had.  She's very knowledgeable and smart.  She also will explain it to you in doctor terms as well as layman's terms. I live in Federal Way and refuse to switch doctors.  "
2142,39339,1.0,"Did an emergency colonoscopy in the hospital.He and his staff were friendly,helpful,caring &amp; informative.Went back for bi-yearly exam as did my husband.We couldn't be more pleased with Dr.Nader and staff.  "
2143,39339,1.0,Dr. nader cured my  hep. c he ans his staff were wonderful! i'm 10 yr's clean and alive. 
2144,39339,1.0,saw him for 3 minutes and was rushed out of the door. 
2145,39340,1.0,He has done 2 successful surgeries on my feet to treat plantar fascitis. I was amazed with the results! I've recommended him to neighbors and they have been very pleased.  
2146,39340,1.0,". Great, knowlegable, flexible regarding treatment options "
2147,39340,1.0,Got me in on short notice.  Was helpful and knowledgeable. 
2148,39340,1.0,Dr Nellermoe done surgery on my foot and I couldn't be happier with the results. He is the best and I would recommend him to anybody. 
2149,39340,1.0,My first experience with Dr. Nellermoe was in 2010. At that time I had an infection and two ingrown nails which he removed painlessly.  
2150,39341,0.0,"While waiting in the waiting room I over heard one of the staff members say she was going to check the obituaries to see who they could cross off their list this week then joked about it. Waited over an hour past my appt. to be put into a room. Then another half hour in the room when I was the only patient in the building. Dr Nguyen was more interested in my proffession than why I was there. He hadn't even looked at my chart prior to my appt. He then told me my case wasn't interesting enough for him to take any more time with me, yet he took the time to tell me that my job was a waste of time and he shouldn't have to pay taxes to support local gov't. He reffered me to the Seattle clinic yet forgot to process the request so I had to call a week later to see why Seattle hadn't called me yet. His nurse said he must have been too busy that day.  Very poor service and would not recommend him to anyone! "
2151,39342,2.0,very helpful. Good chairside manner.Dr.  Nelson goes above and beyond to make you comfortable 
2152,39343,1.0,"He is the best eye Dr. I have been to, very compassionate and informative!  Great staff as well, I will be taking my whole family here from now on.   :) "
2153,39343,1.0,"I drive from Mercer Island to see Dr. Neal, after starting off with him when he used to be in Fairwood before moving to Maple Valley.  He is among the best optometrists I've had.  Visits are always smooth.  He has put me into great contacts, and solved some initial presbyopia issues for me by backing of my prescription. "
2154,39343,1.0,I never feel rushed through my appointments. He takes the time to listen and explain. He has taken time out of his day to call me so I didn't have to come into the office. 
2155,39344,1.0,"I'd lived with a less than ideal rhinoplasty for more than 10 years. After moving and beginning a new life I was ready to have it revised and went to Dr. Naficy based on his reputation. My main concern was tip assymetry with nasal bossae which is a fairly common complication with primary rhinoplasty. After spending all that time and all that money the nasal bossae remains and is barely improved at all; what a complete waste. I ended up having to have a third revision (I flew to NYC) to correct the problem. Furthermore, I wasn't impressed with the level of care and concern by Dr. Naficy and his office. Although I live about 10 minutes from his office, nobody EVER followed through, they honestly didn't seem to care how it turned out in the end once they had the money. Bottom line, if you need a problem solved and are looking for someone with the skills necessary as well as a little bit of caring, LOOK ELSEWHEE; Naficy is a big waste of time and money. "
2156,39344,1.0,"I never got to see Dr. Nacify because of the women in charge of sceduling consultations:namely Julie Legman. Her and I had been emailing each other trying to get a sceduled time, she was being very accomidating at first. Then one day I called her because she didn't email me back with the final confirmation and another woman took my info, then she said,&quot;It seems like you've been dealing with Julie Legman, let me put you on hold....&quot; Well no one every came back! I called the next day to give them one more chance and they had booked my tenative appointment with someone else! I was shocked. Three things:1.not emailing me back.2.Making me hold till I had no choice but to hang up and 3.booking an appointment time that I had for someone else. I don't know why they were so unproffessional, but it sort of hurt my feelings! Anyway, bad bad front office! "
2157,39344,1.0,Dr. Nacify is a wonderful caring doctor. I had a facelift done by him a year ago and I am thrilled with the results. 
2158,39344,1.0,I managed a plastic surgery office for many years.  When my Dr. closed I had to find a new place to keep up my appearance.  I went to see Dr. Nacify convinced I needed a facelift.  He said I just needed a fat grafting to my face instead to restore a more youthful appearance.  He counseled me to avoid the ‘windswept’ look you see in Hollywood.   I love the outcome; the grooves in my cheeks are gone.  I get botox shots from Sharon.    I am a ‘bleeder’ and she has never left a bruise on my face.  Amazing.  And I love their reward program.  I would recommend Dr. Nacify and his team to anyone. 
2159,39344,1.0,Dr. Naficy and his staf were EXTREMELY knowledgable and courteous. They are all wonderful at making you feel very comfortable and at ease.  You can't get any better! 
2160,39344,1.0,"I highly recommend Dr. Naficy.  3 of my family members including myself have gone to him for a variety of surgery issues that were facial related. His abilities and professionalism make him top of the class. His office staff ensures the procedure is understood, is caring and follows up even for small items like a restalyne shot.  Highly recommended to everyone needing a top notch surgeon. "
2161,39344,1.0,Excellent staff! Great before and after pictures on internet. 
2162,39344,1.0,"Wow, what a wonderful surgeon.It was found that I had a skin cancer in my face and Dr. Naficy was to operate. I was very nervous and could feel my blood pressure rising. I was prepped for the surgery and the numming injection caused my heart to palpatate. When Dr. Naficy came in to start the proceedure, he noticed that I was whiter than usual and in distress. Right away he raised me up so I could sit up and put a fan on me and turned on music. The coolest thing was that he started singing along with the radio to calm me down and distract me. I was ready to run out the door but after a few minutes, we proceeded with the proceedure and I am cancer free. What a great human being and surgeon. "
2163,39344,1.0,This is a wonderful doctor who I whole heartily trust with my face. He does not offer what you don't need and he truly cares. He has done great things for my face and did and does not give me unrealistic expectations. He also has a wonderful staff who I've come to know. I've never cared about any doctor I've ever had in the past until Sam Naficy. I believe he is at the top of his field. 
2164,39345,1.0,He is a great doctor. Very helpful and he works fast.  
2165,39346,1.0,Dr. Nudelman is GREAT!  He has such a calming affect on high strung pregnant ladies!  :)  You cannot help but calm down when you are in his presence.  :) And the staff at Bellegrove has always been efficient and helpful.  I would highly recommend both Dr. Nudelman AND Bellegrove OB/GYN. 
2166,39346,1.0,"Dr. Nudelman is excellent.  We came to him after a horrible obgyn when we were pregnant with our son.  He was very knowledgable, honest, and funny!  Really makes you feel at ease and is excellent at including the father in the process.  I am convinced that anybody who dislikes him wants an answer for everything even if there isnt one and the dr has to make it up.  He will tell you how it is and won't pretend he knows things he does not (for example any dr that says they can tell you will go early or late is taking a wild guess...baby decides when to arrive!) I was able to have a natural delivery even though I was in labor for over 30 hrs with very slow progress.  He didn't push it.  He gave me my options and let me do it my way.  Love love love him! :). Also his staff is incredible!!!  I had some trouble healing after giving birth and was in his office about every 2weeks.  The nurses would always beg to take my son to play with him.   He loved them! And so did I! :) "
2167,39346,1.0,"I started to see Dr. Nudleman in 1995 when I was having a specific issue that my own gyno could not diagnose. Long story short, he diagnosed my problem and even went to the extrreme of calling my husband during the  weekend to make sure I was feeling OK and was comfortable. I have been seeing him as my regular gyno ever since. I have had 2 children and have since been through an ablation. He is a wonderful doctor who really knows what he talking about! He takes the extra time and actually cares about his patients. I give him a wonderful recommendation.  "
2168,39346,1.0,"He was ok during my pregnancy. In December 2009, I had the Mirena IUD put in. I liked it at first but eventually I started experiencing side effects including hair loss, ovarian cysts, acne, back pain, weight gain, nausea &amp; headaches.  Once the ovarian cysts started giving me a lot of pain &amp; discomfort, I made the decision to have the IUD removed. It should have been a 15 minute appointment; it was an hour &amp; fifteen minutes of him trying to talk me out of it.  I had thought long &amp; hard about having the IUD removed &amp; I was very sure of my decision.  This is my body &amp; I have the right to choose what I want, ESPECIALLY when it is causing health problems. I did make it clear that the IUD would be coming out and that was that and so FINALLY, he removed it. I was in tears leaving the place.  If you’re looking for someone who wants what is best for you and your body, and who is compassionate and caring and a good listener, then this is not the OBGYN for you.  "
2169,39346,1.0,"Dr. Nudelman has been my dr for 6 years and has always exceeded my expectations.  He delivered my 3rd child via C-section and I was very nervous before my surgery, but he made me feel like I was in excellent hands even though my pregnancy was high risk.  Dr. Nudelman always listens to my concerns as a patient and provides honest feedback, recommendations and referrals.  I have never felt rushed during my appointments and I really appreciate the time he takes to answer all of my questions.  He is conscientious and checks out any medical concerns in a thorough manner.  My last OB/GYN was at the Polyclinic and I was shocked when one of her staff told me she had a full 10 minutes allocated for my appointment.  Sometimes appointments with Dr. Nudelman get started a little late, but I never feel rushed out the door so I am more than willing to accept that in light of great medical care.  "
2170,39346,1.0,"I have had a great experience with Dr. Nudelman over the past 7 years. After a friend recommended him, I switched to his care during a difficult early pregnancy. He took a lot of time with me and gave me the facts that I craved and was missing from my previous OBGYN. I eventually miscarried, but Nudelman delivered my healthy twin girls via a C-Section a couple of years later and worked with our perinatologist very early which I think helped me make it to 37 wks for two 7+lbs babies. He was very good at taking extra time with me when I needed it, so I am willing to weather the occasional wait-time at his office. I find him very understanding in emotional situations and willing to go the extra mile for his patients.  "
2171,39346,1.0,"HORRIBLE!!!  Obvious lack of knowledge beyond basic procedures and complete disregard for patient well being.  Was unable to help for my specific situation and didn't even recommend other alternative doctors who would be able to assist.  His hands were shaking during the appointment which was very concerning especially if this was the case during an operation.  Simple procedures, he might be fine but push him beyond the basics and he has a complete personality shift almost as if he has no idea where to begin or what to do - basically gave up!  Would not recommend to anyone! "
2172,39346,1.0,"I was referred to Dr. Nudelman by radiologist Dr. Pierre-Jermome from Overlake due to an urgent bleeding uterine fibroid I've been dealing with for several months.Dr. Nudelman demonstrated no empathy, care of concern for the fact I have been taking 3-4 birth control pills/day to control bleeding; I have been bleeding non-stop for 6 months and have heavy clotting/flooding that wakes me in the middle of the night and forces me to stay on the toilet for hours on end to relieve the clotting/bleeding. He did not know how to view or read the MRI images sent over by the radiologist and took no action to locate the 3 previous Ultrasounds I've had over the past 6 mos to use as a benchmark to determine an appropirat course of action. Unfortunately he showed no concern or interest in helping me out with my urgent situation.All he offered was quit my job, get some sleep, stop the birth control, allow the extensive bleeding to happen &amp; work with a dr. on a long term plan. I'm at a loss for help. "
2173,39346,1.0,"Dr. Nudelman is the best doctor ever, he is very helpful and has very good knowlege and he listen. "
2174,39346,1.0,"Dr Nudelman is the best doctor i ever had, i never had any problem after my pregnancy. he came and visit me on his day off. he is very caring very kind and he always listen to his patient. "
2175,39346,1.0,A very intelligent doctor who went above and beyond.  He sometimes runs late but when I had some difficulties with a miscarriage and two very difficult pregnancies he spent extra time with me and squeezed me in between appointments in times that I needed to see him so I didn't mind waiting extra to see him. He even called me immediately back on a holiday evening when I was having trouble with my pregnancy.  He delivered both of my children and would recommend him to anyone.  
2176,39346,1.0,"Dr Nudelman is an excellent Doctor. He is very patient,knowledgable, listens carefully and spends time with patients.There is no feeling of hurrying up the appointment. He lets you exhaust all your questions and answers them patiently. He prefers doing most examinations and tests himself which isn't the case with most good doctors. I highly recommend Dr Nudelman.  "
2177,39346,1.0,"Dr. Nudelman is the best Physician I have ever had. I was refered to him by my sister when I was tired having my Anuuals done by a Nurse Practician at a different Dr.'s office. On the 1st visit alone, he found a cyst on my ovary. He monitored it every month and after observing that it was growing significantly, he made the decision to suggest operating. I was only 22 at the time so I was terrified and hesitant about having my ovary operated on. He practically held my hand through the entire process. Took extra time to explain everything to me until I was comfortable enough. He even called me once to answer more questions and I could tell he was driving home...it was around 7:30...PM. He goes beyond and is very knowledgeable. When I expressed I was fearful of the possibility of losing 1 of my ovaries, he reassured me that he would do everything he could to save it, that he would treat me as if it were his own daughter's operation. My ovary is fine now. His nurse is also very kind.  "
2178,39346,1.0,Dr. nudelman delivered my 1st child in 2005 and the expierence that i had with him was the best ever. To this day i still go to his clinic to have my yearly exams just so i can see him he's the best.   Wynter Guzman 
2179,39346,1.0,Dr. Nudelman delivered our daughter by c-section in January 2008.  I was very scared but he took the time to discuss procedure and putting me at ease.    When I was feeling very blue and worn out after the delivery of our daughter he helped me even more and recommended solutions to the problems.  He is a great doctor. 
2180,39346,1.0,I had a c-section with my son in 2005.Dr.Nudleman did a great job.He is a very nice person and a very good doc.He really cares.If you want a good OBY/Gyn than go to him!You can really trust him.  
2181,39346,1.0,"Nudelman is a super OBGYN. I recently gave birth to my first child and my husband and I were very impressed with his care and passion for what he does. ONe of the things that impressed us was the high percentage of his own patients babies he delivers (the highest in the practice). And yes he did deliver our baby on a night when he wasn't even on-call. Both my husband and I both really appreciated the comfort of having our own doctor dilever our baby. He also followed up the next day checking to see how my recovery was going, performed our baby boys circumcision and was just a true professional throughout the process. "
2182,39346,1.0,"Super doctor.He really cares about his patients.The best OB-GYN,I ever had.***** "
2183,39347,2.0,"Not an MD, but still absolutely amazing. "
2184,39348,0.0,Dr. Nopachai and her staff are very good.  I would recommend joining her if you are looking for a Pediatric Dr.  
2185,39349,1.0,The best doctor I have had yet. He was really thorough and also had compassion and understanding. He has lots of experience. He was only filling in for another doctor in our state- I wish he was a permanent fixture here. We need more like him.  
2186,39350,2.0,. excellent doctor very nice help treated my feet pains 
2187,39351,1.0,"Dr. Nelson came highly recommended by a friend of mine who is an anesthesiologist.  I have suffered with recurring kidney stones for over 30 years.  Dr. Nelson was very thorough, caring and a good listener.  He suggested several tests that none of my previous urologists have mentioned.  He seemed concerned about resolving my stone problems, rather than just simply treating them.  I would give very high marks....10 out of 10, and would recommend him without hesitation.  "
2188,39351,1.0,Arrogant and rude.  Does not want to listen to patient's concerns.  Has an attitude.  Does not seem to be concerned with patient's discomfort during examinations.  Won't seek treatment from this Doctor again. 
2189,39352,1.0,Dr. Nibler is NOT a good physician. He spends very little time with patients and is very COCKY with a bad attitude.  He acts as if he knows everything and is very incompentent! 
2190,39353,1.0,"When my long time Dr. retired last year, Dr. Quoc Anh Nguyen of Olympia Family and Internal Medicine became my family practitioner. I have found Dr. Nguyen to be the most accessable, caring, and hard-working Dr. I have had the pleasure to know. Recently, my insurance company denied a procedure that both Dr. Nguyen and I thought would be the next rational course for us to take. Let me tell you, Dr. Nguyen fought tooth and nail with my insurance company for them to approve the procedure. He was on the phone for hours fighting for me. There's nothing more important in life than your health. And the fact that there are amazing human beings, in this case my Dr., Dr. Nguyen who put in the time and effort to fight for their fellow brothers and sisters; well there's nothing more comendable, honorable, or touching than that...P.S. I do not like reviews or surveys but felt compelled to do this one. Dr. Nguyen is that good!!! Thank you so much Dr. "
2191,39353,1.0,"Dr. Nguyen is what's wrong with medicine. I told him i was depressed and wanted counseling, and he instantly prescribed me, a healthy 20 year old, paxil with no suggestion of therapy. I came back six weeks later to tell him i hadnt been taking it, and thought therapy would be more useful, and he once again pushed for the paxil. He at one point offered to give me a list of counselers, but didn't actually do it. He also seemed to be almost happy that I was smoking pot.  "
2192,39354,1.0,"All I can say, is his entire office, staff runs like a well oiled machine! He is professional, knowledgable, curtious, punctual, thorough, and a good listener. His staff is equally efficient and knowlegable in their perspective positions. When I have called with a question, I am connected immediately to whom I need to speak to. They in-turn, promptly talk with  Dr. and call me back the same day, as a rule, long distance, to reply. Everyone from the ladies that greet you at the reception desk to Dr. Nakashima, himself makes his patients feel as though they came to work that day, specifically, because &quot;you&quot; had an appointment! I reccomend him to anyone that I feel could benefit from his knowledge and expertise. I have ALWAYS left his office feeling just a little bit better about things.  In today's world, that's really special "
2193,39355,1.0,Thanks for the warm service from Dr M.  Nguyen! I had my right eye vision completely blurred and followed his instruction to have a successful surgery last year! 
2194,39355,1.0,"I had a serious case of Uveitis / Eiritis back in 2002. Dr. Nguyen diagnosed and managed my recovery very well. I especially appreciated the clear way he communicated information about my condition and progress. In his style, he comes across very professional, wears a suit, and yet he can quickly form a personal bond with his patients.  "
2195,39355,1.0,Dr. Nguyen is a fantastic doctor who has treated me for diabetic retinopothy.  He came highly recommended by a doctor I saw at Johns-Hopkins in Baltimore.  He has operated on my eyes several times with no pain.  I cannot recommend him highly enough.  
2196,39355,1.0,". Does not care about your time, scared my daughter "
2197,39355,1.0,Dr Nguyen is a fabulous doctor. He has an abundance of knowledge in retina. He treats my whole family and we all see well. The proccedures are quick and work well. My uncle sees much better than ever before. I would tell all friends and aquaintances about TT Nguyen. The office staff is abundace of help in getting a timely appointlment.  
2198,39355,1.0,"ok doctor, Vietnamese staff unknowledgeable "
2199,39355,1.0,"Dr. Nguyen’s Argon Laser procedure was inappropriate.  My problem was a hemorrhage into the vitreous.  The blood in my eye made it impossible to effectively treat with the Argon Laser.  No one could have seen through the blood in my left eye.  Dr. Nguyen's treatment was in gross error.  If you care about your eyes, don't consider Dr. Nguyen as a credible professional, find someone who cares and has a track record of excellence or at the very least get a second opinion. "
2200,39355,1.0,"Dr. Nguyen (pronounced &quot;Win&quot;) is a great doctor. Yes, he makes you wait a long time, but that's because the group he works with schedules too many people and he is a GREAT doc who takes all the time needed to answer questions and reassure you. He is VERY FAST as a surgeon and I think he is the best surgeon in the Universe. He is a retina specialist, but he also does cataract surgery. He is very caring and has never had a bad outcome because he is very skilled and careful. He is excellent. You will be very happy to entrust your eyesight to him.  "
2201,39356,1.0,"I think he is very good.  He certainly knows his stuff and really cares about his patients and wants to do the best for them, including helping them to quit smoking! "
2202,39356,1.0,"Naibert told me if I didn't quit smoking he wasn't going to write me another prescription for my pain control.  Also on one visit he ask if I needed something to help with my constipation, then on next visit he told me just to eat more vegis, there wasn't anything he could do to help relieve my constipation, which is it Naibert&#63; "
2203,39356,1.0,Dr naibert should have a detox program available when he decides to pull your meds because your tired of his controlling ways. I was ridiculed at every visit for smoking. Something I have done for 38 years. Nobody wants to give them up more than I. He told me if I did not quit he would pull my meds and he did. 400 mg's of morphine a day and 6 #10 percocet. Then i had to stop cold turkey at home. I wouldn't wish this on nobody. Did dr naibert care Hell no. he was no longer getting his kick back from selling his poisons. Very unprofessional. This has nothing to do with your piss test Naibert. 
2204,39357,2.0, 
2205,39358,1.0,My family has been seing Dr Nguyen for the past 5 yr. He has provided our family with   the very best care.  He is very busy and it can be hard to make appointment but his care for our family has been the best.  
2206,39358,1.0,"Excellent communication skills, explains issues in words I understand.  "
2207,39358,1.0,"I recommend Dr. Nguyen.  He is the family doctor for my husband and my son, and previously for my foster kids.  He is knowledgeable and caring.  He especially has a great manner with kids, really putting them at ease, and adapting his style to the age of the child.  We have a lot of confidence in him.  "
2208,39358,1.0,"Dr. Nguyen is very personable. He does speak very fast and it can make you feel like you're being a bit rushed. But he's very nice and has been extremely helpful to me. I've had 5 office visits with him. His nursing staff are very nice, but the reception area not so much. He's usually running behind which can be an inconvenience. When i mentioned this to him he said &quot;I know we are, but once you get in here don't we treat you good&#63;&quot;. Which really was true so i had to agree. "
2209,39359,1.0,"Dr Norquist was rude, didn't answer any of my questions and made me feel stupid for asking them.  I have talked about a sympton for months and when I address it he tells me it is not part of my injury.  I offically started calling other clinics so I never have to go to NWOS again.  No one on their staff is helpful or nice. "
2210,39359,1.0,"I had the worst experience,Dr Norquist was rude and had a bad bed side manner. He doesn't care about this patients. All they see is how fast they can get you out of their facility! They just try to get you out as fast as they. I guess the bottom line is that, they try to save some $$$. It's next to impossible to get an appointment, if you do.. I called the pratice Northwest Orthopaedic Specialists for over a week before anyone would even call me back for appt,They were so unorganized!!The doctors throw a prescription at you without giving you a thorough examination. The nurses treat everyone like we have no right to ask any questions!!! I have heard from many people about their negative experiences with the pratice Northwest Orthopaedic Specialists!!! Beware!! "
2211,39360,1.0,Dr Nalin and his staff are wonderful.  I love going to see him.  He has introduced me to the water pick and I love the way it makes my teeth feel.

Dr Nalin is very knowledgeable and explains everything in detail of what is to be done. My daughter started out with getting an expander there and is now on her full mouth of braces and her teeth are looking amazing! We are both very pleased with the results so far - we definitely give Dr Nalin and his staff an A+!! "
2217,39360,1.0,"This office is friendly, knowledgeable and professional! Everyone is pleasant and the atmosphere is comfortable. I am so impressed at how well my smile has transformed since I began treatment, and could not be more happy with the customer service.

2224,39361,1.0,". Been going here for 8 years for wisdom tooth removal, and regular check ups "
2225,39361,1.0,"While the staff were very nice and helpful, and got me pulled back to a room as soon as possible, Dr. Nguyen himself was ... not.  He dismissed my concern about an exposed root, made fun of me when I said I hadn't seen a cavity on one of my upper teeth, and said I needed to wait a month to see if my pain would resolve.  All in all, not a very good experience.  Would not recommend him to others.  "
2226,39362,0.0,Dr. Nelson has been my Dr. for several years now and I have followed her to 3 different offices.  She always takes the time to answer all my questions and never makes me feel rushed.  She is very knowledeable and makes me feel very comfortable.  I will follow her anywhere.  
2227,39362,0.0,"is horrible about returning calls, and refilling or providing ANY prescriptions.  shes very nice in person but otherwise very unhelpful "

2229,39364,1.0,". would not look at me, he stared at the floor throughout my entire appointment "
2230,39364,1.0,Very personable. Takes the time to ask health questions you don't normally think about. Would definitely recommend to family and friends.  
2231,39365,2.0,A Great Doctor. I wish other doctors were as good. 
2232,39366,1.0,"I had a terrible time with my hormones and got no help from an Ob/Gyn or a nurse practitioner, but Dr. Nordeen listened to me, told me what to expect, and when it did not resolve, he saw me quickly, and he figured out my problem.  What a relief.  He's very kind, listens, and understands women's issues, unlike so many doctors.  My experience with him has been very good and he has helped me more than anyone regarding my health problem.  He's very comfortable and unintimidating.  Nice man.  He's very punctual, too, yet spends plenty of time. "
2233,39367,0.0,"Never had to wait more than 5 minutes in waiting room.  Very profesional and explained every option.  Did not push surgery on me, instead gave me all of the information and gave me time to make my own decision.  Had a Lower Lamonectomy Fusion of L5/S1 with Instramentation and it was a success.  My quality of life is ten times better than before the surgery.   KB "
2234,39367,0.0,". Very good with dealling with my elderly mother, he spent a lot of time making sure she understood what her options were for spine surgery "
2235,39368,1.0,"Misdiagnosed my son, lied about findings, caused him great harm. Records reflect his lies yet he refused to correct them or address the situation. Son taken off medication and remained untreated for 3 years because of this awful doctor. "
2236,39368,1.0,"There was significant inconsistency in what was told to my daughter's other treating physician vs. instructions given to us. Treatment protocol seems to differ quite a bit in some areas than what is found at other reputable Epilepsy Centers. The hospital his practice is affiliated with, while being the only Epilepsy Center in CT, is not a Comprehensive Epilepsy Center. "
2237,39368,1.0,"He would tell me one thing, told my doctor a different story. unreachable by phone.  refused to answer questions "
2238,39369,2.0,Made the pain go away quickly. Made appointment that day and got in. 
2239,39370,2.0,Great listener 
2240,39371,0.0,"Be careful if you decide to go here.  It was my first time and I had a condescending hygienist who felt like she was qualified to diagnose me with periodontal disease.  Dr. Nartea was nice but looked at me only briefly, just enough to visually &quot;confirm&quot; the hygienist's observations.  I am in my mid 20's and have gone to the dentist regularly! The hygienist made me feel as if my old dentist wasn't good enough because he never told me that I had periodontal disease and never treated me for it. They wanted to schedule me for an expensive &quot;treatment&quot; to supposedly save my teeth.  I was skeptical and went to my old dentist for a second opinion.  My dentist did not find any signs of the disease and told me there was no need for the treatment they recommended.  In fact, there was a tartar on one tooth, which he was able to remove with a tool.  Needless to say, I will not be back.  I picked this dentist randomly out of the phone book.  I will stick with my regular dentist from now on. "
2241,39371,0.0, 
2242,39371,0.0,Avoid at all costs! Poor dental skills and unprofessional staff.

2247,39373,0.0,"This is definitely the best Dentist I have ever had. His staff is amazing, polite, and warm. And although his receptionist was multi tasking and having to do some many things at one, she still remained cool and collected and helped us out efficiently and effectively. Dr.Nguyen is very personable and funny! His hygenist is very caring and was very gentle. They also make an effort to get to know you.  I felt like I had been going to him for years although it was my first visit! He is an execellent decision in a Dentist! "
2248,39373,0.0,This is the best dentist I have ever had. The entire staff is wonderful. They do a great job of making everyone feel at ease.

2251,39375,2.0,Very intelligent doctor who took the time to get to know me and my problem.  Excellent surgeon 
2252,39376,1.0,"Came in for a mood disorder and mild seizures. Dr. Neppe recommended a 72 hour at home EEG. He told me I have temporal lobe instability. Started me on Lamictal and half a dozen vitamins. They didn't work, so I stopped the Lamictal and decreased the amount of vitamins due to side effects. I asked to start on Trileptal. He insisted on Tegretol. I refused because of some internet research I had done and he reluctantly prescribed me Trileptal. It effectively controlled my mood instability, but not all of my seizures. Every visit thereafter he lectured me for ~15 min saying I would be 100% cured I had listened on the Tegretol and took all my vitamins. I continuously refused based on side effects. At one point he suggested I would never be cured without listening to him. Dr. Neppe dismissed my idea to see another neurologist for a video EEG. That EEG came back saying my seizures were psychogenic. Now taking Lithium and Trileptal. Feel 100% better. Overall: Good, but needs to learn to listen.  "
2253,39376,1.0,"i too am appalled with the first review.i have been seeing dr neppe for ten years now.i have seen other doctors but he was the only one that acted like he wanted to know what was wrong with me.yes alot of the jargon is confusing but if you stop to ask him what it means he is more than willing to explain.whenever i and everyone else i know go to the doctor for anything they spend two seconds with you,diagnose you without taking a test and treat you with something that doesnt work and ends up costing money.dr neppe is the only doctor ive ever been to that gives you every blood test under the sun to see if you have a vitamin deficiency that can be fixed with supplements instead of just throwing anti depressants at you. i would and have recommended him to many people "
2254,39376,1.0,"First I am appalled at what the one other person wrote about Dr Neppe. That person apparentely did not see Dr Neppe enough. Reason being, one is the cost of the report, yes it is a very high price report that is confusing to a patient which is why he recommends your provider reads through it with you. If it is not a provider that is of psychiatry profession it may not make sense to them either. Dr Nepp's Pacific Neuropsycatry Institue, www.pni.org, is amazing. If someone is going to see Dr Neppe they need to be educated on what he does and what to expect. I feel so honored that I was able to be a patient of a nationally known neuropsychiatrist. This man is amazing and all you have to do is go to his website, www.pni.org and read all about him and his work. He does have a book that is great reading but could not be for everyone. He does do a physical. you can only go to him by referral so your dr should know of him and his practices.  I thank Dr Neppe for all he did for me! "
2255,39376,1.0,"I was referred to Dr. Neppe for evaluation of neurological/psychiatric problems due to Lupus.I found it strange that I had to  sign away so many of my rights when I first saw him.  He had me agree to privately pay for his report--$900. This included only 2 copies. Period.  The information Dr Neppe asked for was thorough.I saw him probably 6-8 times. He did not keep my referring physician updated, though.  At the and I asked for an evaluation of his findings.  I got a computer-generated report that made no sense. The reports my two doctors received were also of no use whatsoever.  Dr. Neppe advertised his newest book on a banner behind the reception desk.  He also asked me if I would buy a copy to go along with the evaluation.  In the end, Dr. Neppe was generous in not requiring me to pay much at all for the reports.  He also is the only neurologist or psychiatrist who has ever asked me to disrobe for a physical exam. "
2256,39377,1.0,"Dr. Neuzil was rude and rushed through the ime visit. To get paid for what he did or I should say did not do should be a crime.  If you have to see him for a IME, REFUSE !!! "
2257,39378,0.0,"Dr. Neuger did my breast cancer surgery.  I could not have asked for a more caring, or knowledgable person.  She discussed each step with me and spent the time making sure I understood everything which would be taking place.  If you are feeling apprehensive about your surgery (cancer or otherwise), you could not be more fortunate than to have Dr. Neuger look after you.  "
2258,39378,0.0,"She is the best surgeon in the world.                                                                                                                           -Kind Regards,                          Mr Stephenson. "
2259,39378,0.0,"i do not recommend dr neuger to anyone.  i had a cyst removed b/c it became painful.  after getting it removed i was still feeling the pain and her response to me was that it wasn't b/c of the cyst. i'm not sure why she removed it and told me the pain would be gone.  i went in again for a follow-up visit and showed her another cyst i found.  she told me it was my rib-bone and basically treated me like i was a big waste of her time.  turns out, i actually do have another cyst and its NOT my rib-bone.  she was cold and extremely impersonal.  i don't recommend her to anyone "
2260,39379,1.0,"Dr. Nichols and his staff were all very kind and knowledgeable. Dr. Nichols and the nurse spent over an hour with me, educating me on the procedure I was interested in. I feel confident having surgery by Dr. Nichols and would not go anywhere else. The price is a slightly higher than other places but I believe it is worth it. The office is nice looking and comfortable. "
2261,39380,1.0,"Very helpful Psychiatrist.  Makes you feel at ease quickly, is very understanding and very helpful.  Has a very open mind if you are interested in specific types of treatment(s) as long as they do make sense.  I'll be seeing him again. "
2262,39380,1.0,"He was the best doctor I have ever talked to. Which says a lot for the city of Pullman. Which is known for student death, and horrible healthcare in general. I loved this doc, he knows what he's doing and is great at his job. "
2263,39381,1.0,. excellent doctor he help me with my sprained thumb very kind 
2264,39383,1.0,"Dr. Paul Nghiem is the BEST!!!  I saw him for years and years at the Dana Farber Cancer Center in Boston. I would drive 60 miles each way for my appointments and it was worth it. I have had troubles with skin cancer since 17 years old (Basal cell nevus syndrome)and have seen many many doctors over the years and none are as good as Dr. Nghiem.  Not only is he a top doctor in his field / skin cancer he is a super nice person.  He takes his time with patients and takes time to share his knowledge.  His biopsies are small (non scarring) and he is very good at recommending other removal techniques (e.g., MOHS) when you need it.  I have had at least 50  skin cancers removed over the years (in my 40s now)so I have some experience. The people of Seattle and the State of Washington are very very lucky!!  I only wish he were still here in Boston.  Two thumbs way up for Dr. Nghiem.  "
2265,39384,0.0,"Dr. Nelsen is wonderful.  She has been my primary care doctor for over ten years.  She is knowledgable and kind.  She listens and doesn't have a problem recommending alternative treatments.  We love her Nurse, Tiffany, as well. I have recommended her in the past and will continue to do so in the future.  "
2266,39384,0.0,"Dr. Nelsen is very nice, understanding and always takes the time to listen to all of your issues with patience and does not rush you through your appointment as other doctors do.  "
2267,39385,0.0,"I went in to have a crown that fell off put back on and left with an $18,000 estimate with no explanation of the work to be performed. This is the worst dentist / dental experience I have ever had and would steer far far away from this doctor and Bright Now Dental as an organization. The cost at another dentist for the work is $4.2k including a root canal but at least I got a through honest exam and honest pricing.  "
2268,39385,0.0,"I think I need search her before I saw.It is same as before post, rude, also she let me do deep cleaning and crown rework. I have put a lots money for this visit. "
2269,39385,0.0,"Dr Nurani suggested many unnecessary procedures -- deep cleaning, crowns rework, etc. She didn't even clean my teeth, just rinsed them, and told me that I had no tartar build-up and hardly any plaque.  Then why would I need a deep cleaning&#63; "
2270,39385,0.0,Dr. Nurani is a HORRIBLE dentist - she was VERY rude when I said I never had to have a deep cleanng and she kept poking my gums and hurting me telling me I had gum disease.  She also kept insisting i had crowns redone that I had just had placed 6 months by my brother who is a dentist in another city!  STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!!!! 
2271,39386,0.0,"May be the WORST doctor ever! She actually failed to tell me very important details that could have killed me if I didn't know enough to question her. She usually late but never even apologized. She pretty much always needs me to make an apt, even for a Rx refil 6mh after my last apt. She finds a reason to need to see me most every time I call but I don't believe she ever once told me to make a F/U apt. Once she actally tried to hand me my lab work, do a quick chest phyiscal and leave the room in less than 5 min with barely a word spoken to me. I made her stay but why am I paying for her to listen to my lungs and heart and check all my neck glands every few months when there is nothing &quot;wrong&quot; I was just there for may lab work which she never reviewed with me so why not just mail it so I don't have to spend a a portion of my day at her office for a 15m apt plus pay my portion after insurance. I honestly wonder if she just needs to fill her schedule. I think she is a HORRIBLE doctor.  "
2272,39387,0.0,Dr. Naficy's wife runs the insurance billing and works at the front desk. She has the WORST people skills and is very rude. I was over charged and had to get my insurance involved since they were an in-network provider. After many months they had to repay me the overpayment per the contract they hold with the insurance company. My insurance co. was not happy with them when they found out exactly what they had been doing. I didn't have any problems with Dr. Naficy himself. Know your insurance policy and get your insurance involved by filing a claim against them if they try to overcharge you. 
2273,39387,0.0,"His wife runs the front desk and her management skills are Terrible! Everytime I tried to call she kept putting me on hold. I hardly got a sentance out. Your apt maybe at 2pm but youll sit there for a hour waiting. I over paid by 3,000 and my teeth still arent the way I would like them. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR YOUR MONEY HERE!! YOU CAN FIND BETTER!! "
2274,39387,0.0,Very bad service and they are asking me pay the remaining amount though my insurance company said i will get a waiver for being in network but the staff there are not accepting without i pay the difference. very much money minded 
2275,39387,0.0,"Terrible, he was unhelpful. All he did was come in check by teeth and leave. My teeth have not improved.  "
2276,39388,0.0,Dr Numrych is such a great dr! She's so kind and considerate and always answers your questions even if they're not related to the reason why you came for the visit. I've never felt rushed our put out. I would highly recommend her! 
2277,39388,0.0,VERY LATE. 2HOURS 
2278,39389,2.0,Dr Nelson delivered all three of my babies and was amazing! 
2279,39390,1.0,"Dr. Nickel delivered my first son in 2010 and he was really great. I felt comfortable with him from the beginning to the end of my pregnancy. His staff was also incredible. Being a FTM at the time, I called a lot and they were always so nice, even at my appointments. Most importantly, I was never talked down to or felt dumb for all my calls. I have since moved cross country and  pregnsn with #2 and I hate the office I am at now and have little faith in my new doctor ;( I wish i were back in Tacoma! I would recommend Dr. Nickel to anyone! "
2280,39390,1.0,"In addition to being available to answer all of my questions no matter how tedious, Dr. Nickle is amazing.  Don't let his humble, easy going nature fool you.  I went into labor at 6 months my first preganacy (which was delayed until the 39th week).  In the ER the ER nurse told me that her her uterus ruptured on her tenth and last birth. Dr. Nickel saved her life.  I am VERY high risk and I am purposefully going out of network and paying more to be his patient for my second.  His office isn't fancy, he doesn't drone on and on about the latest gimmicks BUT he and his staff are the BEST. "
2281,39390,1.0,"I wouldnt trust my reproductive health to anyone else. He is great at answering questions, you just have to ask.  "
2282,39390,1.0,Dr. Nickel likes you to follow his advice to the letter. He is strict but very smart. I felt very safe having him deliver my two sons. He is also a strong Christian if that is important to you.  
2283,39390,1.0,very caring sometimes his bedside manner can be improved military background might be cause. 
2284,39390,1.0,Have been seeing Dr. Nickel for my first pregnancy and am mostly satisfied.  Had some confusion about getting me scheduled for my appointments and 1st u/s.  Being new to this I expected them to tell me at what intervals I should schedule my appointments; ended up missing a month.  Not a big deal.  His staff have been very helpful whenever I call with questions.  Quite professional in spite of earlier confusion.  
2285,39390,1.0,When I was 5 months pregnant my insuranced changed so I had to find a new Ob.  I called his officed asked if they took my insurance they said yes.  So I made an appointment the earliest I could get in was 3 weeks.  When I came in for my appiontment I gave the receptionist my insurance card.  I was called back did an intake with the nurse then saw the doctor.  He asked alot of questions asked why I had medicare.  I explained I had become disabled temporarily due to an accident.  He told me he doesn't take my insurance and doesn't take high risk patients.  He told me to find a perinantologist.  He gave me one name and a phone number.  No referal. I wasted alot of time.  His office does bill my insurance he just did'nt want to take over my care.  The other doctor he told me to call wouldn't see me with out a referal.  They only work with your regular ob to monitor your care.  He was very rude.  Don't waste your time going to him if your pregnant.  
2286,39391,1.0,"very nice guy, may seem kind of weird but he actually knows what he is doing. "
2287,39392,0.0,DR BRUCE NEU DID MY SURGERY FOR CARPEL TUNAL OR KNOWEN AS ( RSI ) MY LEFT HAND DID NOT TAKE AND MY RIGHT HAND DID. I DID NOT FOLLOW UP WITH HAND THERAPY AFTER I WOULD TELL HIM MY LEFT HAND IS STILL IN PAIN AND NOT ABLE TO USE IT VERY WELL HE DID NOT WANT TO BE BOTHERED BY MY CONCERNS. I DONT THINK HE DOES (RSI( SURGERY ANY MORE BUT DOES PLASTIC SURGERY. I WOULD HAVE TO ASK HIS NURSE TO LET HIM KNOW NOT TO CUT ME OFF WHEN I AM TRY TO TALK TO HIM OR DISMISS MY CONCERNS....THE REPLY FROM HIS NURSE THAT I WAS NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO WOULD TELL HER THAT HE IS RUDE AND I MEAN OUT RIDE RUDE 
2288,39393,2.0,I liked this dentist until I got the bills. The office staff promised me BEFORE I got the work done that they would adjust their pricing to what my insurance listed the procedure to be worth. They not only did not do this - they did procedures on me that they knew in advance that my insurance did not cover at all. When I protested what they charged me they sent me to collections. Here is one dentist I will not go back to! 
2289,39394,0.0,"Kudos to my dentist Dr. Amy Norman! I had a dental emergency based on an intemperate chomp upon a corn chip resulting in the fracturing of my temporary crown. Less than an hour later I'm in Amy's chair, nitrous oxide flowing, a brand new crown being installed.?Trust me. If you don't love, love,love your dentist consider switching. AND every single person in her office is equally awesome "
2290,39394,0.0,I travel 300 miles to go to Dr Norman. She and her team are simply amazing. Her attention to detail and customer service are second to none. I actually look forward to going to the dentist now. I wish all medical professionals would model their practices after Dr. Norman’s. 
2291,39395,2.0,Very helpful in understanding wisdom teeth extraction. Straight forward staff.  
2292,39396,0.0,"Dr.Neering seemed to be distracted when I came in for regular check-ups but I thought things would improve as we got near to my sons due date. Unfortunately, I did not progress well and the baby was projected at being 12lbs. Dr.Neering was irritated that this may ruin her streak of performing few c-sections and she proceeded to yell at me, them while giving me a exam she tried to force her fingers up violently into my cervix. I almost flew off the top of the table screaming in pain. Later as the need was apparent she rushed me into the o.r. with little conversation and let the local med students perform a c-section. I was crying and no curtain was put up, I could literally see the whole procedure while these strange students yanked me around like a piece of meat. I begged how much longer and Dr.Neering snapped, &quot;We would of been done already if you weren't so damn fat&quot;! So much more verbal abuse happened during this nightmare delivery, nobody is safe in her hands.  "
2293,39397,1.0,"We have used this dentist for about 5 years now.  Front office staff very nice and professional.  Hygienists are both very nice and do a good job.  The office is pretty &quot;high tech&quot; and we like that (I've talked to others who feel like that just adds expense).  Dr. Nathe is a good dentist.  He fit me in one day when I had badly chipped a front tooth.  I did have to sit for quite awhile, as he would come and work on my tooth repair in between already-scheduled patients, but I really appreciated their flexibility and he got it fixed asap.  I like him overall and intend to keep going there.  "
2294,39398,1.0,"Dr. Naylor has a great repoire with his patients. He has never rushed us through a visit, he sits down and listens to any concern we have. He doesn't do unnecessary tests, but when he's not positive of what may be going on, he will order whatever test he feels necessary. In the 7 years we've been going to him, he has always come in the room with a smile, he has always treated my children and myself with respect, and he has always listened to us. His diagnosis' have been spot on. It's nice to have a doctor that truly cares about his patients and provides the best service possible. As for waiting times, this facility has the best. Nine out of ten times, we are pulled within a minute of our scheduled appointment. The nurse gets all the info and stats and the doctor is in within 10 minutes. There have been maybe a handful of times  (in 7 years) where we weren't seen right away, but it was always because of a more pressing situation. "
2295,39399,1.0,"Outstanding surgeon and a compassionate healer. Dr. Nguyen genuinely cares about his patients and it shows. I have never felt a doctor so &quot;in my corner&quot; before, listening to my concerns, understanding my issues, and rooting for me to be healthy. What a great guy and extremely skilled in his specialty. I recommend him without reservation. He is very informed and experienced and is the head of the Bariatric Program at the Overlake Hospital Specialty Clinics.  "
2296,39400,1.0,We went to Dr. Norfleet for early entrance to Kindergarten testing for our son.  My son tends to be shy and very attached to me I was worried about how he would do without me in the room. Dr.Norfleet made him feel so comfortable he did not even care that I was not in the room.  He had so much fun doing the testing he asked me if we could go back the next day! He kept telling his brother and sister that he played at Dr. Norfleets office! 
2297,39401,1.0,"Dr. Nacht is a great surgeon, he is very informative. "
2298,39401,1.0,"Excellent bed side mannor, very knowledgeable. Dont feel rushed and he always answers all my questions, no matter if i have asked them before. Puts his patients at ease before, during and after surgery. or treatment.  "
2299,39402,2.0,Took x-rays and  took my money but didn't give appropriate treatment.  
2300,39403,1.0,"I am a patient of Dr Newman and dont understand the last review. I had been to multiple doctors over the years -one even said I needed surgery and at the suggestion of a friend who is a patient of Dr Newmans, I went to him. He has been a life saver - very knowledgable and mixes Western Medicine with Naturopathic. I like that I pay cash as I dont have to worry about insurance (although his office does bill my insurance and I get a refund from them). "
2301,39403,1.0,"Demanding nearly $500 cash up front should have been a red flag! What followed was no less than a nightmare. I am reluctant to be specific as I am concerned about possible repercussions. That fact alone should speak volumes. It is unfortunate that Dr. Newman has covered the internet with propaganda that gives potential patients a false sense of who and what he his. Since this experience with Newman another Dr. shared information that could have prevented this entire experience. It is unfortunate that this information wasn't available before trusting him with life altering treatment. Please, ask around - colleagues may be willing to share valuable information. I wish that I could be more specific as it is important for anyone considering treatment at this office to ask questions.  This was originally erroneously posted under Dr. ALAN Newman, also a naturopath in Vancouver. Given the similarities I believe the comments there are actually intended for THIS Dr. Newman. "
2302,39404,1.0,"back when this ass was in vancouver, he did what was suppossed to be a scar revision surgery.  He hands were shaking like someone on drugs they shouldn't of taken, but worse than that instead of a scar revision,he did a punch biopsy into healthy tissue, resulting in infection that took over a month of heavy duty antibiotics and a huge scar versus a little 2 cm scar.  When I went back post op to voice my concerns, he didn't listen virtually at all, and completely dismissed me with a waving of the hands.  I found someone else to fix me up eventually but newell was a nightmare for me. he really messed me up with what should of been a very simple procedure.   that was over 15 years ago, but I still remember clearly how badly he treated me professionally and as a person "
2303,39404,1.0,This NS ordered me to submit yearly MRI's. He neglected to read them for the 9 years I submitted my MRI's to him to read. Imagine my shock to learn that he allowed my brain tumor to grow so big it was inoperable. I was given 2 to 3 months to live.  
2304,39405,2.0,Very rushed and seemed somewhat condescending if I balked at a treatment option. Affiliated with the medical center which charges a large fee for facility charge. 
2305,39406,1.0, 
2306,39406,1.0,"Dr. Nieman is an extraordinary physician. He was able to diagnose my autoimmune disorder when multiple doctors had failed, and as a result, I am able to walk again without being in constant pain. I have been seeing him now for over five years and he always listens, asks good questions, never makes me feel that he is in a rush to see others. I also like that he has been able to help me manage my illness without resorting to painkillers or other potentially risky medications. He is the most outstanding medical professional and I am so grateful to him for the way he helped me.  "
2307,39406,1.0,"Dr Neiman is a really good doctor. He was my doc for about 5 years and did all he could to help me. In the end I decided to stop seeing him because I feel he acted irresponsibly, but know that is not normal for him. What happened in my case was a deal breaker for me, but not something I had ever seen before and not something I can see happening again. He listens very patiently, answers all of your questions thouroughly and will say he doesn't know if he doesn't know. But he will find out the answer. On my first visit I was prescribed pain meds, muscle relaxers, nerve pain meds and sleeping pills.  It sounds extreme but it was necessary. That's the good thing about him. We see him because we are in extreme pain and he treats that pain. He doesn't make you feel like you are drug seeking like some doctors do. He understands we need help or we wouldn't be there. I am just sorry he's not my doctor anymore. Unfortunate was that deal breaker.  "
2308,39406,1.0,I have seen Dr. Neiman for 10+ years. His clinical skills are excellent. He listens and never makes me feel rushed. He understands that in Rheumatology things are often not clear cut and some medications work better than others for different patients. He is patient and kind. I feel that he keeps up on the current literature and I feel well taken care of.  
2309,39406,1.0,"I've been to Dr Neiman for about 5 years now. I have multiple issues and he takes the time to talk with me, does not talk at me. He listens and explains things in 'plain English' so I can understand what it is. HE lets my other docs know about things when it's appropriate or advises me to talk to to them about a certain issue. Only one problem was w/the front desk person. 1 time she confused my name w/another patient.. long story short.. I caught the error, and was not even apologized to.  "
2310,39406,1.0,"Very good, highly recommend.  Probably the most caring physician I've every encountered.  He returns phone calls personally!!!  This man is a wonderful doctor, with vast knowledge in a difficult specialty.  "
2311,39406,1.0,"i think Dr. Neiman is a good doc. He cares about his patients. I do not know how he can handle so many. It is a difficult profession dealing with Rhuematoid, athritis, ostoarthrits, Lupus, MCTD&lt; and many other autoimmune disorders which are difficult to manage . As well as try to be there to help get pts help with other problems. He is cooperative in trying yet certainly sticks to his specailty. He is absolutely a GREAT guy. He is doing his best despite the ridiculous new Washington State guidelines that many docs are mistakenly thinking are RULES. I would say he is hesitant to exceed at certain times- which is reasonable even if you atre the one in AGONY. We all need to respect our physicians and their limitations more. I think he is knowledgable and tries and honest. He NEVER acts arrogant . Never acts like he knows it all. The bestdocs will say I do not know when they don't. Some people don't like that. I respect it.  "

2313,39408,1.0,"The first orthopedist messed up my casting and after 4 weeks he discovered that he set it wrong.  I was referred to Dr. North and surgery was done w/in a week.   Not a lot of personality or bed side manner, but a great surgeon! "
2314,39408,1.0,"My hand was shredded in a mover blade from a riding John Deere mower. Thank God,  I just happened to get Dr. North on his weekend on call.  He put me back together,  where others would have amputated some. This happened in 1992, My hand is so close to perfect. You would never know I had surgery....   Thank you "
2315,39409,1.0,"Dr. Nitsche is an excellent primary care physician.  He has excellent resources in the community of Seattle and Bainbridge Island specialists.  My annual physical appointment with him is not something I dread, it is a careful review that I value and the written report is very helpful to bring along to any specialist visit I may have.  "
2316,39410,1.0,"I thought he was worthless and greedy, staff didn't appear very happy either, but he's probably rude to them too "
2317,39410,1.0,"I found Dr Newman to be a self proclaimed know it all, pompous, rude and not one for listening to the patient.  Very expensive.  Initial visit was nothing but intake and he said ok we will schedule you for a physical exam next week, so over 200 dollars and he didn't do so much as a bllod pressure check&#63;&#63;&#63;  There may be some people he helps by getting them to lose weight, nutritional counseling etc.  but My personal opinion, hes a rip off, and he really likes to sell IV chelation (potentially deadly, but nessesary if someone REALLY has lead poisening, based on one of the tests that are considered by many experts to be bogus...let the buyer beware! "
2318,39411,0.0,Very professional and smart. She knows what she is talking about and is able to care for patients as a &quot;whole&quot; and not just a diagnosis. I would highly recommend Dr. Nohara to anybody.  
2319,39423,0.0,.   
2320,39423,0.0," I have been seeing Dr. O'Connell for years & liked her until now.But my recent visit to her was my 1st time seeing her since TTC.Wow.She was an entirely different doctor,and one that I will NEVER see again.Her bedside manner is NONEXISTENT.In the past I interpreted her behavior as being straightforward and even appreciated it.Appointments were quick & I liked that.I guess I was OK w/ it because I had never had any real issues/concerns.Well,now that I am TTC and I have some concerns I would like to discuss.I have never had a doctor so disinterested in my concerns and my well-being.She in no way,shape,or form listened to my concerns,much less be open to discussing possible causes or help come up with a diagnosis or solution.She brushed me off and kicked me to the curb.She completely dismissed me and my questions.I left feeling horrible and confused. Needless to say,I immediately solicited recommendations for other ob/gyns and made an appt. with another clinic for next week. Good riddance! "
2321,39423,0.0," Spends a lot of time with you, cares about you and your total well-being and health. "
2322,39436,0.0," Dr. O'Neil, with Northwest Women's Health is outstanding! She is very knowledgable in answering questions, takes time to get to know you (I never felt rushed), she really listens and is concerned about you. For all three of my pregnancies I felt I received the best care - including during 6 weeks bedrest with my second pregnancy. I highly recommend Dr.  O'Neil, but if you can't get into her, all the doctors in the office are great! "
2323,39440,0.0," Even though the dentist is not my favorite person to visit, Dr.  O'Brien and her staff are so warm and welcoming and friendly! "
2324,39442,0.0, Didn't care for her. 
2325,39444,2.0," After 2+ years of being treated for the same condition that couldn't be pinpointed, this doctor refused antibiotic treatment to me after I had a documented infection.  Within a month, my system turned septic and I almost died.  I wouldn't recommend this Group Health doctor to my worst enemy.  "
2326,39452,1.0," I saw Casey Okeefe because my GP had me get a PSA test on my routine blood test and the PSA came back slightly elevated. I picked Mr. Okeefe out of the yellow pages. I was very unimpressed with him do to his obvious lack of interest and extremely arrogant attitude, which was so thick you could cut it with a knife. He spent very little time talking with me and acted as though I was wasting his time. He told me to get another PSA test but failed to mention that prior to the test, I should avoid any sexual activity for a couple of days as this raises the PSA reading. This should be some very important basic advice for a GOOD urologist to pass along to a patient. I had to find this out myself on the internet and it was confirmed by my GP. He tried doing a digital exam but couldn't feel my prostate. He never tried having me move to a fetal position which gives better access to the prostate. I went to another doctor who had me do that and he checked it just fine. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!!!!!! "
2327,39452,1.0, Dr. Okeefe diagnosed me with chronic prostatitis by only doing a DRE without and bacterial cultures or any other imaging tests. He refused to do anything else for me and cut me off in the middle of my visit. I was trying to tell him my symptoms and suggest that I wanted him to rule out some other possibilities. Im in chronic pain and it is important that I get a doctors help to gain all the possible information I can about my disease. He just shuffled me out the door without any hope. I have never seen a doctor so unwilling to answer questions or offer help. Avoid him and find someone who is in this business for the right reasons. 
2328,39452,1.0, He is knowledgeable but not proactive. Doesn't explain options and missed the cancer. Does not follow up and is not the person to see if you have any form of cancer.  Sorry 
2329,39452,1.0," Dr O'keefe removed one of my kidneys,  I could not be more pleased about how he handled everything. "
2330,39452,1.0," Dr O'Keefe is recognized as one of &quot;the best&quot; in his field. He has conducted my prostate examinations for the past 3 years. Early this year (Feb 08)he conducted a prostate biopsy. He is understnding, explains options clearly and has always &quot;followed&quot; up and answered any questions. I would recommend him HIGHLY. "
2331,39457,0.0, Worst experience that I have EVER had with any doctor in my life! I went in with SEVERE abdominal pain and she examined me and did a blood test and noticed that my levels were extremely elevated. She sent me home with and with a perscription for a suppository for nausea. 2 days later I went back to the office with the SAME exact problem. The nurse acted like I was being a baby about the pain and had me wait for the doctor. Lucky for me that Mary O'Brien was not there that day because an older doctor in the office looked at my chart and asked me why I was there. I started to explain to him that I was there for the same problem that I was there for earlier and he said you need to be in the hospital and proceeded to call me an ambulance right then and there! All this from looking at my chart for 3 minutes! I went in for emergency gallbladder surgery that same day! I had been passing gallstones and one of them was causing a blockage and my organs were shutting down! Please beware! 
2332,39459,0.0," Dr. O'Neill is superb.  She deserves higher ratings than a &quot;5&quot; as she is also part of this community and knows her patients well.  She has been caring for my 3 sons since 1999.  She has excellent bedside manner and my children are very comfortable with her.  She is very popular and is hard to get into for last minute appointments.  But if you schedule in advance, you can get on her calendar.  "
2333,39459,0.0," Dr. O'Neil is a fabulous doctor. She is very personable, has a great relationship with our kids and us. She will order appropriate tests and always assists us in getting seem promptly by specialists. She is caring, compassionate and knowledgable. She does have a wait but that's because she spends time with her patients and never appears rushed. We just call ahead to find out if she is ruuning behind.  I highly recommend her! "
2334,39459,0.0, I love this doctor! I like her relaxed approach when seeing my child. I like that she will work with you if you have reservations about vaccinations or would like to go with a different vax'ing schedule. I always feel good when we leave her office. 
2335,39469,1.0, Still getting bills after a two part brain surgery dr ogrady totally botched and almost killed me where we went to uw medicine physician @ harborview in seattle and found out they not only botched it by making him sick with a necrotic packing but had not even removed the brain tumor!!!  The dr @ uw medicine remove 98% of the tumor in one surgery that didin't cut the entire side of my head open like ogrady did in part one of his but did the whole thing through my nose.  Which was part two of ogrady's surgical approach. Ogrady removed 15 - 20% max in both parts but told us he removed the majority of tumor but computers were never working when we were there so he could show us. Well uw meds computers worked and we saw the scans taken @ the hospital following ogrady's surgeries so no claims of grow back in a I week period.  
2336,39479,0.0, Took my 4 year old to Dr O'Brien. Very nice office! They made it so fun for her that she seemed very relaxed! At the end they took a photo with her and the DR. She also got a token that was good for a prize of her choice.I would highly reccomend this office! 
2337,39479,0.0, I went to Dr. O'Brien from my first dentist visit till i was 18. As did my brother who is 7 years older then me.  I now have my daughter going there and i still love it! 
2338,39479,0.0," Rude, full of themselves.  Don't bother unless you have a stomach for people like that.  Expensive too.  "
2339,39479,0.0, Dr. O'Brien specializes in Pediatric Dentistry and has been working in this field for 20+ years. He is very gentle with children and his main concern is always the child's well-being. He has never compromised my children's sense of security by making them do something that they don't understand. The rest of the staff is wonderfully warm with the children as well and do everything in their power to make sure the child is comfortable. Dr. O'Brien makes uses the latest technology to make sure the child's teeth are healthy. Wonderful clinic! 
2340,39481,1.0, i have bad back problems and he will not give me meds for pain or GRANT ME AN MRI he say's theripy will do i went and the threapist told me that this was a waste of time and i should get an mri but O'Kinsella still say's noso now i'm stuck with pain every day and i have two children under the age of 3 and no help in sight!!!!!!! 
2341,39482,0.0," Horrible, horrible doctor. Do NOT go to Dr. O'Halloran if you want a doctor who will listen to what you have to say. She provides no actual help to patients and instead likes to argue with them. Just because she is a doctor does not mean that she knows how I am feeling inside but when you try to explain this to her, she gets extremely angry and storms out of the room. Please do not go to this doctor. If you care about your health, find another doctor.  "
2342,39486,0.0, Didn't like the lady she wasn't very helpful and when she was asked for a reference wouldn't give one if her life depended upon it wouldn't go back to her if she was the last doctor on the island.  
2343,39486,0.0," This lady knew little about chronic medical care, even diabetes.  She took care of my elderly mother and was unwilling or unable to recognize when my mother was having an allergic reaction to her medication.  She also was unwilling to listen when we tried to ask her about this. Finally after a trip to the Swedish Emergency Department, my mother was taken off the medication, several other meds were changed and her health and well-being improved about 50%.Dr O'Neil was very snooty about these changes and refused to acknowledge her own errors and oversights.  I do not recommend this woman for care of anyone.  "
2344,39486,0.0,.  Great for elderly women 
2345,39490,0.0," Dr. O'Keefe sincerely listens to her patients and understands that her patients have a unique point of view in that they are the occupants of their own bodies, and therefore should participate actively in their treatment.  "
2346,39499,2.0, pays attention and remembers you tests responses to drugs works to find what works for you 
2347,39506,2.0, This office is wonderful! I was nervous about my dental work but they made me feel very relaxed and comfortable...no pain at all!  The staff is friendly and the office is beautiful. I will definately tell my friends. 
2348,39511,2.0,  
2349,39513,0.0,"Dr. Paras is the best! My entire family goes to her, &amp; we all highly recommend her. She won't hesitate to send us to a specialist, she calls to check on us if we are seeing a specialist and wants to know what we think about our treatment. She will take our phone calls and basically do whatever she needs to make us feel comfortable and confident about our diagnoses and treatments.  We trust her completely! "
2350,39513,0.0,"Dr. Paras is an extremely knowledgable, professional and caring doctor.  She goes out of her way to make sure that she understands your concerns and that you receive the treatment that you need.  She is very good at providing the whole range of treatment that is appropriate from a family practitioner, and when something is beyond her scope of knowledge/training she and her staff are great at managing the process of referring you to a specialist and following up to make sure that you get the treatment that you need.  She is a true Family Practice doctor and the fact that she treats my husband and myself plus both of our children makes it very convenient if there is something contagious going through the house.   She was recommended to me by a friend who also raved about her and I, in turn, would not hesitate to recommend her to anyone "
2351,39513,0.0,"Dr. Paras is GREAT, She's never rushed, takes her time and answers any questions I have. I have been going to her for 4 yrs. She does everything and is very thorough. She also has a great sense of humor and is very friendly.I highly recommend her.  "
2352,39514,1.0,"The clinic and staff are great. Not like anything I expected, having seen other clinics on the south side that could all learn a lesson on customer service from RBI and Scott's staff. Always pleased! "
2353,39514,1.0,This guy does care and he gave me more real results than I could have ever asked for from any other doctor. His site www.professionalpsychiatry.com is great! 
2354,39514,1.0,"Been to over five psychiatrists, and will stay with Scott. He always knows his stuff, has great staff, and he cares, is very genuine, professional, and plays no games. Got the right meds and great psychotherapy. Never felt better. "
2355,39516,2.0,"Lacks knowledge.  Diagnosed me with lack of thyroid function, put me on high strength medication until another doctor told me that absolutely nothing was wrong with my thyroid! "
2356,39517,2.0,"This was an in-network doctor, so this is who I saw for foot pain. The problem has improved somewhat, but this doctor's billing and bookkeeping is extremely inaccurate and inefficient. Following the first appointment, the insurance paid a small portion, but the bill for the balance arrived too late to file for medical flex spending so it was paid out of pocket. It was then that I discovered I was billed for &quot;custom&quot; orthotics. (Insurance pays for orthotics, but not nearly what these cost.) Since I'd signed the standard insurance waiver, I was responsible. There was no initial explanation that these were custom and therefore probably wouldn't be covered. In spite of this bad experience, I went for a second visit. Once insurance had paid, I received a bill showing a balance forward with no supporting data. Paid the bill anyway, and now, two months later, I'm told the account is being sent to collections for nonpayment. Needless to say, I won't be returning.  "
2357,39517,2.0,"We are fortunate to be double covered in insurance but thier office will only bill the primary insurance company.  I submitted the remainder of the balance to the secondary insurance company and they sent the check to the Dr. office even though I had already paid the Dr.  When I called the Dr.'s office for a refund (around $500), I was given the run around.  My calls to the accountant were not returned and the receptionist told me I had to wait &quot;my turn&quot; which would be approximately 30 days.  I threw a fit and when I said I would be coming personally to the office to talk to the Dr., the accountant called me and I had a check the next day. "
2358,39517,2.0,Treatments did not work. Rude staff. Unresolved billing issues. I felt they were all unprofessional. They talked badly about me to their other patients - and it got back to me.  
2359,39518,1.0,"I couldn't recommend Dr. Partington more for reconstructive surgery. He's incredibly gifted and he seems to honestly care about his patients. I went in after suffering a chemical burn on my scalp that left me with a bald spot. After a couple of surgeries the bald spot is gone, albeit I'll have a scar for life but that is just the cost of the chemical burn. He was wonderful and I highly recommend him. "
2360,39518,1.0,"I have had weight issues my entire life. I had a lap-band in 9/07, I was in a major car accident 4 months later, I had back surgery because of this accident, and I was diagnosed with Hasimoto’s disease. This had a negative impact on my overall health and mental wellbeing. I knew that I was going to struggle the rest of my life with my weight.  I decided to have liposuction on several areas to use as a tool, to help concur a healthier lifestyle.  Dr. Partington was an excellent jump start to my overall health. Dr. Partington and his staff made me feel very comfortable, they had every base covered and I appreciated the honesty and professionalism they provided. Rachel is one of the sweetest, most helpful nurse assistance. Dr. Partington is a gifted plastic surgeon. He has wonderful bedside manners and treats you like an individual and not just a number. He is very compassionate, concerned about you as a person, your journey and your final result.  I recommend Dr. P to everyone I know. "
2361,39518,1.0,amazing office.  Dr P and staff were very helpful explaining the procedure to me.  Wonderful pre and post treatment.  Would highly recommend Dr to friends and family.  I am a very satisfied patient. 
2362,39519,2.0,Very friendly and skilled working with me to get my eyes rechecked and fit for contacts.  Easy to work with. 
2363,39520,1.0,". Dr P has done both of my c sections and will be doing a 3rd in a few months, i recommend dr paley to women who have had at least one child previously unless you are a no nonsense kind of person, not that Dr P wouldnt answer your questions hes just very fast and efficient and a no need to waste time kinda Dr, whos still i appreciate and like he doesnt BS around he just does his job answers your questions and lets go on your way, if you are someone who needs someone to listen to your 500 questions and needs to be explained everything in detail and you dont trust your OB then this is not the Dr for you! "
2364,39520,1.0,"I would NOT recommend Dr. Paley to anyone. He was on-call doctor at the Overlake Hospital (where my child was born) and he saw me the day after the delivery, in order to discharge me. Unfortunately, the OB who was following my pregnancy from the very beginning was not available. I had some post-delivery concerns, which I voiced to him and his exact words to me were: &quot;There is no return policy, okay&#63;&quot; Very condescending. He didn't answer my questions or was helpful in any way. I wouldn't choose this &quot;doctor&quot; for myself in the million years. I went to my OB afterwards and what a difference in bedside manner and empathy. Shame on you, &quot;Doctor&quot; Paley.  "
2365,39520,1.0,Poor service.  Patronizing attitude.  Was recommended by  friends as a good ob but I didn't bond to him.  
2366,39520,1.0,Dr. with good patience and bedside manners; listens to you and answers all questions very well.  
2367,39520,1.0,"If you are female and post-childbearing years, I would discourage your selecting this doctor.  I felt like he was on a clock (10 min. max per patient) and he had to get in and out to his next patient, regardless of my questions regarding peri-menopause (I had three).  Questions were answered abruptly, i.e., &quot;I'm sure you don't want to consider HRTs so sometimes you just have to learn to deal with it.&quot;  My favorite response had to do with decreased libido during peri-menopause.  Expressing little empathy, he told me that sometimes you just have to 'reach for the astro-glide and just tough it out.'  I will not be returning.  "
2368,39520,1.0,"Dr. Paley delivered both my sons in unscheduled c-sections. He is attentive, laid-back, reassuring and explains complicated matters in easy to understand terms. On my first delivery, they had to induce labor. He stopped by the hosptial that night to check on me and the nursing staff watched his young kids while he tended to me. For my second delivery, he came in early in the morning before he had to leave on vacation. The timing was lucky but, in both cases, I really appreciated how he made the effort to take care of me and not turn the delivery over to the doctor on call. Also, as an &quot;older than average&quot; mother, I had a lot of questions and concerns. He always took plenty of time in my appointments to address all my concerns and his staff was helpful, responsive and pleasant during appointments and on the phone. I had a few complications following the second delivery, and he called me directly a few times to check on my progress.  "
2369,39520,1.0,"Dr. Paley has great bedside manner and I found him to be a very sincere and an excellent OB.  He delivered my 1st 2 sons, in 1999 and 2003.  He was on vacation for the delivery of my 3rd son in 2006.  These were all c-sections, the 1st 2 being emergency ones.  He answered all of my questions each time honestly and in laymen's terms.  He was not condescending.  He never seemed in a hurry.  I think that he is one of the best OB/Gyn's in the area.  Even though he is in a big practice, he makes you feel like you are in a small practice.  "
2370,39520,1.0,"dr. paley delivered both of my daughters. The first was by unplanned c-section, following 9 hours of labor. I got an infection from the surgery 3 weeks later which was most likely due to some placenta being left inside me. That said, Dr. Paley was very attentive and even took the time to call me from home on one of his days off. My second c-section was scheduled and went off without a hitch.  "
2371,39520,1.0,"I was referred to Dr. Paley by my primary care physician.  My diagnosis required surgery and was very scary.  It does appear he is tightly booked but he would slow down and waited for expected Q&A.;  Surgery was successful without complications/infection, etc.  Trying to get in for the annual(plan for three months) is difficult but not really for other issues that have come up.  I think he leans on staff to vet inquiries quite a bit so that's expected.  "
2372,39520,1.0,"I'm a young girl and seeing an OBGYN was extremely awkward and scary experience for me but he made it the best it could be.  He has a very quirky presense to him so awkward moments breeze by.  He doesn't aknowledge the fact that i'm freaking out, which was so nice.  His nurse, Morgan, is amazing and extremely helpful and always calls me back promptly and puts me at ease.  I'm happy there so far but I secretly wish i had a high risk pregnancy because although Dr. Paley is extremely knowledgeable, I'm seven months pregnant now and i feel he has only used about 1/10 of his beans on me.  "
2373,39520,1.0,"I had an appointment with Jonathan Paley for uterine bleeding due to perimenopause. He said he wanted to perform a straw biopsy to see what was going on. Instead of the straw biopsy he performed a D&C; without anesthesia. It was SO painful! I was home in bed in extreme pain for a week. My husband thought I should be admitted to the hospital. I called the office and talked to his nurse about the bleeding. She was completely surprised with the description of the procedure he had done. She was not in the room with him and me. I made the follow up visit with another of their doctors, she said &quot;he's a good doctor that got carried away.&quot; I reported him to the director of the clinic and they said to not come back to their clinic since I am not happy with their care. Would you be happy with surgery performed on you without your consent and without anesthesia&#63; He is not trustworthy to do what has been agreed on for treatment. "
2374,39520,1.0,"Dr.Paley had great bedside manner and was the first doctor that got to the bottom of what was wrong with me after so many doctors said nothing was wrong. He was very nice and knew what he was talking about. What I did not like is that I feel he is overbooked and does not have the time to really deal with your case.He was in and out in a minute, I felt he cared (unlike many doctors I have seen) but was rushed. He was hard to get ahold of as I was dealing with a matter that needed immediate treatment and I felt that even though his immediate treatment and tests he did for me were done quickly, for me to find out about the followup treatment required me to call him over and over without a clear answer to when he was going to get me in or what was going to be done to treat the problem. I am still dealing with this so I will update again once my situation is taken care of. Hopefully I will have nothing but great words about the rest of my treatment. "
2375,39520,1.0,Jonathan paley was recommended to me by a very close friend and is recommended by many women according to a friend who works with him. I believe it. He has an excellent bed side manner. Very knowledgeable and helpful! I'm not one that is comfortable around male doctors being a female myself but I am comfortable around Dr. Paley and his staff. I highly recommend Jonathan Paley!!! 
2376,39520,1.0,Very laid back doctor who doesn't sweat the small things. Has great perspective. Has been a blessing to have - knowledgeable and supportive. 
2377,39520,1.0,"Dr. Paley has delivered 2 of my children and I think he is excellent as a dr. He isn't pushy, he is balanced and knowlegeable. I think he has a good bedside manner. "
2378,39521,1.0,"Dr Peterson, had me take an MRI and X rays. He decline to look at my x rays until the MRI was done. I did both MRI and X-Rays the same day as the appointment. Dr Peterson gave he his word he would call me in couple of days with the result/ diagnosis and treatment plan. He never called. I called his nurse 3 times she did not return my calls. I invested time and money for no diagnosis, no results and no treatment plan.  "
2379,39521,1.0,"What can I say, this is the best doctor I've ever seen.  Repaired my ACL and it is as good as new.  Great at counseling, best at surgery -- he's a rock star in knee surgery. "
2380,39521,1.0,"Dr. Peterson was very helpful in preliminary appointments but unfortunately  I am very dissatisfied with the service of Providence Medical Center and this doctor.I showed up on the day of my surgery just as I was told and was unfortunately informed that my surgery was cancelled. The surgery had been cancelled a week before, but I didn't receive one phone call telling me of this. I think it was very unprofessional. Also, if you're looking for your medical records, good luck, you won't get them until you call them everyday for two weeks, they'll finally get annoyed enough and hand them over.  "
2381,39521,1.0,"Dr. Peterson is my life saver! After seeing a few orthopedics about my knee, he told me straight up what needs to happen. I had reconstructive knee surgery at 18 years old and I was fully recovered in less then a year. He was always kind, but would tell you what you needed to do. He gave me many options and always told me to call anytime with questions. He even fit me in one day when I was paranoid about hitting me knee again. This is the only doctor I trust with my knee.  "
2382,39521,1.0,"Best Orthopedic doc on the planet.  He saved my knee from a nasty infection from a previous surgery, did half dozen more scopes over the years to my basketball thrashed joint, then gave me a new lease on my athletic aspirations with a total knee at age 45.  He's head and shoulders above his peers in his personal approach, personal touch, caring and nurturing nature.  Not just a fine doctor - but a fine human being, husband and father as well.  "
2383,39521,1.0,"Dr. Peterson is interested in helping each patient return to full, no-pain-health and activity.  He's an intelligent perfectionist, a kind, gentle, man who readily smiles and jokes with patients.  A person just feels good being in his presence! He's a doc who's &quot;there for you&quot;; he has said, &quot;Call me any time if you have a question of concern.&quot; His staff is excellent in that they are professional and caring.  "
2384,39522,2.0,"Waited two hours...unacceptable. If you value your time, go elsewhere.  "
2385,39523,0.0,"I usually don't write reviews, but this time I figured I would do it. I just had my 3rd visit with Dr. Pathy recently.  She is wonderful, smart and genuinely caring. It is hard to find good doctors these days, I have had several doctors in my life I feel I am in good hands now.  "
2386,39523,0.0,GREAT DR THAT REALY CARES.  I WOULD RECCOMEND YOU TO SEE HER 
2387,39524,1.0,My Fiance is stationed at Fort Lewis. Dr. Penavler was my sons doctor for the first month then Tricare told us that in order for him to be on Tricare Prime that he would have to be seen by an Army Doctor so we took our son to Mcchord Ped. When we took him to Mcchord the nurse put sliver nitrate on my sons belly button to remove the extra skin on it. Well she did it carelessly and gave my son 2nd degree burns. Need to say we never took our son back there again. . We took him back to Dr. Penavler We went to Tricare on base and told them what had happen at one of their clinics and filled out paper work to get his PCM change to Dr. Penavler. After they investigated what happen they approved my son to be seen by Dr. Penavler and for him still be enrolled in Tricare Prime. Dr Penavler is a AMAZING doctor that actually cares about your children. He called and checked on my son after work hours to tell us the result of a test.  How many doctors do you know that would do that&#63; His staff is great 
2388,39524,1.0,Best and most caring pediatrician you could hope to find for your child! 
2389,39524,1.0,"Absolutely amazing with children. Calming, soothing voice... has the God-given gift of putting children at ease. A very sweet man and highly recommended! "
2390,39524,1.0,Dr. Penalver has been great for all three of my children. He was also my husbands ped. Go Dr. Penalver! 
2391,39524,1.0,"I have known Dr. Penalver for years and did not hesitate to recommend him for my niece.  He has been her doctor for the past two years, since birth.  He truly cares.  "
2392,39524,1.0,"Dr. always takes as much time as I need to understand what is going on.  He is down to earth.  Very concerned about the welfare of my childrens health and emotional feelings.  Doesn't over medicate.  My kids are too old for a pediatrician now.  I wish I could find a G.P. in the area just like him.  If you are a Nervous Nelly and want a lot of tests and procedures to calm you, Dr. Penalver isn't for you.  If you like a more practical, personal, natural approach you will like him. "
2393,39524,1.0,"My son had been a patient from birth. At 18 months I brought up concerns about my son's hearing. I was sent home - again at 2 years I went to have my son's hearing checked - again sent home as an over concerned parent. At 2 years and 8 months I brought my son to a different doctor who ordered an EEG - ended with a diagnosis of Severe Bilateral Hearing Loss. Because I wasn't taken seriously, my son lost years of specialized services. The entire affair was disheartening as I really liked Dr. Penalver and his staff. "
2394,39524,1.0,"Very thoughtful, knowledgeable, and available. I've been looking a long time for a pediatrician I could trust and Dr. Penalver, along with his partners, have ended my search. "

I have a very difficult medical history, and Dr. Pederson has always been open to trying new things, and knows when to refer me to specialized help.  He always listens to me, and is never arrogant or opinionated.  The best in Whatcom county for sure!! "
2403,39529,1.0,Dr. Bruce M. Pederson of Birch Bay Family Medicine which is associated with Lynden Family Medicine is a very knowledgable and caring doctor.  
2404,39529,1.0,Dr.Pederson never seemed to know anything always left office more confused of situation then when I arrived. Issues were not addressed properly and my concerns were ignored. My health only got worse and I was forced to find another family Dr. 
2405,39530,1.0,He's nice when a parent is around. Kind of a jerk when they're not.  
2406,39530,1.0,"completely happy to spend the time necessary to ensure all needs were met.  Very friendly, patient, easy to speak with, and relate to.  My physicial since 2006, I am proud to call &quot;Jamie&quot; my doctor! "

2408,39530,1.0,Dr. Park is a very attentive Dr. He will refer when needed and goes out of his way to spend the time he needs in order to help you. His nurse is also a great part of his team. Been seeing him for several years.  
2409,39530,1.0,"EXCELLENT AVAILABILITY OF APPOINTMENTS, knowledgeable, personable, uses evidence based medicine.  Efficient in use of my resources as I am on a high deductible, consumer directed health plan "

2414,39533,0.0,Worst Doctor ever!! no professionalism. Was late by an hour but sent no email or call to let me know that. I went there waiting 30 minutes and then asked the staff who said she was running an hour late.  Please avoid her! 
2415,39534,1.0,"Incredibly rude and abrasive, especially since he works with children and concerned parents. I was amazed with how Dr.Paravecchio was unwilling to listen to me and didn't follow his staff's instructions either. He also was asking the children to put their hands in his pockets for prizes, which I found highly inappropriate. Ask to use a different anesthesiologist! "
2416,39535,1.0,"Dr. Peterson has been my family's G.P. for years at the Northgate Polyclinic. He has an excellent bedside manner and excellent staff (one person). My family's health ranges from special needs to healthy. He sees our newborns, foster children when we fostered, and my wife and I.  He is very personable, provides explanations, advice, and opinions.  He follows our health, follows up with hospitalizations, injuries, and procedures. From the other reviews it appears that he is not a doctor for those seeking prescriptions. This is true as he does not like to overmedicate (as modern as you can get) but will definitely prescribe you medication when necessary, as well as recommendations for PT and specialists for conditions or injuries. He provides checkups, vaccinations, minor in-office procedures, growth charts for our children, and will visit a hospital if needed. We've been through it all with him and I highly recommend him to anyone seeking a long-term family doctor. He cares.  "
2417,39535,1.0,Treats the whole family and we love him! Age birth to 30 active family that we are demands a lot from a physician and Dr. Peterson rises to the occasion each time! 
2418,39535,1.0,"Seemed very personable, but was not helpful to me and seemed very unfamiliar with current diabetes treatment (i.e. the last 20 years). When Dr. Peterson refused to consult a specialist for advice, I knew it was time to go elsewhere. I ended up having to travel 3000 miles to get a new prescription for a routine, life-sustaining medication. "
2419,39535,1.0,Didn't have much luck with this doctor as he seems to like to ascribe symptoms to idiopathic syndromes and is resistant to further investigation should the illness not be an easy diagnosis.  He seems to want to treat symptoms only and not get to the root cause of illness.  Seems to have a inordinate amount of belief in the placebo effect and won't continue medication even if you get better since he believes its due to the placebo effect and not the medication itself.  
2420,39536,1.0,"his dirty needle cost me a trip the the emergency room.  A month later, the crown he charged me 1,400 dollars for, fell out. "

2425,39540,1.0,"I've been a patient off and on for 10 years.  Haven't presented him with much challenges, but it's always been a great experience.  he seems fast, sharp, responsible.  my major complaint is that the office doesn't have email... that turns the simplest communication, like sending lab results or vaccination records back and forth, a pretty major hassle.  "
2426,39540,1.0,"I've been a patient for over 5 years.  I have never had a bad experience, never thought that he was anything but an fantastic doctor, and never felt that he didn't know what he was talking about.  He has a great manner, knows when to bring in other doctors, is prompt with his appointments, and has no issues ensuring you get an appointment in a timely manner when there is an urgent need.  Highly recommended.  "
2427,39540,1.0,"Everytime I've been to Dr. Pepin, I've found him extremely helpful, and has diagnosed what is going on. I received a referral from him that I didn't care for, but other than that, I'd highly recommend him! "
2428,39540,1.0,Ignores or overlooks causes of symptoms; rarely will place his own hands on patient.  Listens to concerns but seems to discount that information.  
2429,39540,1.0,Dr. Pepin has always been friendly and professional.  He has taken all of the time I need to answer questions and concerns.  He has always followed up as promised and made excellent referals as necesary.

2432,39542,1.0,"Have been with Dr. Peterson since I came to Seattle in 1979 & can very Highly Recommend him. He is extremely knowledgeable, knows what he is doing, explains to you in words that you understand & encourages you to ask questions. Most honest & sincere in all he does. Have brought 3 kind & myself to him. Refered to him when coming from Anchorage with a 14 year old son whom had been in a very bad motorcycle accident. Have recommeneded him to many other people.  "
2433,39543,1.0,Knows nothing about fibromyalgia or thyroid hormone resistance.  Does not listen to the patient.  Prefers to use old pharmaceutical company propaganda instead of newer science based protocols. Does not believe in the importance of vitamins.  Pays more attention to ink blots on paper then to the patients concerns.  
2434,39543,1.0,"Although Dr Palermo has a nice personality,he doesn't spend enough time with his patients. It is really hard to get an appointment with him in the afternoon. I've going to him for over 5 years and I've just wasted my time. His front desk staff are unprofessional and rude.  "
2435,39543,1.0,Dr Joseph Palermo and his staff are very knowledgeable and efficient. ARNP Susan Stone and Melinda Kloefer are supportive and very understanding of my wife's situation with Multiple Scherosis.  We highly recommend this doctor and Fifth Avenue Internal Medicine in Seattle.  
2436,39543,1.0,"He takes care of my diabetes and lungs, and can also manipulate my back! "
2437,39544,0.0,went to see her knowing i must be pregnant. she told me it was much more likely a urinary tract infection since there was no way i could detect i was pregnant so soon. she tested my urine and sent me home. a few days later an at home pregnancy test confirmed i was pregnant! I delivered a health baby boy 9 months later. 
2438,39544,0.0,"I was referred to Dr. Partoll by another Dr. and I fully expected to consult with her not a PA.  I was given, what I felt was an incomplete exam and then referred for a colonoscopy. That was fine but had nothing to do with the reason I had been referred to her for.  Did not go back.  "
2439,39544,0.0,"Dr. Partoll was my ob-gyn 10 years ago and was extremely knowledgeable, great bedside manner and diagnosed endometriosis which finally explained a lot of what I was going through.  She is one of my favorite doctors still.  "
2440,39544,0.0,"Regarding Dr. Linda Partoll:  I referred to Dr. Partoll by Dr. Hopkins for vaginal reconstructive surgery.  I have scar tissue from surgery and a big tear into the vaginal wall.  I hand delivered my paperwork to the front desk.  The receptionist was pleasant, but told me that doctors don't like to fix the mistakes of other doctors'.  Two weeks have passed since I was at the front desk and no one has contacted me.  Based on the reviews that I have read on ratemds.com - I think that I will start my search over again for a different Uro-Gynecologist.  Is she really the only Uro-Gyne withing 100 miles&#63;  Can someone give me a recommendation to another Uro-Gyne&#63; "
2441,39544,0.0,"Dr. Partoll is a cruel woman. She treated my wife like dirt in front of me. No telling how ignorant she was to her when I was not in the room. I thought that a female doc would understand the problems of a woman and have a greater compassion and caring for them than a male doc would. She is often late, way late like an hour, when she talks to you, she is condescending. She is a mean and hateful person, I would not refer anyone to her. For those of you out there with serious problems look up Dr. Miklos in Georgia. We went to see him, insurance covered the surgery. He took over 2 hrs wife my wife and I in exam and consult. This doc is wonderful.  "
2442,39544,0.0,"[History: My daughter(13) had been sick with an unknown illness for months that eventually led to a week hospital stay.] During this scary time and process, we were referred to Partoll and made an appointment. When the appointment finally came, we waited over 1 1/2 hrs past our appointment time, another 1/2 hr or more in the exam room ONLY for her to come in, talk for 3-5 mintues and send us on our way. NOTHING was dealt with, looked at, tested, treated.  3-4 months after this useless appointment is when she ended up in the hospital for the same illness. Could it have been avoided&#63; I will never refer this doctor to anyone I know. "
2443,39544,0.0,"I have been in pain for over a year nor did her surgery work. I am in worse condition after the surgery than before. Her staff is not the problem.Ater surgery,she sent me to the surgical floor with out an order for pain. I suffered in pain during the six week post op time.She now tells her staff to tell me to go to my PCP for the pain;I lay on my side everyday after work 2 to 3 hours to get out of pain (nearly one year later).I am payng thousands of dollars and have to find another doctor for the same problem.I want to know when someone is going to make doctors accountable for what they do or not do. I am very disappointed and sad about this bad experience;I wouldn't recommend her to anyone.I did a search on her and I wish I would of came across this rating site.I think she knows how much she hurts people and is unwilling to do anything about it. Passing the buck is easier.  "
2444,39544,0.0,"I'll let quotes from Dr. Partoll speak for themselvees: When I asked for my husband to try to speak on my behalf, she told him:&quot;I don't have time to talk to you. I've already wasted enough time on your wife.&quot; (I, myself, had waited naked on an exam table for her for 20 minutes before she even came in the room. I was supposed to be scheduled for surgery and she gave me about 15 minutes of her time--if THAT) When I tried to get her to listen to the physical problems that I had suffered from for 2 years that I needed surgery for (3 other doctors had said I needed the surgery, but it wasn't in their expertise, so they'd sent me to her) and I expressed my frustrations at having to endure 4 doctor's pelvic exams (I have painful internal scar tissue) She told me: &quot;I've had 8 other patients in my office this morning and none of THEM were crying.&quot; Nice, huh&#63; She's the ONLY Uro/Gyn within 100 miles of here so I guess she feels she's in power... "
2445,39545,0.0,"First off: I waited an HOUR to see her. She was running 20 minutes late on top of that! After the nurse took an additional 10 minutes entering in my information, the doctor came in 5 MORE minutes after that and talked to me for just 8! She then told me it was silly for my to be there and he wot help me and that I needed to see a psychiatrist if I want medication.  "
2446,39546,2.0,brett was very kind and helped me out right away. 
2447,39547,1.0,"Great doctor, took time to listen to my problem.  I felt at ease discussing issues with him.   Highly recommend! "
2448,39547,1.0,"You must be in alot of pain,,,  he gets to the nerves,,  then sends you home with instructions to record your pain..  He gives no pain medication.  Won't answer phone call..  Ignores patients in pain after procedures.  I find that the complete three appointments accomplished nothing but more misery.  Worst decision I made was to go there for help.  He wouldn't even come to the phone or prescribe medication for pain.   His nurse practioner prescribed pain meds that I was allergic to and she knew it and said &quot;You'll be alright&quot;..  That was at second appointment for assessment.  It takes over a month to get your first appointment,.  If your not in alot of pain you can't go to second procedure.  Then you wait another three weeks for another apt...  Then another two weeks for Nerve test..  and no pain relief.  Good Luck to anyone who would place their trust in him..  Its just not worth it.  "
2449,39548,0.0,This doctor was very rude and made me feel like I was worth nothing.  I left her office wanting to kill myself.  
2450,39549,2.0,I was satisfied w/my visit.  
2451,39550,1.0,"I have tried to see many other doctors in the past and even when I feel like not waiting the 2 to 3 hours to see Patterson. I have been misdiagnosed every time and still end up needing to see Dr Patterson in the end. He is a wonderful doctor who I hope stays around for a very long time. He is one of the few doctors who listens and actually works to pin point what the problem is. I have had the worst luck with other doctors in that office. Two misdiagnosed me so bad on 3 different occasions which sent me to the ER.  Dr Patterson is the only Dr I see now, ever! "
2452,39550,1.0,"For myself, Dr. Patterson sets the standard by which other family physicians may be measured.  In 1971, he returned to the U.S., following his graduation at U.B.C. and initial practice in North Vancouver.  After some years of dissatisfaction with other physicians, I found myself going to see him in Bellingham for my care.  Even though his services are not covered by my B.C. Medical, I'd incur the cost, any day.  Brian practices medicine as it should be practiced, without cutting corners, and with full and complete followup.  He is an excellent diagnostician.  He was one of those few who continued to do house calls long after many had ceased doing so during the 1970s, exhibiting much compassion.  I've been told that he had won the National Boards (in Canada).  The Bellingham, WA community is indeed fortunate to have him. "
2453,39550,1.0,"Awesome doctor with wonderful PA (physician assistant), Marge.  Marge specializes in women's medicine and is a Godsend.  My whole family sees her.  "

His staff is friendly &amp; helpful, and the clinic is nice inside.  I have referred several friends to Dr. Patron and would not hesitate to recommend him to anyone else.  "
2457,39554,0.0,"I have been treated for anxiety since I was 17.  I switched to Dr. Buckley almost 4 years ago.  I have only seen her in regards to refilling my anxiety medication twice, since I do not want or need to take them daily.  The last time was 14 months ago and the PX she gave me was for 20 pills.. when I went in to see her last week, since I was almost out, she told me that she does not believe anxiety should be handled with medication and advised I see a therapist, then told me to find a new dr.  Sounds like her personal opinion is interfering with my medical needs and care.  Considering she has never even bothered asking what causes it, referring me to a therapist was insulting. "
2458,39554,0.0,"I felt very relaxed and at ease with Dr. Buckley.  Even her medical assistant was very friendly and helpful.  I was not pleased with the doctor that I left to start seeing Dr. Buckley.  He did not listen to my concerns.  Dr. Buckley listened to my concerns, and addressed them.  I am naturally nervous at doctor appointments.  I did not feel this way at all.  She and her assistant put me at ease almost immediately.  I am sticking with Dr.  Peterson-Buckley! "
2459,39555,0.0,"Dr. Palacios is one of the best I've been to.  In the past I've had not so pleasant experiences, but her chairside manner is calming as she explains each procedure.Her work is EXCELLENT and thorough: matching the teeth color,and considering previous dental work.Takes care of patients comfort. Used Uniform Medical Insurance "
2460,39556,1.0,He was extremely caring and willing to just sit and listen. I had knee replacement and I fell once and he got me right in and took xrays and reassured me everything looked ok. He has alot of patience. I wouldn't go to anyone else again when it comes to my joint issues. A+++++++ 
2461,39556,1.0,He did surgery on my ankle and made an error; I lost all feeling in ankle. I called him back into my hospital room to tell him this and he just said that the bandages were too tight. He was in too much hurry to do another operation to pay attention to my problem.

2467,39559,1.0,"extremely unhelpful would not explain anything. While the visit was due to a &quot;Swine flu&quot; scare did not inquire re: symptoms or other medical issues, which were present at the time. No physical examination. 10 yr. old thought Dr.  was &quot;a jerk&quot; "
2468,39559,1.0,"The office staff are rude, they are unorganized and never call you back. On several occasions we have called to talk to a nurse and either never got a call back or on the rare case that we did it was 2 days later. Also the staff do not know how to complete referrals so good luck getting anywhere even if you do manage to get the Dr to give you one. As a parent when you ask a serious question about your child welfare you would expect to be taken seriously but the Dr exhibits an attitude like you should know this what are you stupid&#63; And any issue that comes up is just normal they will grow out of it. Perhaps that fact that my child experienced multiple A.L.T.E. and the Dr just shrugged it off made me loose faith in him. I contacted a specialist myself and found that my child did have problems that should have been addressed immediately and Dr Pattillo couldn't seem to care less.        Remember there is no substitute for a mothers intuition.      We are currently seeking a new ped. "
2469,39560,1.0,Have been to see him for many years.  My son and husband have both been to see him too.  He is always kind and takes lots of time to answer all of your questions and concerns.  I would recommend him.

He's been treating me for a month now. He is a very knowledgeable doctor and I would recommend him to anyone.  "
2473,39562,1.0,Dr. Parsons is probably one of the best doctors in the Whitman County area. I would recommend him to anyone. He's very good at what he does and he actually takes the time to really find out what the problem is. 
2474,39563,0.0,"She really needs to work on her bedside manner--she's been kind of short with me, and actually rude. She was my doctor for three years, but I'm going to be making a switch.  "
2475,39563,0.0,"Dr. Petcoff came highly recommended.  I think she is a good doctor but needs to work on her bedside manner and her billing practices.

I love her personality and sense of humor. "

What I like best about her is that she doesn't give you that &quot;why are you here&quot; face when you go in for a yearly physical/checkup.  In fact, it is through my yearly physical that she discovered I had a major medical problem (I'm young, healthy, and had no signs or symptoms). She ordered a series of tests and scans and even called all the providers to get me in that same day. I was impressed she didn't just hand this duty off to a nurse.  She recommended good surgeons and made sure I had the best medical care.  I'm okay now and it's all because Dr. Pearson knowledge and attitude toward physicals/yearly checkups.  "

He spoke about that for about 10 mins then asked to see my tongue, said it wasn't swollen therefore,there was no allergic reaction, and that &quot;it is all in my head&quot;, and then advised me to CONTINUE the medication.  I felt as if I was trying to breathe though a straw, I was having pain EVERYWHERE, my tongue and lips were numb and tingling along with mood changes and itching that I was having, I also had Migranes.  None of this counted as an &quot;allergic reaction&quot; however on the paper work he sent me home with, it stated that if I had any Numbness, trouble breathing, itching, soreness, or tingling in the hands or feet, to come back to the ER.

2508,39588,1.0,"I was referred to Dr. Gordan who was retiring therefore I was given to the man purchasing his practice Dr. Jason Pehling.  He misdiagnosed me as a locker when in fact my jaw was catching and clicking from bit misalignment and clenching.  He made a splint so thick it degenerated my jaw joints rapidly within 24 months. Since I was a clencher, he should have made me a thin splint.  He also did not take into consideration the current stress in my life.  Every other professor doctor I have talked to would never start with a 10mm thick splint. Now I am damaged for life and there is nothing I can do about it since the TMJ is such a hard thing to deal with.  Some thing work and some things don't.  Definitely get a second opinion before you let his guy do anything and never let him start with a thick splint.  He and his staff are very arrogant.  He is supposed to be one of the best in our area and I would beg differ. "
2509,39588,1.0,"Dr. Pehling is a wonderful dentist, but he needs to consider the treatment his staff gives to patients. I have been seen in the office twice and I will never go back. Debra, the office manager is incredibly rude and has, in my experience, a sense of entitlement that is offensive. Good luck to Dr. Pehling, the overall rating alludes to the experience by that staff as less than satisfactory.  "
2510,39588,1.0,He is a fine doctor with a reputation of extinct character.  He reflects what all doctors should wish for as he tries to place the patient first at all times and has been rated by top dentist twice recently.  The staff is outstanding and what reflects what TMJ patients should reflect.  THANK YOU DR. PEHLING 
2511,39589,1.0,"Dr. Page is the best. There really is no one better! He is a leading electrophysiologist and cardiologist. He is pure genius and has authored and published MANY articles on heart conditions. He has a way of making people feel better about themselves and their conditions, without lying to you or sugar-coating the truth. He is non-judgemental and appreciates all people... regardless of their weight, age, sex, culture, etc... His clinic is always busy and you better keep your appointments though.. it is sometimes tough to be seen when you want, but once you get an appointment.. KEEP IT! His front desk staff is HIGHLY organized and professional, yet they could be a little more empathetic and personable. "
2512,39590,1.0,"Our family has been with him for about 15 years...what can I say...personal, caring, always there for us.  He has taken great care of our children. I will never go anywhere else. "
2513,39590,1.0,"Not only is he always cheerful and obviously  loves his job and the kids he treats, he is by far one of the most intelligent people I have ever met, and that includes the professors at the colleges I attended.  He is thorough, patient and I credit him with saving the life of my youngest child.  He actually listens to the parents and doesn't blow off their even tiniest concerns.  He even called me from his own home to check on my baby when she was sick.  He speaks to me with words that I, a non-Latin-speaking everyday person who didn't go to med school can understand, but also doesn't talk down to me, nor my children.  He was a foster parent as well as a Mary Bridge oncall doc and I dread the day he retires!  I recommend him to everyone and trust him with the lives of all 4 of my kids 100%.   You won't find a better pediatrition anywhere!!!! "
2514,39590,1.0,Spends as much time as needed with patients and parents. Asks lots of questions and encourages you to ask questions. My twins like him and run to hug him at every appt. His staff have been with him a very long time and I think that says something about him not only as a doctor but as a person. He is straight forward in his approach and I appreciate that.  
2515,39591,1.0,"dr. parisot is extremely thorough.  i was very impressed with his grasp of my lengthy and complex medical history.  40 minutes was scheduled for my appointment, but he spent 75 minutes with me. he did NOT seem rushed.  he is a listener, which is so rare these days.  he is my new primary doctor, after 4 other tries (and unpleasant experiences) in the past few years.  "
2516,39592,1.0,Knowledgable and caring. He has helped me with cervical and lumbar back problems.

2518,39594,1.0,"had arm and shoulder pain and numbnesss.  needed c-5 and c-6 disk and bone spurs removed and replaced with a donor bone.  After the surgery I noticed the pain in my arm was completely gone.  The surgery made me sore, mostly muscle tightness, that lasted a couple weeks.  It is now 4 weeks later and I feel great.  Still need to take it easy, avoid heavy lifting and jarring activies but Dr. Pearce did a great job! "
2519,39594,1.0,"Wow, this was a crazy experience. I was sent to this doctor due to arm pain. (Bone growth in my neck causing arm pain-herniated disc too but that was not the cause of the pain.) It was recommended that I have a fusion surgery along with a plastic 'absorbable' plate to hold the fusion together until the bone fused.  I was told that the plate would absorb in 6-8 weeks.  LIES.  After terrible complications - a deviated esophagus, requirement to stay on a liquid diet, severe weight loss, a second and third surgery, constant throat pain, voice changes, etc, I found out the plate takes YEARS to disolve. These were not the risks I was told about! The plate 'bent' after another vertebre cracked during surgery and I have yet to recover. Be careful when considering SPINE SURGERY! If he had even apologized or offered to help...  Instead, in his office notes he states &quot;XXXX returns AGAIN&quot; I ultimatly had to find a new doctor. "

2521,39596,0.0,"Under the care of D. Paley I felt looked-after and like I was recieving quality treatment. The staff was also very friendly and understanding. I trust Dr. Paley with my life, and anyone with ovarian cancer should too. "

2523,39596,0.0,"I found out I was BRCA2 +. I was 53 and was concerned about my ovarian cancer risk. I went to Dr. Paley because of her credentials in Hereditary Breast and Ovarian cancer. I came to her expecting to remove my ovaries and tubes. However, she recommended I have a full hysterectomy because of &quot;residual fallopian tube tissue&quot; which would leave about a 10% remaining risk of ovarian cancer. I consented to a total hysterectomy. I asked if I could keep my cervix and she abruptly said NO....My staff and I call it the Clean sweep, we take out everything...It did not feel right but I was scared and mentally weak (I had just been diagnosed with Breast Cancer). I later found out the risk from residual fallopian tube tissue is NEGLIGIBLE....I now have painful sex and I hope it gets better, but the sad thing is, I gained nothing and lost alot. I would approach Dr. Pam Paley with extreme caution. Do Not let her talk you into a total hysterectomy for BRCA risk reduction. "
2524,39596,0.0,Dr Paley and her staff were awesome. I highly recommend her!!! 
2525,39596,0.0,I went to this doctor 6 different times over the period of 2 months.  I took multiple tests and she was unable to come up with a solution to treat all of my symptoms.  She was very disrespectful and tried to downplay the amount of pain I was in.  I've had cancer four times so I really don't exaggerate when there is a problem.  I am now searching for a new doctor to try to help me.  I still have unresolved issues. 
2526,39597,1.0,"Best body plastic surgeon! So professional, and relate able. Easy to talk to and trust. I would recommend him to anyone! "
2527,39598,0.0,"She treats my daughter and has created a fractured family.  My minor daughter no longer speaks to me or her sister, calling us socialpaths and psychopaths.  I have statements that Ms. Paulsen has destroyed our family and has no interest in reintegrating it.  I believe that she has implanted false memories to support her books on DID and does not care about the mental state of her patients at all. "
2528,39600,1.0,Dr Peterson and his staff are down to Earth and are a very cool bunch. They have in house lab and X-ray. A podiatrist also comes out weekly. 
2529,39601,1.0,"I was a Pait. that was a BAd Sugery. No Ansewers For me. I lost most of the control in my leg, ( siatic nerve) From a sugery.

So To this day I really dont know what happen.  many years have gone by from this sugery, I deal with Chroinc Pain everyday in my leg, witch leads to depression. "
2530,39602,1.0,"Jeff was our doctor in Lewiston.  We loved his knowledge and personality. He is prompt, thoughtful and helpful.  We were VERY sad when he left Lewiston, so now I am recommending him to my family in Spokane. "
2531,39602,1.0,"My Dr. of 23 years retired was replaced by Dr. Pedersen. My first impression of him was not a good one. First, he walked in without knocking on the door. I found this to be extremely rude. Not only that but he introduced himself as &quot;Jeff.&quot; I am more comfortable with doctors who like to be called by doctor. Finally, he told me and my parents that my doctor was forced out of the practice. This I know not to be true. Unfortunately, this means I will not be returning to the office that I have been receiving treatment from since I was two.  "
2532,39603,0.0,"Dr. Park was gentle, patient and assuring when I had fear over procedures. By far the best dentist in that regard I have experienced in the entirety of my lives dental care. He was informative and intently listened. I find Dr.Park to be very honest and upfront. The staff is great...Jeniffer is the only asst. I have worked with directly. She she is very personable, very courteous and very efficient in her work.  She personally plays a large key part in my overall positive thoughts about the office. Between the quality of care and the by far reasonable and competitive prices I have received thus far a cleaning, xrays,and 5 fillings, contouring and fast braces. To which I am amazed at the results. I am always helped within minutes of arriving and scheduling is always great. If I call with questions I am always helped in a timely manner. I travel well over an hour to visit my favorite office and am happy to do so...  Trista "
2533,39604,1.0,"The worst experience I have ever had with a doctor! He was incredibly rude, arrogant and deliberately insulting. He let me know that he thought I was wasting his time, and asked, &quot;WHAT are you doing here&#63;&quot; (I had been referred by my doctor) But he had the gall to say &quot;It really doesn't matter to me - I'm getting paid regardless.&quot; His demeanor was cold, hateful and unprofessional, and he seemed to delight in insulting me. Avoid this guy!!! "
2534,39605,1.0,"Dr. Perala is a very good dentist, and he's extremely knowledgeable. I had a great experience when I needed several implants done. I would definitely recommended him. "
2535,39605,1.0,"He comes off as a really great guy, but he work he did on me is less than shoddy.   If I could turn back the clock, he would of never worked on me.  The guy did implants in infected jaw bone, somehow he didn't notice when he put the implants in and he said it was &quot;easy, like cutting into butter&quot;. I have permanent trigeminal nerve damage in my jaw post his surgery, 10 surgeries later (from somewhere else much better but I had to travel) I still have osteomyelits that he most likely contributed to if not outright caused the acute osteomyelitis episode.  When I originally told him of my concerns of infection and was confirmed with medical imaging as osteomyelitis, he told me its just a fantasy&quot;. I should of sued at the time, but I was so ill for so long  from the infection I didn't have the energy or the money.  I have since heard folks in the dental profession call wendell dental the Mcdonalds of dentistry...fitting! my recomendation is run from this dentist and this office.  "
2536,39606,1.0,"Dr. Pelton is a jewel.  From beginning to end, he treated me with respect, and explained every detail of my treatment.  Each visit found him lighthearted, making it a personal, comfortable and pleasant experience. I can't imagine having a better oncologist.  Whoever wrote the negative review must not have been seeing the same doctor I was. I would recommend him to anyone.  "
2537,39606,1.0,Spent a lot of time explaining the procedure.  Knowledgeable and helpful 
2538,39606,1.0,.

2540,39607,1.0,"This is one of the nicest doc's i've ever come across. Not only did he help me, he gave my money back because &quot;he didn't want to be part of the system that was screwing me&quot;. "

2545,39610,2.0,"Great bedside manner, explained things very well. "
2546,39610,2.0,too much waiting time and the least time spent with doctor. 
2547,39611,1.0,This doctor does not listen and is only interested in moving people thru the process. He gave me an endoscopy and didn't really even say hi before he knocked me out.  
2548,39612,1.0,Dr. Parrish is very thorough and takes his time with his patients. He is trustworthy; I have been his patient for 10 years. I even recommended him to my mother. Very pleased with his care. 
2549,39615,1.0," Extremely rude and the worst bed side manner ive ever seen. my mother has been vomiting and in intense pain for weeks. dr barclay not only told her that there was nothing wrong with her, but he made her feel so inferior that she was visibly upset. Shame on you dr barclay, the patients that go to these facilities are the ones that assure you a pay check. I would love to see your press ganey scores and i cannot wait to get the survey in the mail. "
2550,39615,1.0, I had just seen this Doctor at Mon General Hospital.He makes you feel there is nothing wrong with you and his comments makes you feel where you just want to give up on life.Yes I feel that away right now.All because your test don't show the pain.He makes you feels like your crazy in the head.  
2551,39615,1.0, he runs on time! 
2552,39615,1.0, he is an excellent compassionate doctor 
2553,39615,1.0," This doctor did not look at me while talking with me, and made bizaare comments when I tried to discuss my history of depression with him. I was very uncomfortable with him, and soon found a much more compassionate physician. "
2554,39618,0.0," We started going to Dr. Bailey about 2 years ago and at first everything was fine.  But for the past 6-8 months everything has gone down hill to the point we are considering looking for another Doctor. When you make an appointment you wait forever before you are seen, and then you are seen for maybe 10 mins. She has never taken lab work on my husband and I in the 2 years we have been going. I have also called and in the past had no problem with staff but whoever works front desk now needs a serious attitude adjustment. She is a complete witch! We do have insurance and work very hard and wish our doctor cared as well. "
2555,39618,0.0," VERY unhappy with this dr!  She does not spend much time w/ you & is a very awkward person to talk to. I do not feel that she is that knowledgeable or helpful. The most frustrating part is that it is IMPOSSIBLE to talk to anyone on the phone when calling the office. Your only option is to leave a message. I have never had them return a call the same day & most of the time have to call 2 or 3 times to get anyone to call back. Staff is VERY RUDE! It's hard to feel that your doctor cares about your healthcare when it takes so much effort just to have a phone call returned. Took over 3 months to get a referral made. Have had problems w/ the billing dept. too. On more than 1 occasion the excuse of a staff member being sick has been used to explain why there is no punctuality. I feel that is a poor reason to ignore patients needs. Also, took more than a week to get a RX approved by her for insurance needs. She was not bothered that I was off my meds for over a week when I asked her about it.  "
2556,39618,0.0, Great doctor. Actually took the time to listen to me and answer my questions. Explained different options to me and supported my decision. 
2557,39618,0.0," Dr. Bailey is in & out & spends very little time with you. You spend more time waiting than actual time with her. Not very sociable. Office staff is rude & do not expect to ever talk to a human being when you call. Always have to leave a message for an appointment, etc. & hope that they return the call within the next 48hrs.  "
2558,39627,0.0, Dr. Barber is a great dentist in Morgantown. She and her staff are extremely  friendly and knowledgeable and answered any questions I had regarding my treatment.  I am unsure about the previous negative reviews because this was not my experience at all. 
2559,39627,0.0," She has an attitude and is very rude.Her and some of her assistants stood in a circle out in hall talking quietly and I got the impression it was about me. This happened more than once. Made me feel stupid when I asked questions.  When I expressed my concerns about amalgam fillings and mercury, she actually put an ad out in the paper as to how safe these fillings are. "
2560,39627,0.0," This was the worst experience that I have ever had at a dentist office. First, I was told that the appointment for a new patient would be $218.00 and I get there and was told that it was $318.00 and that just included a cleaning and X-rays. The X-ray tech cut the roof of my mouth and under my tongue and it was sore for days. She seemed like she did not even want to be there. The dental hygenist cleaned my teeth and was very nice, but it seemed that my teeth were not even clean when she finished. The dentist came in for about 3 minutes and was very rude, just her whole attitude and the way that i was treated. I was told that I needed so much work done on my teeth by this dentist and I went to get a second opinion and the only thing that I needed was two fillings. I would not recommend this place at all!! "
2561,39627,0.0," This doctor was very rude, inconsiderate, and unknowledgible. "
2562,39629,2.0," I was unable to make it to a STAT CT Scan because I could not drive, or find a ride. I called in the next day to explain this to Dr. Bailey, so that it could be re-scheduled. Instead, I was mailed a notice of termination as a patient. I had to find another doctor to go to in my area. "
2563,39642,2.0," Dr. Ballester was my oncologist at Cancer Treatment Centers of America in Zion, IL from 1997-1999.  I had two stem cell transplants and the man is brilliant and truly gave me back my life.  Thank you. "
2564,39645,1.0, Dr. Bandak is extremely helpful and knowledgeable in his field of practice. He made me feel very comfortable in his office. He was highly professional and kind. I would recommend him to anyone i meet needing a plastic surgeon.  
2565,39645,1.0, I lost 80lbs and Dr. Bandak performed abdominoplasty on me.  He is a wonderful doctor.  My surgery turned out great.  I look better now then when I was in my twenties.  He and his staff were both kind and professional.  I am so glad I had him do my surgery.  I would recommend him to my friends and family in a heart beat.  
2566,39645,1.0," Dr Bandak is great. The staff is great. Very courteous and pleasant. He explained everything very well. The only negative is the wife/manager. She can be intrusive and seems pushy, but I love the doctor! "
2567,39645,1.0, Dr Bandak is the only doctor for me.  He really cares about you and if you are happy with his work. 
2568,39645,1.0, I really like Dr Bandakl.  He is very pleasant and willing to answer all questions.  He makes sure that he gives you his cell phone number.  Everything didn't go perfect and I had to have additional surgery.  I ended up in the hospital for 3 weeks.  He went out of town for 3 days and he made arrangements for his nurse to come in to change my dressing.   His wife and office staff are fantastic too' 
2569,39645,1.0, i was verry happy with what he did i tell every one about him!i tell them that he is the best surgeon to go to him !!!i would like to have more stuff dune like my leggs and arms but maybe later.but if i would rate him you cant cause theres not enought numbers he is the beast!!!!! 
2570,39645,1.0, He explained everything I needed for my procedure to put me at ease prior to my surgery.  
2571,39645,1.0," Excellent phsyician, kind, great staff at the JW office. "
2572,39649,1.0, He gave up on me and another dr. In a completely unrelated specialty found my problem 
2573,39649,1.0, Smart Doc.  Very flexible and helpful with my needs. 
2574,39649,1.0, Great doctor. Been seeing him a couple years. Taking my new born daughter to him tomorrow. Great location as well if you're like me and hate down town charleston and big hospitals with terrible parking.  
2575,39649,1.0,.  great location near the airport plenty of free parking 
2576,39652,0.0,.  They tried to get me to pay over 3000 more than the insurance would pay! Very rough with patients I thought 
2577,39652,0.0," She told me that I had 13 cavities!!  Also, she sent me for a root canal, but when I got to the endodontist, they said there was no need for a root canal.  Despite that, I went back to get a cavity filled.  She put her instruments on my neck while she worked on my tooth.  I told her that I was not numb, twice, yet she continued to work until I made her stop.   Her staff are friendly, but worst dental experience of my life!! "
2578,39652,0.0, I am 53 years old and am in the beginning stages of Invisilign.  Dr. Bailey and her staff have been the most caring professionals I have ever experienced. Several years ago she removed all the &quot;silver&quot; from my mouth and replaced a crown that another dentist had messed up. I would hope that she will be my grandchildren's dentist because of her attention to appointment time (no waiting) and her extreme gentleness. I look forward to going to the dentist! 
2579,39652,0.0," I paid $1,747.00 for a root canal, core buildup and crown for tooth(#13). It was fractured during root canal and the crown was applied anyway.  The tooth was sensitive to the touch and was unable to eat on it.  An infection occured around the tooth and had to be extracted at another $205.00 by an oral surgeon.  The dentist talked all the while she was working on me and I wondered then how she could work and talk so much at the same time.  NOT VERY WELL OBVIOUSLY.  I chose this dentist because she is supposed to be very well trained and a smile artist and sure charges according to that reputation.  I can honestly say that my smile is not a nice as it was before I went to her.  She charges so much that she only has to work 3 days a week.  TUE, WED AND THURSDAY.  If you don't want you smile messed up look further for a dentist. "
2580,39656,1.0," Dr. Ballas is a wonderful physician and human being.  He is kind, considerate, and has a great personality.  He has a way of making you so at ease, which is not easy with this kind of specialty.  I always hated gynecology appointments, but Dr. Ballas makes it so much easier.  He is very thorough, gentle, and so knowledgeable. The first time I ever met him, was in the operating room ready to have a DNC because I was miscarrying.  My regular OB/GYN was on vacation, and thankfully Dr. Ballas was on call.  He made a point of coming into the holding area before I went in the OR, and held my hand and told me not to worry that he was going to take good care of me, and expressed how sorry he was that I had to go through this again (I had also miscarried my first baby). He was so good with my husband as well, assuring him it would all work out. I switched gynecologists soon after.  I have been a patient of Dr. Ballas for 5 years now, and I think the world of him.  He is the best =) "
2581,39658,1.0, Excellent doctor with great bedside manners and knowledge. He explains everything in a way that anybody understands.  
2582,39665,2.0, Excellent experience with a wonderful doctor. Dr.  Bailey was very helpful in answering all my questions and my daughter had an awesome experience! 
2583,39667,1.0, One of the best eye exams I have ever had.  He is a very thorough examiner. I would recommend him to anyone having problems with their eyes. 
2584,39673,0.0, Excellent in balancing treatment-resistive condition combined with reproductive issues. I wish I had found her sooner. 
2585,39674,1.0, A very caring Doctor. You might have to wait in the waiting but he takes his time with all patients.  
2586,39683,1.0,.  This Doctor does not what he's doing IN my MMI he said I had bulging l1-l2  l2-l3  l5-s1 and that AP lumbar spin shows diffuse degene er ative changes with narrowing at l5-s1 but then my diagonsis is a lumbar strain and a right hip strain and I could back full dutys has CNA 
2587,39683,1.0," Worker's comp set this app't up for an IME. My husband has multiple herniated dics and 1 bulging disc at his tale bone (according to his MRI). He is in alot of pain and can't stand or sit for very long at a time. Neurosurgeon put him below sendentary and told him he could not return to his regular job as a truck driver. After seeing Dr. Bachwitt, his report stated he could go back to full duty with no restrictions and that his injury was just a pulled muscle. My husband has worked his whole life and only missed 3 days of work in 25 years and workers comp and this &quot;so called doctor&quot; treated him like trash. He has been trying to get some relief since Nov of 2011. So in order to get him some help we are now going to use our own health insurance. I would NOT recommend this doctor to anyone even if he offered his services for free..  "
2588,39683,1.0,.  This Doctor has no clue what is going on!and should not be a Docter!

2591,39683,1.0, I don't know why I was sent to this doctor for a back injury but he is a very poor doctor. Never hardly spoke a word to me other than to tell me how to move and what way. Then he reports back to my workers comp claim that I am able to return to work with full duties with 2 herniated disc and a buldging disc. What us awrong with these doctors today&#63;&#63;&#63; Nurse was nice other than that I wouldn't send my dog to him. sorry I feel that way but when someone can't even walk or have intercourse with their husband due to a bcak injury and they act like there is nothing awrong. I've worked all my life and get treated like trash. I hope that if you read this and you are scheduled and appt. with him that yu change your mind. The Receptionist was very nice also. Think about it. I'm in pain every single day of my life and I get this kind of treatment from a doctor. And he isn't even a neuro doctor either.

2594,39683,1.0," I saw Dr. Bachwitt for a cyst on my wrist. At the time, I had a newborn baby, so lifting him was causing pain.  My husband went with me to the appt.  After Dr. Bachwitt examined my wrist and we discussed surgical removal of the cyst, he told me how I could take a book or hard object and slam it on the cyst to bust it and that my body would just absorb the fluid.  I left his office not knowing what to think. Neither did my husband.  So, I decided not to do anything or go to any other doctors and fortunately the pain subsided, although I still have the cyst. "
2595,39683,1.0," Verizon made my husband go to this Doctor. There were at least 3 other Doctors that advised my husband he needed surgery. This Doctor told my husband to his face that he agreed with a lot of what the other doctors said,that he needed to be off work to go through physical therapy and to a pain clinic. Then he turned around and advised Verizon that my husband did not have anything wrong with him and advised him to return to work. Because of this, my husband lost his job,benefits, retirement and a lot of faith in getting help. He has since found a REAL Doctor Josiah K Lilly that has helped giving him injections and pain medication he desperately needed as well as referring him to a surgeon in Florida to get surgery.  NO THANKS TO THIS SO CALLED DR Bachwitt and VERIZON! "
2596,39689,1.0, Dr Bal did my ACL reconstruction and he was awesome. I'm now a year out and running 5 days a week with very few issues. Follow his directions and don't try to rush anything before he gives you the green light. I'd recommend him highly.  
2597,39689,1.0, Dr. Bal conducted ACI surgery on my right knee - a cutting edge surgery that most drs in WV have never even heard of.  He is a professional and capable Dr. and I would use him again. 
2598,39689,1.0," What can I say, what ever it is it isn’t enough …..He is a great DR .He knows what he is doing. I had three major surgeries in one on my right shoulder...I thought I was doing great then another issue not related to my shoulder happened. Following the other Dr.’s  orders I didn’t realize I was damaging my shoulder. In rides …..Dr. Bal to again repair the damage. I’ts painful and discouraging, and frankly I’ve had enough of the shoulder issue. But if he won’t give up, neither will I...  "
2599,39689,1.0, Great bedside mannor! He treats you as if you are his onlt patient.  
2600,39689,1.0," I was in a bad ski accident and had to have two reconstructive surgeries one on each knee and also ankle surgery for broken bones. I love Dr. Bal! I have been his patient for 8 monthes and he is the most caring doctor I have met. He has helped me go from not walking at all, starting to walk again, and now recovering still. He is the  best and I would recommend him to anyone and everyone! "
2601,39689,1.0," Awesome!!!I have not met a doctor like this ever!  My husband had been injured at work with a bicep tendon tear at the elbow.  Dr. Bal met with us for a consult and then surgery to follow in two days.  Dr. Bal was very busy but made every effort to fit us into his schedule because of the serious/urgency of this type of injury.  He was very polite, informative and concerned.  There were even two different times that Dr. Bal himself came in and apoligized to us himself about the wait.  You see he really did squeeze us in that day.  Very nice, caring, professional, detail oriented doctor.  The surgery went great, no problems.  I would recommend anyone to Dr. Bal.  He's the type of doctor that reminds you of the love and desire someone going into this field has at the beginning of their career.  But yet he carries this attitude with him after numerous years in his profession.  You don't find many if any doctors like this anymore.  You are treated as an individual not just a number.  A-#1 "
2602,39690,1.0," Dr. Bali is a wonderful surgeon.  He is the best around, no doubt! "
2603,39691,1.0, Dr Bailey is the best dentist I have ever been too. The staff is extremely helpful and nice. Wait time is minimal. Dr. Bailey is very knowledgeable in his procedures and you don't feel he is doing any unnecessary work just for the money. Dr. Bailey has a wonderful bed side manner and treats you with respect. His whole staff is very knowledgeable of their jobs. I have never had a bad appointment while seeing Dr. Bailey and his staff. I have been a patient there for around 10 years. 
2604,39692,2.0, calls off all the time never there . rude..... would never go back 
2605,39695,1.0," His staff is rude and unhelpful. He himself is so sweet and very caring, but since you see his staff more often, the whole experience is unpleasent. "

2610,39698,0.0," Tammy is so very professional yet extremely personable. I feel like she genuinely cares for my well-being. She takes my concerns seriously but doesn't overreact with tons of unnecessary tests and medicines. She informs me of all available choices for my treatments, makes recommendations and then we decide together. She belongs in a better facility with better staff. "
2611,39698,0.0, Tammy is the best doctor for females I have ever had.  Love her.  
2612,39702,1.0," Does not do many surgeries any longer.  A shame.  He was a good surgeon.  Overall, as a family practice guy, one of the best I've ever seen. "
2613,39702,1.0, good surgeon and general practicioner 
2614,39706,1.0, Very Knowledgeable.  Best prescription I ever had. Knows what he is doing and does it well.  I can see! does anyone know his phone # so I can get another Appt.&#63; Paid/Co-pay:$50
2615,39706,1.0, UNFRIENDLY STAFF MEMBERS AND DOCTOR WAS DISRESPECTFUL! MY FAMILY AND I WILL NOT BE RETURING TO SEE THIS DOCTOR AGAIN. HE DOES NOT TAKE ANY INSURANCES AND IS RUDE.  I WAS VERY UNHAPPY WITH THE SERVICE I RECEIVED! 
2616,39707,2.0, Always listens and addresses the problem. Never any unecessary test. 
2617,39710,0.0,i had her paged for my child on thursday night and on monday still never heard anything been week later and still nothing it just don't say a lot for a doctor when they do that with a sick child..and well you neverr know when her office is open or closed cause you can never reach anyone in there either...  
2618,39710,0.0,"VERY BAD DOCTOR ON EVERY LEVEL!!!  She doesn't like you to take your children to the hospital, even during emergencies.  Seems to want everything secretive so nobody finds out her plans of pt. management or lack thereof. "
2619,39710,0.0,"I ask her what the difference was between swine flu and the seasonal flu, and she was very rude.  She raised her voice at me and said stop calling it the swine flu, don't call it that no more.  And then she went on and said that it was the same as the seasonal flu that there was not a difference in them.  I contiuned to ask her questions and with ever response to my question she was rude and not helpful at all.  She talked down to me like my concerns for my kids was not important. I don't think she has very good bedside manners at all.  Every other Dr. I have ever been to has answered my questions with alot of detail and concern. I have also noticed that she acts like she is in a hurry to get you out of her office like she doesn't have the time. My opinnion if you go into the medical field especially dealing with litte childern than you should at least enjoy childern and your job.  Dr. Cabes attuide makes me feel like she doesn't enjoy either of them.  "
2620,39710,0.0,you can get an appointment whether she keeps your appointment is the problem my girls have had three    appointments that she has rescheduled my4 month olddaughter has seen her at all i schudeled an appointment for her when she 2 months old dr cabe has resheduled all of them for some reason or another 
2621,39711,0.0,Helped me extremely well with my anxiety. Found a solution for me within a few months.  
2622,39711,0.0,Very Conscientious.  Up-to-date info. Treats each patient as if he or she is only one. 
2623,39712,1.0,"Doctor did not listen. After giving me a medication that was too expensive, pharmacist attempted to contact doctor to order something more affordable. Doctor immediately accused me of med seeking, though the medications were in no way controlled substances. He then sent me a certified letter telling me he could no longer see me.  "
2624,39713,0.0,"Dr. Coleman is very cold. When I explained to her my periods were coming early she told me I was incorrectly taking my birth control. I told her I'd been on the pill for years, and knew how to take it, but this particular brand was causing me trouble, and sickness. Her staff is kind, helpful and amazing all around. They are usually the ones who call in my prescriptions and they are the ones who called the pharmacy to tell them to change my brand. When I inquired as to a different type of birth control Dr. Coleman told me I could only take &quot;the ring or the pill&quot; I asked about two other types, and asked why she refused to even discuss them and she only repeated &quot;the ring or the pill.&quot; No reasons given. She's also never on time. Always prepare to wait for your appointment. Once you're in, it's over in minutes. She's very crass, and I don't care for her bedside manner or lack of explanations. I am currently in search of another doctor. 3 routine visits with her is enough.  "
2625,39713,0.0,"Dr. Coleman was on call when I went to the ER w/a 8cm ovarian cyst- the worst pain of my life!  Despite knowing this, she refused to come in to look at me and wanted me to wait overnight until she felt like coming in, in the morning.  I couldn't stand the pain, so I insisted to the ER Dr. that she transfer me to Pittsburgh, where they immediately (4 am) did surgery because they were so worried about the effects of the cyst, and the risk that it posed to my unborn child.  Knowing the same set of facts, Dr. Coleman could not be bothered to come in or act with any urgency (like sending me to Pittsburgh earlier).  If it was up to her, I might have lost my ovary and my baby.  The pain was so bad that I was bowled over in pain even with 3 doses of morphine.  So I don't know what Dr. C is like in person, but she doesn't seem like a terribly dedicated or knowledgeable physician.  "

2627,39715,2.0, 
2628,39716,1.0,Dr.Cassim has an arrogant attitude and a difficult accent to understand. He was very unhelpful and would not explain anything. I did not get the impression that he knew much.  would not recommend him 
2629,39716,1.0,"Dr. Cassim recommended that I receive an ileostomy (bag) stating that it was the &quot;gold standard&quot;. This was also the recommendation of the GI doctor, John Shammaa. I consulted Cleveland Clinic and learned this to be untrue and had a laproscropic assist, total abdominal colectomy with illeorectal anastamosis (removal of large intestine only) performed w/no issues by Dr. Dougherty out of Fairfax, VA. Dr. Cassim also relayed a story of a situation in which a patient requested to go with the procedure to avoid the bag and during the operation, Dr. Cassim gave him the bag against his wishes because Cassim decided the patient wouldn't follow up with exams properly. This type of god-playing scared me away more than anything else. "
2630,39717,2.0,Good guy.  
2631,39718,2.0,Amazing personality and medical knowledge. 
2632,39719,1.0,"he is a wonderful doctor, board certified and very commited to his patients. "
2633,39719,1.0,I've been with this doctor for years and he is very helpful. Somewhat knowledgeable on certain areas and will recommend other local specialists if needed. Definitely would recommend.  
2634,39719,1.0,.  
2635,39719,1.0,This doctor really knows his stuff!  He was a pharmacist before becoming a physician.  He cares for his patients and is not above waiving a fee for those who are truly in need.  Both he and his staff are true professionals with empathy and concern for the total well-being of the patient.  I would highly recommend him to anyone in need. 
2636,39720,1.0,"extremely helpful, very knowledgeable.  He really cares about you and is the best diagnostician I have ever seen.  Wish he could be my family doctor.  I have total faith in him. "
2637,39721,0.0,"I spent more time with the Medical student than I did w/him. My daughter went w/me for I am disabled & in a wheelchair, he spoke to her for a total of 3 min. & never looked me in the face or spoke to me. I would not send my enemy to him. His fees were outragous.  "
2638,39722,1.0,Dr. Carson is the best.  He performed my back surgery three years ago and did a great job. 
2639,39723,1.0,"He is prompt, courteous, polite &amp; listens to your concerns. Staff is helpful Dr's Nurses are very nice as well as up front office girls. Lady named Barbara who answers phones a lot could use a lil more kindness on handling phone calls. But overall very happy patient &amp; have been since they took over Dr. Shy's practice.  "
2640,39723,1.0,"Dr. Cremeans takes the time to listen to the patient.  It's reported on news channels that many doctors stop their patients within 15 seconds, and Dr. Cremeans has never done that.  He asks questions and discusses options.  He respects his patients.  In addition to Dr. Cremeans as an individual, I'd like to comment on his staff.  His nurse is one of the nicest people I've met, very competent and efficient.  His front staff calls you by your first name and doesn't treat you like a number.  Dr. Cremeans is a partner with Dr. Glenn Harper and they have really developed a fantastic family practice.  I had to choose a family doctor when I moved to the area three years ago, and that fear quickly dissolved when I had my first appointment and now my entire family goes there and we are all very, very happy with the quickness of appointments, friendliness of staff, and professionalism of the nurses and doctors. "
2641,39724,1.0,Dr. Collins is the best doctor ever!! He saved my sons life and for that i will always love him and will always have him in my prayers. 
2642,39725,1.0,"As a burn survivor, my partner has had to undergo many reconstructive surgeries in the care of Dr. Casuccio over the last 20+ years.    Dr. Casuccio is not only a great surgeon, but a great compassionate human.   I cannot say enough good things about Dr. Casuccio & his staff. "
2643,39726,1.0,I am a nurse at a different hospital and Dr Chamberlain's pt... he is one of the best drs I have ever came in contact with:) 
2644,39726,1.0,A wonderful ob.  My experience was much better with Dr. Chamberlain delivering my daughter.   Highly recommend! 
2645,39726,1.0,Very knowledgeabe and always very nice and understanding. He has been my doctor for 25 years and I would highly recommend him to anyone. 
2646,39726,1.0,His office is great!  Especially his wife who does the ultrasounds.  He is very caring and listens to your problems.  I use one of his midwifes on staff Patti Hackney and shes awesome!  Klara Kovacs is great too!  I know I could count on them in their scope of care if needed.  
2647,39726,1.0,"One of the most caring, kind and compassionate doctor I have ever met. Had problems with mesh sling, he doesn't just say he cares, he sent me to Cleveland Clinic and even held my hand as I was crying in his office, with my Husband. I was at the end of my rope when I first saw him, now I have had my surgery at Cleveland and doing much better. He brought my trust in Doctors back, something that I had lost. Takes time to talk to you and explain what is going on. He calls me back when I phone with a problem, not his nurse.  "
2648,39726,1.0,". I have never had a problem with Dr Chamberlain the whole time I have been seeing him, since 2002! He is a great doctor, and not only has he been good to me, but to my sister and sister-in-law as well! He has delivered everyone of our babies! "
2649,39726,1.0,"Very set in his ways.  Doesn't like patient to question his opinion.  There seems to only be one correct way to deal with things when you're his patient, otherwise he isn't that friendly.  "
2650,39727,1.0,"This Dr. Chaffin told me that my unborn child would never walk or talk.  He said that my child would be dependent on me for his whole life and that I should have an abortion.  I chose to have my child and he was born just fine!  He walks, he talks and makes all A's on his report card.  Just think if I would have have had an abortion I would have a assisted in killing a perfectly healthy baby.   Wonder how many other mothers he has told this to and they have actually had a termination of their pregnancy&#63;&#63; "
2651,39727,1.0,"I really hve enjoyed Dr.Chaffin. It is a little diff. from other Drs. I have been to because it is a Dr. Training hospital. He has a wonderful personality and has always answered my questions very honestly. He does not sugar coat any thing, however he is tacktful and I believe he truly cares for all of his patients. He also gets along with his staff, which makes the wait a little more pleasant. My family loves him... The Henrys "
2652,39727,1.0,I can't stand this dr. He was the 1st to diagnose that my baby had problems. He has awful bedside manner. For someone dealing w/ high risk patients he must have completely skipped sensitivity trainning in med school. He is an absolute a**. I always left his office hysterical & in tears. He repeatedly tried to push expiremental treatments on me & then proceeded to make me feel guilty for not accepting 100% expirmental drug & surgical treatments for my unborn baby when none of the dr.s including fetal specialist even know what exactly is wrong with my baby. When laying out some of my treatment options the specialist had told me about he basically concluded that I should either take expirmental treatment or terminate. Though this lack of bedside manner seems to be common among high risk dr.s all pregnant women know you have the right to choose your dr.  & when they can't give you any info don't assume their suggestions are the only way! They gave my baby 2wks its been 2 mnths he's due 2/07 
2653,39728,1.0,This doctor has been a lifesaver for me.He was there when I needed him and went above and beyond to help me.You just don't meet many people like him anymore now a days.You may have to wait a little while to see him.... but it is worth it 
2654,39729,1.0,"Dr. Chong could not even look at me.  He is the most awkward person I've ever seen attempt to be a doctor.  He did absolutely nothing for what I found out later to be severe bursitis, told me to just keep taking ibuprofen - forever!&#63;!&#63; He spent approximately 5 minutes in the room.  Never even touched me.  When I left, the staff said nothing.  Two weeks later, I received a bill for $87! This is a 'Free' Clinic, where most everyone in town pays no more than $15 - and for obvious reasons.  These peope are here for no other reason than to fill local prescriptions...(and that is why Spencer has the biggest teen-'prescription' drug problem in the state!) One work to sum it up IN-EPT. "
2655,39730,1.0,I can not express how wonderful this doctor is.  My experience with him is has been the anesthesiologist for a few of my childs surgeries.  Every time he has not only been professional but very warm towards my child.  He has never failed to ease their worries but to even make them smile.  He has a talent for what he does.  
2656,39731,0.0,"His office staff is VERY rude. I called to leave a message WITH INFORMATION FOR Dr Capel regarding my grandmother, who was in the hospital. The staff said they don't take messages from family; BOTH WOMEN WORKING IN HIS OFFICE said the message HAS TO COME FROM THE NURSE in the hospital. I told her I wasn't &quot;stupid&quot;; anyone can leave messages for the doctor. They're supposed to be professionals who deal with frustration on a daily basis. Today, they CAUSED frustration. VERY UNPROFESSIONAL! "
2657,39731,0.0,He does NOT listen to you and if you ask any type of question he YELLS at you. I never saw that side of him until he yelled at me when I asked a question. He yelled so loud everyone in the waiting room area heard him including my husband. We found another doctor.  
2658,39732,0.0,"I have seen dr c &amp; ruby both so far, I'm still in my 2nd trimester and so far, so good! They are very down to earth and I feel like they take time to talk and answer any questions. The wait time isn't great but that's what's expected when going to the doctor. And the ultrasound girl, Jen, is great! Every appt I have I feel like I'm going in to see good friends, not just medical staff. And about the other comments about the lack of knowledge..,nobody is perfect and knows everything! Give them a break!! In my opinion, they are very knowledgeable.  "
2659,39732,0.0,she was hardly there on january 19th 2011 i had an appt with her and for an ultrasound when i got there dr c ruby nor jen the ultrasoudn tec were there  i had been having severe pain in my stomach and felt very ill there was 2 receptionist and 1 nurse there ther nurse called me back wieghed me took me in a room and said any problems i todl her what was going on she said well im hte only one here i said i want the ultrasound now somehow she said well we have lives too we r not here to satisfy you and redid my ultrasound for a week later left tehre went to dr shockley saw him the next day my baby was still born and i believe it was their fault at dr c 
2660,39732,0.0,"I do not even know where to start on all the reasons why you should find another doctor. She is NEVER in town, her PA Ruby is unintelligent to almost the point of medical ignorance and getting an appointment is almost impossible no matter how serious the situation is. I have waited over 2hrs to see her and she spent maybe 5mins with me. She acted like I was wasting her time with my questions and this is my first pregnancy so I had a lot of them. Needless to say I had to look most of the information that I wanted up online myself. I got a kidney stone in my 2nd trimester and when I went to the hospital because of the horrible pain she refused me any medication at all and said if I couldnt handle the pain maybe I should re-think having the baby. She treated me like a drug addict because I asked for some kind of pain medication because the pain was unbearable. Needless to say I found another OBGYN.  "
2661,39732,0.0,"Really great doctor, there to listen to your concerns and willing to help you.  "
2662,39732,0.0,Dr C and the staff are great

2665,39733,1.0,"Excellant at every leval. Paid attention, answered all questions clearly and offered options.  "
2666,39734,1.0,I went to dr clark and I am a RN.  He would not listen to my concerns very worried about his computer the whole time. Let me know he did not like to doctor nurses.  He made statements twice.  I called for my yearly appointment and the office clerk told me he dropped me as a patient for no reason. He acts like he is doing a favor seeing you.  He also has no done his homework as to who are good referring surgeons 
2667,39735,2.0,Not very helpful or understanding and seemed annoyed when I asked questions. 
2668,39736,1.0,"Dr. Capito is thorough and cares deeply for all of his patients. He is helpful, polite, and does not rush his patients. I have been his patient for several years and have recommended him to family and friends. "
2669,39737,0.0,"Dr. Chambers is an excellent Dentist. I have personally worked for Doctors, and I can tell you before you take the above as gospel, remember there are always 2 sides to a patients story.  Bills not paid, patients making unrealistic demands, etc.  I recomment Dr. Chambers to all my friends and they are all very satisfied. "
2670,39737,0.0,"i went to see dr chambers to get the care i needed.  after speaking with the receptionist i was highly unhappy.  she was very rude and unprofessional to me, the patient.  they charged me for services that were not performed.  i called the office in pain because part of my filling came out and the receptionist stated &quot;what do you want me to do&quot;.  she never called back. i called her back and got continous voice mail. when i finally reached the office she answered again and was very rude and stated to me, &quot;yeah i remeber who youare&quot;, dr chambers really needs a reality check on whos running the front desk. i would never return to that office, and i do not recommend anyone to go there. "
2671,39737,0.0,"My first visit to Dr. Chambers was October 19, 2009 to get a new partial plate.  It is now April 1, 2010, and I have not yet gotten this plate.  I have had a total of 4 visits cancelled/rescheduled by his office due to the Doctor having a personal &quot;issue&quot; or crisis. I have already paid for the partial plate, or I would definitely go to another dentist.   I will never recommend this dentist to anyone!! "
2672,39738,2.0,"Finest doctor in Jackson County...kind, considerate and very attentive. Great with children too. Highly recommend. "
2673,39739,1.0,"I agree with U he is a sad excuse for a doctor, and yes he always wants to change you to a new drug, It is hard to get a appointment due to the amount of drug reps that take presidence over his patients. he loves to hear his own voice and will talk for a half an hour or more with anyone in the hallway that will listen, while you sit in your exam room waiting! Dr. saxe is lucky this quack is leaving. Dr. saxe is excellent. his front office staff does not want to answer phones they are not helpful and make alot of mistakes! they fail to fax important results of tests to your specialist, they act hateful when you finally get them on the phone. the only reason I still go here is becuase saxe is very good and nice. one last comment on cambell afew years ago he said a test was ok and it was not this resulted in a few months of something being wrong with me that a needed to be surgically removed.  now this is for you to decide, Was this a one time error or does Cambell make mistakes often&#63;&#63;&#63; "
2674,39739,1.0,"I think you sumed it up pretty well,I think he also gives too many drugs. "
2675,39739,1.0,"I believe this doctor to be a know it all,very arrogant,rude,who dont listen to the patient well.You are wasting your time making any suggestions.He already knows what he s going to do before you see him.A terrible bedside manner.He looks friendly but he is not.He talks short and snappy.Have your guard up if hes your doc,you will find out.His main interest is sports. I feel Hed rather be out playing sports,than being in the office.You will notice he has a sneaky fake smile too.These are my personal opinions from my experience.You may feel otherwise,please add your comments,as no other posts are here at this time on Dr Stephen Cambell "
2676,39740,1.0,. i have seen this doctor for several years  he is a very caring and compassionate doctor i also see him in church very caring and professional

2681,39740,1.0,"I &quot;had&quot; Bipolar Disorder and severe OCD. My first doctor did not help at all. After seeing Dr. Casdorph, he knew what medicines to take me off of and what medicines to start me on. Everyone out there; this guy saved my life!!! God worked threw him to help heal my suffering. I'm living proof that Bi-polar disorder &quot;CAN&quot; be treated successfully! Don't give up, BELIEVE ME! I've been down that dark, narrow road, I know how it feels to be an inch tall. God created you! If you're having any kind of trouble, seek Dr. Casdorph for help. He also has a wonderful staff. He is unlike any doctor I have ever been to. It's amazing how much better I feel when I am taking medicine. I would love to not be taking medicine, but this disorder along with Schizophrenia &quot;require&quot; long-term medication. It's just like having diabetes or a heart problem. Stay on your medicine(s). He works with kids who have ADHD and is great with adults too. "
2682,39741,1.0,I first went to see Dr. Cassis when I was in high school and didn't even know that I had thyroid problems.  He was very knowledgeable and helped me and my family threw the difficult disease (after all this is something that most young people do not face).  The staff in Dr. Cassis' office is amazing too; they feel like extended family to me.  I know that you sometimes have to wait a little while to go in for your appointment but Dr. Cassis is worth it.  He will take his time and talk with you about all your concerns.  I am now out of college with a family of my own and I still have scheduled appointments every six months.  I would recommend Dr. Cassis to anyone; he is a great physician with a caring staff.  
2683,39741,1.0,Never puts a refill on my medicine the doseage has never changed there is no reason to run to that office every month except for the fact he charges medicaid $211.00 for a 5 min visit. 
2684,39741,1.0,A typical wait for this doctor is over 1 hour. His office does not call with reminders for appointments even though these are scheduled three months in advance. His office makes appointments without notifying the patient in writing of the new appointment date. Patient questions were not answered.  
2685,39742,1.0,.  
2686,39742,1.0,I think he is a great dr and has a great staff had my gall bladder removed he talked to me and my family first. whenever I had questions I get answer I would recommend him to my family friends or strangers 
2687,39742,1.0,I think this is ludacris to write a comment as such in the medical field everyone's case scenario is different ! Patients are protected by hippa but to be able to write a comment on your situation with out knowing all the facts to slander someones reputation is ridiculous ! Yes I know this surgeon and he is one who cares for his patients and I have been on both sides. I would highly recommend him to anyone as I have in many cases. He is a caring wonderful bedside manner. In your situation I am sorry you had such a terrible experience but please present all the facts as you are protected by HIPPA laws but what about the physician. 
2688,39742,1.0,"Dr. Casto removed what I thought was a cyst and found out 2 weeks after surgery that it was a enlarged lymph node. After I had surgery and was in the recovery room, he never once came and spoke with my family.  Prior to surgery he never requested any type of pre op test either (blood panels).  I was told on the day of surgery that I had a $75.00 copay for outpatient services, which was paid on day of surgery.  I was told a month later that I still owed a $75.00 copay for outpatient services which was never advised by any one in his office.  They also make you pay your normal copay and never bill the insurance.  I think they have a scam going on.  For the surgery and healing process, it didn't heal.  Two weeks after having surgery the stitches were removed and 3 days later had to have my head reopened and a drain put in.  The drain was in for over 2 weeks.  It still has not completely healed.  I can't say that I would recommend him to anybody.  "
2689,39743,1.0,i didnt care for his  behavior not helpful at all. he put me on medicine that was not helpful at all he was mean at times. 
2690,39743,1.0,Dr. Corder suggested a treatment that directly contradicted my experience and other doctors' recommendations- to follow his advice would have proved dangerous to me. I suggest choosing another doctor.  
2691,39744,1.0,"Dr. Covelli performed a mastectomy on me.   He is a thorough, meticulous, skilled surgeon who also has a lot of knowledge about cancer.  He is a kind, caring man.  He has an easy-going manner that makes you feel comfortable around him.  His patience and understanding made the whole experience easier for me.  I highly recommend him. "
2692,39744,1.0,I have been a patient of Dr. Covelli for about four years. He operated on me for Colon Cancer four years ago. He seems to be a very knowledgeable and caring physician and I highly recommend him. 
2693,39744,1.0, 
2694,39745,1.0,"Dr. Childers is an excellent physician. My son and my daughter both love him.  I am lucky to have very healthy children, so we are not often in his office.  However, when my son was an infant he had a very scary episode in which he shook in a manner that led me to believe it could have been a seizure.  Dr. Childers took me very seriously and immediately ordered tests to rule out any sort of major problem.  He always listens and never talks down to me or makes me feel like I don't know what I'm doing as a parent.  My kids are extremely comfortable with him.  Going to the doctor has NEVER been a negative experience for us. "
2695,39745,1.0,"I agree Dr.Childers is a nice man, but that doesn't make a good Doctor. He made some pretty poor choices for my daughter, and I might add dropped the ball more than once. He doesn't like to listen to mothers or therapist who take the time to listen and watch your child in every day activities such as eating. example my daughter was having trouble swallowing and he kept saying oh it is acid reflux but instead after getting a second opinion she has a chronic condition known as cricopharngeal dysfunction and has since had 9 surgeries in Cincinnati so yes he is nice if you have very healthy kids but he did not take the time to listen to me or the therapist who kept asking him to order a second swallow study. the reason i took the time to write all of this is because mothers you need to listen to your gut and not listen to everything that a doctor tells you.  "
2696,39745,1.0,I just love Dr. Childers & so do my grandchildren. He is a very caring & helpful Dr.  
2697,39745,1.0,Dr. Childers is a wonderful doctor.  Both my children love him.  He never fails to answer any of my question and is always very thorough.  
2698,39745,1.0,Dr. Childers always take the time to answer the questions of his parents. He is fantastic with the children and makes them feel very comfortable. He is the best we've ever had.  
2699,39745,1.0,Dr. Childer's is a great pediatrician. I wouldn't take my kids to anyone else but him. I would highly recommend to anyone who wants a doctor that your kids are going to love and is very polite and thorough as well.  
2700,39745,1.0,"Very good doc, very courteous and THOROUGH. Would refer him to anyone.  "
2701,39745,1.0,"Although Dr. Childers is very nice and polite, he is always in a hurry and not thorough.  "
2702,39746,2.0,Very caring and very patient.  Best ER Doc I have ever been treated by 
2703,39747,0.0,"Dr. Chidester is amazing. I may have to wait a bit to see her, but I know that when she's with me, she spends time with me and makes sure that we are doing the best plan for me. She is incredibly caring and knowledgeable and I trust explicitly.  "
2704,39747,0.0,"Dr. Chidester is one of a kind. She has been there for me through some of my most trying times. She is not your run of the mill doctor. She takes the time to listen to you, will sit down and carry on a conversation with you and treat you like you are a real person, and not just a &quot;condition&quot; that needs to be treated. She has let me cry to her many times and has seemed genuinely concerned for me. She has also been so happy to see me doing well. She truly is vested in her patients and their wellbeing. She always gives me her opinion but ultimately asks what I would like to do and helps me determine the best course of treatment. So many people in the area want to go to the local university to get what they consider to be &quot;the best care&quot;. I can promise that Dr. Chidester is the most caring, compassionate, knowledgeable doctor that you could ask for! "
2705,39748,0.0,"Dr. Campbell is unable and unwilling to listen to her patients' concerns. Her inexperience dealing with patient concerns and questions was evidenced by her anchoring on the fact that a patient had something contrary to state about the medical profession and clearly ignored the concern.  It was about the patient, not about someones qualifications, not about someones personality and definitely not about me.  We are firing her, yes thats right, we are firing Dr. Campbell for her inability and unwillingness to listen to her patients' concerns. "
2706,39749,1.0,"Very knowledgeable guy.  He knows exactly what he is doing and is a pleasure to see whenever I need help.  He is extremely down to earth and always makes sure I leave knowing exactly what I'm getting and why I'm getting it.  Wouldn't trade him for anyone in the world.  His down-to-earth personality may give some people a negative aura of unprofessionalism, but to others such as myself it's a way to broadcast a comfortable feeling.  It makes me realize that I'm being treated by a real person who actually cares about his patients and not the stereotypical overpaid doctor.  "
2707,39749,1.0,. real nut job 
2708,39750,1.0,"Dr. Chaney always takes the time to answer all of my questions.  His office is (or, at least used to be) open on Saturdays.  They can always get you in quickly in the event of sudden illness.  I really, really like him and the office in general. "
2709,39750,1.0,"I have gone to Dr. Chaney since I was a child. He is an amazing doctor, and even though I now live in Kentucky--I still visit his office on trips home, because I trust him more than any other doctor.  "
2710,39750,1.0,"Apts. are never on time for any of the Drs. in this joint practice. But, they are the only ones I know open half-days on the weekends. If you ask questions (and I do ask many) - you get answers; full and complete. Have gotten full explanations on test results, drug interactions, etc.  Has a very dry sense of humor, which some may not take well, but so do I so no problem. "
2711,39750,1.0,Treats all symptoms with a perscription.  Doesn't look for the cause of any illness.  Does not practice preventative care.  Bedside manner is the pits.  
2712,39751,2.0, 
2713,39752,1.0,"I know he tried to help me, but was more interested in his cosmetic part of the business. First visit he told me that he does not go to the hospital to his patients, that there are perfectly good drs there to take care of me!  Secondly, he put me on an antidepressant that made me lose 30 pounds.  I am now down to 115 pounds and was having a lot of problems.  Switched drs and I am on the mend.  Physically and emotionally.  Chapman is a nice man but like most drs I have seen, just doesnt have the concern for his patients that he should have.  Sorry Doc.  "
2714,39752,1.0,Overall Dr. Chapman was on his game the first few years that I went to him. Now it seems that he does not have time for his patients he throws them to the wolves with no concern for their health at all anymore. He is always late and behind and more worried about socializing than being a doctor and professional in his office environment. His office staff are very rude and spend their time socializing and talking on the phone rather than their job. I will probably not be continuing my medical relationship with this doctor and find another primary doctor. Overall he needs to be more on his game and his office staff need some customer service training.  
2715,39752,1.0,"Dr. Chapman is a wonderful and patient person.  If you have an issue he WILL take the time to explain things, as well as explore multiple avenues of treatment if they are available.  His aggressive care SAVED my grandmothers life (90% arterial blockage with no symptoms)!!!  He really knows the &quot;Ins-and-Outs&quot; of his patients’ conditions and uses cutting edge equipment (just look around his office).  My family has seen him for years, including myself.  Without question, this is where my children will be seen when they reach the proper age.  Simply put, he is an EXCELLENT doctor with EXCEPTIONAL bedside manner.  I highly recommend Dr. Chapman and I’m VERY thorough and selective concerning my family’s healthcare providers, as well as my own.  F.Y.I. - I have been a registered nurse in the Charleston area for 7 ½ years.  "
2716,39752,1.0,"Horrible doctor, horrible person.  Staff treated me like I wasn't worth their time and they were rude.  Dr. Chapman was very unprofessional and didn't know what he was talking about.  He didn't give me enough time and didn't treat my condition me correctly.  Very very unprofessional and rude office as a whole.  "
2717,39753,0.0,"The most polite, down to earth, knowledgible Dr. I have ever met. Always concerned and wanting to help.  "
2718,39753,0.0,"very thorough and knowledgeable, took the time to explain things.  "
2719,39753,0.0,Dr Chesnut is very friendly and If you are looking for a Dr that will be there when things get bad SHE is it. I know She has always been there for me and her staff is some of the nicest you will meet.  
2720,39754,1.0,"Doctor is kind, caring, and makes decisions that are best for his patients.  "
2721,39755,1.0,"I am pregnant with my first baby! I really like Dr.Cotes even though I have only met him once which I totally understand he is a really busy man! I scheduled an appointment to meet him and the day of my appointment I got a phone call from his doctors office. They said I would not get to meet with him at that appointment because he had to go in for an emergency surgery. But he did everything to still make it to my appointment to meet me which I thought was very careing of him. His PA.s are very nice to! I remember my firs visit i was very nervous and they just mad me feel very relaxed by just talking to me! If i have another kid a couple years from now Dr,  .Cotes will be my doctor if he is still deliverying babies.  "
2722,39755,1.0,"While I was sometimes unhappy with wait times (schedule first thing in the morning and you'll be golden), I came to understand that the reason we waited was because Dr. Cotes cared so much about each patient that he never rushed anyone.  He always errs on the side of caution.   His bedside manner is unparalleled.  I was also unhappy sometimes that with a normally developing pregnancy (not high risk) I saw the PAs more than I would have liked.  He is down at the hospital a lot delivering and doing surgeries, so that happens.  However, if there is a problem, as I saw with my sister's pregnancies, he will be there for you.  He CARES.  He will never blow you off or disregard your concerns, and HE will be the one to deliver your baby, regardless of whether he's making rounds then or not.  He must live at the hospital! He will be available to you night and day by phone.  HE will meet you at OB if you're having a problem.  You just can't put a monetary value to those kinds of things.  "
2723,39755,1.0,"I have been a patiend of Dr. Cotes for many years.  He delivered both my boys.  I had complications with both pregnancies and he was ALWAYS available to me at ANYTIME day or night.  I think the man must LIVE at the hospital!  He is kind, caring, and ALWAYS reassuring.   I wouldn't go through a pregnancy/delivery without him!!! "
2724,39755,1.0,Dr.Cotes has delievered both of my son's and i had to have c-sections with them both but even though i did I was greatful to him and owe him my life for saving both of my boys. I lost one when I was with Dr.Patel and he didnt even try to stop it and Dr.Cotes did my dnc so i switched to him after that and was pregnant again in a year and a day  I started to miscarry and Dr.Cotes did every test possible to find the problem and did he saved my son from me miscarring him and then again when i went into labor. He is a great man who always has a smile on his face and always does his best for the patient and the baby. His staff is wonderful and very kind. I would refer him to anyone and have referd him to a few ppl.  
2725,39755,1.0,"I was transferred from Dr Luby's practice when I found out I was pregnant.  I didn't get to meet the Dr. until I got upset at the number of visits I'd had w/o seeing the man who would deliver my baby.  Yes, the man is VERY busy!  But, my body...and my baby was worth asking and how do you learn to trust someone you've never met&#63;  I am still upset that I had to ASK to actually see the dr.  Anyhoo, after the initial visit (with the doctor!!) I was able to ask the questions I needed.  Overall...very healthy pregnancy.  All the tests made me feel as though they were watching everything closely, which I appreciated VERY MUCH!  My complaints at the hospital...the ER did not provide a wheel chair.  I had to walk all the way back to the OB unit (thank God i had someone with me).  Had to literally beg for one when I left...VERY MAD ABOUT THAT RIGHT NOW.  15 weeks pregnant now, and considering maybe not going back there.  but theres alot of things to consider.  "
2726,39755,1.0,"I love Dr. Cotes. I had a very hard time with my first pregnancy and believe I would not have delivered a healthy baby if it wasn't for Dr. Cotes. Im seeing him now, three years later, for my second pregnancy. He remembers all the problems I had with the first and is always on top of things. He has a great bedside manner. I was hospitalized for three months with my first and he seemed to always be at the hospital. He even checked on me once at 4am! His staff are all great also. The wait in the office is well worth the care.  "
2727,39755,1.0,"WAIT TIMES BEFORE AN APPT ARE UNBEARABLE! HUGE PREGNANT WOMEN WOULD HAVE TO SIT ON THE FLOOR OR STAND FOR 1 TO 2 HOURS EVERY APPT. I KNOW I HAD THIS PROBLEM THROUGHOUT MY WHOLE PREGNANCY.....I AM NOT GOING TO SEE HIM FOR MY SECOND BABY JUST BECAUSE OF THIS REASON. PLUS, MOST OF THE TIME, I ONLY SAW HIS PA, ONCE EVER 3 MONTHS I SAW HIM. PLUS THE DAY I DELIVERED. "
2728,39755,1.0,"I went to Dr Cotes' office because I wanted to see the same doctor throughout my pregnancy who would deliver my baby, and he got good reviews on this website. But I was NEVER seen by the doctor, only by PA's.  I met the doctor one time when I was 5 months pregnant. At 8 months pregnant I took a childbirth class at Thomas where I asked the nurse about some of Dr. Cotes' policies.  I found out that he likes to induce labor as soon as the pregnancy hits 39 weeks.  Knowing that inducing labor before a woman is ready can lead to an unnecessary c-section, I asked about c-section rates at Thomas Hospital and found out they were above 30%, VERY high. With this information, at almost 9 months pregnant, I switched to a midwifery practice, Womencare WV. I have never waited more than half an hour to see someone with them, while the wait in Cotes' office was always over an hour. He may be a great doctor, but you wont probably see him until you are ready to deliver.  "
2729,39755,1.0,I was transferred to Dr. Cotes after my ob quit delivering in the middle of my pregnancy.  Dr. Cotes and his staff were absolutely the answer to a prayer.  You do have to wait because of the nature of his office.  But he is definitely worth the wait.  I decided to stay with him after my sons birth because there is no kinder or more concerned physician.  He answers questions and offers information.   His staff was never anything but kind to me!  I love them all!! 
2730,39755,1.0,"Dr. Cotes has been my OB/Gyn for 17 years now and I have nothing but great things to say about him. He has 2 PA's Tara & Kristine. I don't care much for Tara, but Kristine has been great. I think Tara has to get to know you a little. I have been in his office alot lately (hysterectomy) and it seems like she is the only one I ever get to see anymore. I just wish he was the one who did the follow up visits after getting out og the hospital, but as anyone who has ever went to him knows he is very busy. When I was in the hospital the nurses would come in at all hours telling me he just called checking up on me. There is not a whole lot you can say other than he is a wonderful doctor and makes every patient feel like they are is only patient. He is the best.  "
2731,39755,1.0,He is just wonderful he has amazing bedside manner. He always made me feel comfortable even when my pregnancy presented problems. He goes out of his way to make sure all your concerns are addressed and he is very thorough. The staff in his office is wonderful as well. Very friendly and knowledgeable. The wait is sometimes very long and he is frequently late but as others have said this is to no fault of his own. Its because of deliveries and giving good care. Well worth the wait. When I was hospitalized I often saw him checking in on patients as late as 10 p.m. Compared to the high risk doctors I'm seeing now it makes me wish he were a high risk doctor.  
2732,39755,1.0,He is a great doctor. He has great bedside mannor. He will take time to listen to you. While the wait is sometimes quite long he's worth it. His knowledge about both OB and GYN problems is very helpful if your having fertility problems and he will do everything in his power to help you before referring you to a specialist. 
2733,39755,1.0,"Wonderful OB/GYN. As a physician myself, I can say that he has an incredible bedside manner. My wife and I can not say enough good things about Dr. Cotes. Dedicated, thoughtful, knowledgeable, informative. His staff is caring and friendly. The only possible negative is that he does run behind a little, but it is because of deliveries or taking time with patients to answer questions. Well worth it. Amazing experience overall.  "
2734,39755,1.0,"Doctor Cotes is a very busy doctor, but he will go out of his way to help you. He is caring and brilliant! "
2735,39756,0.0,Excellent Doctor - spent a lot of time going over symptoms and possible solutions.  Worked carefully with other meds and is doing testing rule out some possibilities.  She is wonderful expecially if going through menopuase! 
2736,39756,0.0,"AMAZING! Dr Chua cares so much for her patients and only wants the absoluetly best for every single one of them. Because she is a newer doctor, she listens to everything and doesn't take a chance of something bad happening. WONDERFUL WONDERFUL doctor! "
2737,39757,1.0,fast diagnosis &amp; treatment of problem.   Great results from surgery 
2738,39757,1.0,"Dr. Crigger has preformed over 10 surgeries for our family, and we have been completely satisfied every time! He is very friendly and so is his staff..you don't feel like just another patient, but like they really care! "
2739,39757,1.0,"Wonderful! Dr. Crigger spent a great deal of time with us, explaining the surgical procedure my son was to have (tonsils/adnoids surgery) and answered all of our questions.  Like the earlier comment, I was a little apprehensive about some of the negative things I had heard, he does call it the way he sees it, but he was GREAT!  Although my son's problem was solved, I will go to him in the future for any other family members and recommend him.  Hope this helps! "
2740,39757,1.0,"This man is wonderful! Three of our 4 children have seen him for ear tubes and one has had her tonsils removed. He takes plenty of time to talk with us and work with our children. He's a caring Dr., despite hearing a little negativity prior to us first visiting him. His staff are all WONDERFUL. They have always worked with us re: scheduling and last minute appointments. When I've called after hours he calls back himself within 30 minutes. Love this man! My grandmother and father-in-law also see him and appreciate his service.  "
2741,39758,2.0,Very caring doctor. Spends a lot of time with you. Plan on a long wait but you will get great service and lots of time 
2742,39759,1.0,"I went to this doctor for a herniated lumbar disk with drop foot (left leg). After his PA spent 15 minutes with me taking all the initial details and running some neurological basic tests (which I did not pass) The Dr. came in without further delay to tell me there was nothing he could do for me and that I was not a candidate for surgery. He explained that he had seen the the results of my MRI and could not see why I was in such pain. He dismissed me with a referral for more PT. I did not get better, in fact I got worst and 3 weeks later ended up in the hospital having to have emergency back surgery for the severity of my condition. Another doctor saw what this one was not able to see and acted accordingly, returning to me my life and abilities to walk again.......  "
2743,39759,1.0,"Didn't do nothing for me. Very short. Have bulging disc and and spurs. He couldn't say anything except He was a surgeon and i didn't need surgery, maybe it was fibromylia.What a quack. "
2744,39759,1.0,I was so disappointed when I left htis office I was crying. He stated that he could do surgery and help the pain in my leg but could not help my back pain. Understandable...But then he reports back to workers comp that he offered to do surgery on my herinated disc and he never. I can't beleive that we go to these doctors and they are paid big bucks and we are treated this way. I am in pain everyday and cannot have intercourse with my husband due to the pain and they tell me to go to pain management clinics and then workers comp refuses it because I refused surgery. I went htere to get better not to be lied to and about. Why are these doctors doing this to inicent people. I was referred to him. I don't recommend anyone to him. think about it if you have an appt with him. Doctors are suppose to help us not criticize us. A true doctor doesn't do what he did. To me He is not a doctor and I wouldn't call myself a doctor if I was him.  He needs to think about the patient and their needs!!!!!! 
2745,39759,1.0,This DR is very short and is very insulting and I would never recomend him to anyone.  
2746,39759,1.0,I went to Dr. Crow for a consult that I needed spinal surgery. I have 3 disks in my neck conpressing on spinal cord and left and right nerve roots affecting both arms. He said surgery would not help. I am guessing he made his millions all ready and didnt want to bother with me since I was a Brickstreet case. I have progressively gotten worse and having a hard time getting Brickstreet to allow me to find a Dr. willing to do the surgery my primary Dr. and Orthopedic Dr. says I need for my condition to improve. 
2747,39759,1.0,he is a very good doctor . 
2748,39760,1.0,Doctor orders expensive drugs not approved by the company's protocol.  Drugs not paid for by the insurance company.  Arixtra.  His prescription could be deadly. He misdiagnosed a broken femur as a broken hip.  
2749,39761,2.0,. this is a very good doctor 
2750,39762,1.0,The receptionist and the nursing staff are always helpful and caring.  The doctor is very knowledgeable.  
2751,39762,1.0,Dr would not see me based on his nurse's input. Purely personal. 
2752,39763,0.0,"Dr. Clark has a great bedside manner, and her voice is so soothing that I think she should record some sort of 24-hour hotline for people to call just to hear her talk - just hearing her voice is so calming for me!  She doesn't rush through the exam, doesn't make the exam awkward, and always has time for questions.   Highly recommended! "
2753,39763,0.0,Wonderful and caring. Great bedside manner. Doesn't rush through your visit.  
2754,39763,0.0,I love Dr. Clark!!  She is only accepting pregnant patients at this time. She is very helpful and an all around GREAT OB/GYN! I can't give her enough credit...pick her... you won't be sorry! Also every one of her staff is extremely friendly and helpful!!! 
2755,39763,0.0,I absolutely love Dr. Clark - I think she is very knowledgeable as well as having an excellent bedside manner. She makes what is normally an uncomfortable exam not bad at all. Highly recommended!

2763,39770,0.0,"POLICY MAKE APPOINTS AT 5pm, WHICH TIME THEY CLOSE.  THEY CALL ON THE APPOINTED DATE TO GET YOU TO COME IN EARLIER. IF YOU CAN'T, THEY CANCEL THE APPOINTMENT AND THEN REPORT THAT YOU DID NOT SHOW UP. A DISABILITY DR THAT JUST MILKS THE GOVERNMENT OUT OF TAXPAYERS MONEY, WHILE WORKING AGAINST PEOPLE. IF GIVEN THIS DR, CALL CASEWORKER AND TELL THEM OF THIS POLICY AND THE BAD REVIEWS THIS DR HAS RECEIVED. IF YOU QUESTION THE SECRETARY WHO ALSO STATES SHE IS THE OFFICE MANAGER, SHE WILL HANG UP ON YOU, AS WILL THE DR, JUST FOR ASKING QUESTIONS. SHE WILL REFUSE TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS ONLY STATING THAT IF YOU DO NOT SHOW UP BY 5pm, THEY WILL LEAVE. HOWEVER, WE WERE ASKED TO COME IN HOURS EARLIER, NOT A FEW MINUTES. THEY KNOW FULL WELL THAT THEIR LYING BEHAVIOR WILL HURT A PATIENT TRYING FOR DISABILITY. SON IN IRAQ WAR. DR TOLD MY SON TO CALL HIS CASEWORKER AND STATE THAT HE MISSED THE APPOINTMENT. IT WAS ONLY AROUND 3PM, APPOINTMENT AT 5PM. REFUSE THIS DR. GOV DISABILITY DISCRIMINATION.  "
2764,39771,1.0,Dr. Crews is an excellent dentist and now makes his own crowns while you wait.  His office staff is very friendly.  I highly recommend him.  
2765,39772,0.0,"Dr. Cisco is a great surgeon. She is the best in her field in my opinion. She had me scheduled for surgery in no time. Was very polite and helpful. She made me feel very comefortable and was very knowledgable about my surgery. She was very explanitory about everything which I thing is great. If I have to have surgery again, I hope she will be the one to do it. I urge anyone who may have to have surgery, request Dr. Cisco. Thanks for everything Dr. Cisco, you are the best. J.

2766,39773,2.0,Good Doctor 
2767,39774,1.0,Extremely helpful staff. Everyone was polite and personable. Dr. Cox is a great optometrist and cares about how you are taking care of your vision. Overall I would say this is the best place to go in the area! 
2768,39774,1.0,"Everyone was cheerful and very helpful. Patient and helpful as I couldn't make up my mind when selecting frames.  Dr. Cox is personable and caring asked how the family was and asked about my job, I appreciated that. Explained all he was doing and answered all my questions and  made suggestions that I wouldn't have thought to ask. "
2769,39774,1.0,"I thought Dr cox was pretty cool. He's not the most outgoing personality or anything, but he made it a point to ask about my job, etc, and took extra time to answer my questions about the eye, contacts, and how my vision prescription affects certain aspects of my life when I'm without glasses or contacts. I'd rather have a doctor that has time to address my concerns than one that shuffles me out as fast as possible without going into any detail or acknowledging that I'm an intelligent creature who wants to understand my physiology in order to live a lifestyle that supports good overall health.    I was in the exam room within 10 minutes of my appointment, and the staff was friendly and prompt. Everyone makes personal calls at work on occasion. Sometimes important things come up and must be addressed immediately. I was referred there by a friend and I would do the same for someone else if the opportunity came along.    It was a good experience overall.  "
2770,39774,1.0,"Difficult time scheduling an appointment.  Phyisican was course and abrupt. I felt uncomfortable and uneasy.  Physician was upset and angry about 1-800-Contacts and used my time to express his distrust in the company. I did not receive my contact prescription, left with a free pair to try for a couple weeks and will have to return for another visit.  Have been wearing contacts for 20 years.  Receptionist spent alot of time on personal call while I waited to pay my bill.  No other patient was there.  Have alot of experience with medical professionals and am still confused about the whole experience. "

2777,39778,1.0,"i was givin plavix, i changed dr. found out i was treated for wrong problems. always always 45 min. to 90 min. to be seen on my apts. "
2778,39778,1.0,"I would not recommend him. If you cancel an appointment you are expected to call. If he fails to show or changes his schedule, you are SOL. "
2779,39778,1.0,"Love the staff. They do a good job covering for him not showing up! That being said, I like Dr. Chaney.  I just wish he would keep his appointments! "
2780,39778,1.0,"I find that Dr Chaney is a very caring person who has gone the extra mile to find aND TREAT MY MEDICAL PROBLEMS. He has found what other  drs have not, and treated me in a manner which i I agree with.  "
2781,39778,1.0,. billed ins when didnt see at times      wrong address 
2782,39779,1.0,"When I had a hernia surgery, he told me he would just sew it up but instead he said he EXPERIMENTED on me.  I had to find another doctor to explore and he had to remove the mesh because it was broke into a lot of pieces. Today i am still having bad problems from the surgery he did on me. I will never trust him to do anything else.  "
2783,39780,0.0,"After my insurance company requested I have a doctor fill out a basic wellness screening form, I decided to give Dr. Chapman's office a try.  After my lab works came in, her office refused to either mail or fax the form to me or my insurance company.  Stating that if I lived out of the area they could but they couldn't waste their time faxing or mailing the form back to me.  Being that her office is only open 8:15 to 4:30 most days I had to take time out of my job, to drive to their office, to pick up a form just they were not 'inconvenienced', as if their time is the only one that matters. "
2784,39781,1.0,Incredible Physician and customer service.  I am always impressed with his compassion.  
2785,39781,1.0,Paul Conley is a wonderfuldoctor he cares so much for his patients and does whatever he can to help and when he does help he does it with excellance. I'm so glad he is my doctor i wouldn't have it any other way.

Most grateful!!!!! "
2787,39782,1.0,Dr. Chambers is a fantastic doctor! He is caring and knowledgeable.  He took the time to properly diagnose my problems. He explained what type of treatment that would be needed to fix the problem.  The chiropractic care with the addition of acupuncture relieved my pain and I was able to get quality of life back again.  I would recommend Dr. Chambers to everyone.   He is a great! 
2788,39782,1.0,"Great doctor, one of the best. Friendly , kind gentle treatments. Helps all tryes of health conditions. Does chiropractic, Acupuncture, and functional health. "

2791,39785,1.0,"I agree with the other comment on here.He deserves alot of credit.Dr.Craig cares about every patient he sees. He is extremely helpful and Im sure he saves many lives, due to his caring nature and expertise in his field. I cannot give this Dr. enough credit. "
2792,39785,1.0,Dr Craig is the most knowledgeable and caring Dr I have met. Lots of people are alive and well because of his skill and care. I can not recommend him highly enough. He deserves a 10 out of 5.

2794,39786,0.0,I just wanted to let everyone know that Dr. Cabaniss was the best.  Her enthusiasm for her job was always evident and she was always helpful and informative and made me feel at ease throughout my pregnancy.  
2795,39786,0.0,"I love, Love, Love her and her staff.  My beautiful daughter was brought into this world by her.  I think if I was younger, I would have more children just so I could go and see her once a month.  We Ukiahians are so, so lucky to have her.  "

2798,39786,0.0,She was the best doctor I ever had. Sure do miss her in WV. She was there to deliver my three children. She answered every question that I had and was there to help with every concern.  
2799,39786,0.0,Dr. Cabaniss was the best doctor I ever has. I was a patient in Parkersburg after having two miscarriages she helped me through and performed a c section to  get my twin daughter here. She is missed and can never be replaced wish she would come back to West Virginia. She was always there any time i needed her she was there. I know my twins would not be here health and eight years old. My girls are only here because of the care I received from her. I just hope her patients in California appreciate her.  
2800,39786,0.0,"I have one word for Dr.Cabaniss!!! AWESOME! I was one of her first patients in Parkersburg, WV and I'm so lost without her now! She was the best Doctor I have ever met! I have yet to find a doctor I trust and like the way I trusted her! There is know one like her!  She cared! She loved her patients! Any Doctor that can call you at home and check on you is more than a doctor, she's your friend too. She is wonderful! I thank God that we have doctors like her! I wish we could have her back!! If I were rich, I would fly to CA for my check ups, just to still have her as my doctor! Dr.Cabaniss If you're reading this, know that you're missed. Amy :o) "
2801,39786,0.0,"I seen Dr. Cabaniss for the delivery of my first born child, and during my pregnancy and delivery of my second child when she practiced in Parkersburg....absolute best doctor around!!! Highly recommend her to any woman of any age. Very knowledgeable and educated on current medical issues. Wonderful personality, great FRIEND to her patients, caring, and personable. A great loss for us in Parkersburg. Hope those in CA. will love her as much as we here do. First class, top of the line doctor.  You can't ask for better service! We miss her very much!!!!! "
2802,39786,0.0,She wouldn't meet with me until it was too late and I had already had a miscarriage. This was a horrible experience and I would expect my Dr. to be more caring! 
2803,39786,0.0,"Doctor Cabaniss is a great doctor and friend. She was very caring and always had a hug to give. She was also very thorough and took time with her patients. She delivered my first baby 13yrs ago, and she did a wonderful job. I was sad that I was unable to see her for my second pregnacy due to insurance reasons. I believe if she'd been my doctor I may not of had a c-section for the my second delivery. I truely miss her and hope all is well for her in calif. "
2804,39786,0.0,"She was absolutely great.  She possesses the quality of making everyone in her presence feel like they are the most important person in the world. She was professional, but most importantly she was confident.   I would recommend her to anyone! "
2805,39786,0.0,Dr. Cabaniss is the first doctor I have met who actually seems to care for her patients and takes the time to get to know them. She is the best thing to happen to Ukiah in a long time and I hope she likes it here as much as I and I'm sure many others appreciate her being here.  
2806,39786,0.0,"Dr Cabaniss is the best doctor I have ever had.  She is energetic, has a wonderful personality, and really cared about me as a patient.  I recommend her to anybody I can.  My husband and I were completely satisfied with her service (we had a not-so-good doctor for my first pregnancy), and will go to her if we decide to have another child.  I live an hour and a half away from Ukiah and seeing Dr. Cananiss was well worth the drive.  Dr. Cabaniss is the best and even though I had a difficult pregnancy, I felt very safe in her hands.  "
2807,39786,0.0,"This doctor was a hysterical, unrealistic doctor.She never got back to me about the results of my tests. I had to call her. When she read the results of my tests, she became hysterical that I would end up dead just like her mother and grandmother. I had to calm her down.I would not recommend her to any woman.  "
2808,39786,0.0,"I was a patient of Dr. Cabaniss in Parkersburg for 12 years.  I miss her very much!  Dr Cabaniss was wonderful so caring and compasionate, through my 4 miscarriages.  She provided me with the best care - I couldn't have asked for more.  I was pregnant for the 5th time when she moved.  I wish so much that she could see my 2 children, because if it wasn't for her care, treatment and recommendations I would not have them.  "
2809,39786,0.0,Dr.Cabaniss is a great doctor shes top notch and takes good care of me.. her staff is also a lot of help 
2810,39786,0.0,"Dr. Cabaniss was my doctor in Parkersburg, WV, until she moved to CA. She is irreplacable. She was kind, understanding, patient, and, most of all, understood the needs of her patients. I wouldn't have wanted anyone else to deliver my child. She and her staff provided us with nothing but positive and helpful experiences. Any woman should be considered lucky to have her as their doctor.  "
2811,39786,0.0,"Dr. Cabaniss is by far Irreplaceable in Parkersburg, WV.  She truly cared about me and my family for out 2 years of infertility and then through the birth of my 3 children!  If anyone complains about her promptness then you do not understand how she practices.   SHE gives of herself 100% to all of her patients and if you have to wait, it is probably because she is with another patient and she would do the same for you!!! "
2812,39786,0.0,"Dr. Cabaniss is the BEST!!  When I found her I had lost one child and was pregnant with my second.  She hooked me up with one of the greatest endocrinologists in our area.  Thanks to her I have two very healthy boys, and my diabetes couldn't be better thanks to her intervention. The only reason she keeps people waiting is because she's delivering a baby or still with another patient. You may have to wait, but she gives everyone the same attention and the same care.When Dr. Cabaniss went to California, Parkersburg West Virginia lost the greatest OB/GYN for many miles.  "
2813,39786,0.0,"Dr. Cabaniss was my doctor in Parkersburg, WV.  She helped me through a miscarriage and months later the delivery of my 2nd child.  She is a wonderful physician.  She remembers personal things about you/your family.  She treats you as a friend.  She is not one of those doctors who has their hand on the doorknob to rush out of the room.  I had moved from the area and I see that she has, too.  I wish her all the best and any patient is lucky to have her as their physician. "
2814,39786,0.0,She was very negative in tone and offered no helpful advise.She took an inordinate amount of time to let me know the results of tests.  
2815,39787,0.0,"I went to Criniti for years, but really got tired of her listening to my heart and lungs, then scooting out of the room before I could ask any questions.  She really did not help my ailments, just laughed them off.   Finally switched docs and the dfference is like night and day! "
2816,39788,1.0,Dr. Casas has been my cardiologist since 2002. He recommended bypass surgery and oversaw my care after the surgery. I believe he saved my life. He is very busy and often called out on emergencies but has always taken time with me to discuss any concerns I may have. I have absolute confidence in Dr. Casas. The only problem I have ever had is that he occasionally cancels or postpones appointments on short notice because of emergency call outs.  
2817,39789,1.0,Been my personal doc for about 4 years now.  Very insightful and helpful.  Even took time when we were heading out of the country to go over everything we needed to be concerned about.  Also came in when we forgot to get a signed waiver for scuba diving and filled it out.  Never a bad experience. 
2818,39789,1.0,"Dr. Carico was one of the Doctor's who provided care for my Father.  He was a patient in Cornerstone Hospital of Hungtington.  He spent a week as the Doctor working that floor.  My father was there and Doctor Carico saw him daily.  The treatment from Dr. Carico and Cornerstone Hospital was absolutely dismal.  The decision was made to transport him out back to the Hospital he came from.  Dr. Carico told us, the family, he had contacted all the carriers.  We needed Life Flight.  He did not.  He even went home at 5:00 p.m. without calling Life Air who had been waiting 2 hours.  Afterwards, we received, after paying $193, my Dad's Medical file.  There are things in there that Dr. Carico put that aren't true.  He is horrible.  Doesn't provide all the options.  Instead, tells you that &quot;sometimes you just need to step out of the way of nature&quot;.  With little help from him, my Father passed away on April 10, 2010.  I would never recommend Dr. Carico to anyone.  "
2819,39789,1.0,"Truly not my defination of a doctor He does not have the ability to deal with serious illnesses,hes unprofessional  and rude in my opinion, when a dr gets up in someones face arguing, thats not professional by anyones standards, I filed an official complaint against him,NOW that I refuse to go to him none of the other Dr's will take me(its a rule you cant switch Drs for any reason once you start seeing one there, Id honestly wouldnt go to that Dr is he was the only one with a cure. Disgraceful that Drs arent held to higher standard in professional care.  "
2820,39789,1.0,Dr. Carico was so thoughtful and kind and very insightful.  He took his time and asked me lots of questions and I felt like he truly cared about my healthcare needs.  I would highly recommend him to family and friends.  He even called me back with my lab results and explained each one to me!  He was so kind.  
2821,39790,2.0,Excellent Knowledgeable person with loads of hand on experience 
2822,39791,0.0,"Dr. Capelle has been following my osteopenia for several years.  Every two years I have had a bone density test.   Have had three over a period of six years.  After the results of each test come in, I always want to know how each result compares with the one before and if the Actonel which I take is indeed working.   Never have gotten a straight answer, just have been told to stay on the treatment course.  After this last time, I mentioned  to my family doctor that I had no idea what was going on with my bone density tests, and that results had never been gone over with me.  He looked up the results at the MGH Radiology dept. and we learned that my bone density had gotten worse.  He ordered a vit. D level and it was found to be low "
2823,39791,0.0,"did not see the doctor about my concerns, but the nurse practioner holly was wonderful, followed up on every test and got answers to the questions i asked about.  did not probe into anything deeper, but satisfied my needs "
2824,39791,0.0,"In reading over some of the comments I find it hard to believe I was visiting the same doctor.  I found Dr. Cappella smart, attentive, and supportive.  She answered my questions and supported all of my questions.  Her staff were fine and cheerful.  I had a 15 minute wait.  I do not find her blunt. I find her to be busy and says what needs to be said.  I was treated well.  This is an excellent physician.  "
2825,39791,0.0,Surgery was 2 1/2 hours late.Paperwork did not match surgery.Items were added that had not been discussed.Dr. was rude and very egotistcal in hospital before and after surgery. I will not be returning for followup visit. Plan to change drs.immediatly. Have not received bill from dr.at this time..  
2826,39791,0.0,"When I attempted to ask educational questions, Dr. Capelle told me she was the doctor and for me to just leave myself in her care.  Has surgery she punctured my bladder and talked to my mother and husband after procedure and made it like no BIG deal.  Talked down to my family.  I ended up doing follow-up with another doctor. Could tell several more horror stories...  Run Away FAST.  "
2827,39791,0.0,"All of my concerns were addressed in a complete and professional manner.  No delays in treatment, didn't have to wait months for procedures, prompt responses on test results.  Dr. Capelle is rather blunt but it woke me up about the importance of my health and my responsibility to maintain a healthy lifestyle.  "
2828,39791,0.0,"I have never been so insulted by an MD in my life.  Dr. Capelle showed no interest in helping me with my problems and actually scolded me for taking notes during one of our appointments. Needless to say that was our final appointment. She didn't contact me about test results, only seemed interested in pushing a contraception method that did not meet my criteria nor address my concerns.  She and the pharmaceutical company for Mirena must be good friends.  On top of that, two different sets of tests/lab work performed at different times and sent to different locations both sent me bills because her staff failed to provide them my insurance information.  When I tried to resurect some level of patient/physician relationship with her and get my issues resolved, I was told there isn't a &quot;magic pill&quot; and that we as women - including her - just &quot;have to deal with it.&quot;  If you need a gyno, do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.  "
2829,39792,0.0,"My girlfriend has been seeing this &quot;Dr&quot; as well, and the words from the previous commentor &quot;dont care&quot;, is about the feeling she got from her as well as along with just &quot;mean&quot;...when she broke down in her office on last vist beacuse how much she is either dealing with absolutley no emotions at all, OR anger, depression, saddness, loss of empathy &amp; sex drive, poor sleep, no energy, no joy in life, etc, ect...my GF says she was emphatic about how bad she was feeling, like a ghost or an empty shell of herself...the &quot;so called&quot; professional advice she recived was to get out more, be around people, bright colors and lots of sunshine...it is January in the Valley now of course, lol!  When I relayed this experince to my Mother, a Nurse of 20 yrs with 2 good frinds who have both had their Thyroids removed and are to this day on hormone therapy, the response was all the same...that is COMPLETE BS, at best horrible medical advice in this case, and boderline malpractice in my opinion.Lastvisit4us "
2830,39792,0.0,"Dr. Crisan would not continue to see me past my first visit if I did not switch to the medication she prescribes for all of her thyroid patients, regardless of my telling her that I tried that medication for over two years with nasty side effects and a low quality of life.  She did not provide any reason for me to switch medications other than that it worked for everybody else and that my blood tests might not be as accurate.  However, the medication I am currently on has given me a good quality of life and I feel much better.  I reiterated this to her several times, but she did not care.  Sorry, those aren't good enough reasons for me to switch, and I found it shocking that she was not willing to work with me at all solely based upon which medication I was taking for my thyroid.  "
2831,39793,0.0,I agree with the previous post!! She is wonderful. I have been seeing her since I left my pediatrician!! I am now 20 years old. I hardly ever have to recap and go over all of my problems when I go in each and every time. She remembers everything and is always on point. Very gentle and informative.  I highly recommend her! 
2832,39793,0.0,"Dr. Castaldo is very caring and thorough.  She takes the time necessary to ensure quality care, even calling you at home if she needs to.  She really seems to &quot;know&quot; her patients. "
2833,39794,1.0,"I took my 3 boys (ages 3,2,and 7wks) to see him. My 2 yr old hadn't had a nap so he was a little roudy and was getting my 3 yr old roudy also, nothing major they were just being normal kids. When Dr. Chowdhury was telling me about scheduling my next appointment he told me to schedule them all seperate and not bring them all together. He wasn't interested in the children at all. He acted very improfessional and was very rude. "
2834,39795,2.0,"great doc,really caring.was my husband's doc.immediate diagnosis,immediate treatment plan "
2835,39796,2.0,Was very caring and compassionate while showing good knowledge. 
2836,39797,0.0,"She is my favorite doctor.  Period.  If I could rate her off the chart, I would.  Knowledgeable, superb skill, talented, empathetic. I rarely see doctors and do not normally look forward to doctor visits.  I looked forward to seeing her.  I miss her.  "
2837,39797,0.0,"Dr. C is absolutely terrific.  Very sympatico, and she gets to the problem.  She ensures you have all the right check ups, tests, etc. I haven't felt this comfortable with a Dr. in a long time.  "
2838,39798,0.0,"Carrying on a family tradition, ( her father and mother were both MDs) this lady is remarkable, caring and really &quot;knows&quot; each of her patients.  You never feel like &quot;just another number.&quot; You can feel the personal concern and care coming from Dr. Cavender. If you experience a wait in her office, feel good about it.  She will take the necessary time with you also and not rush you through.  "
2839,39799,2.0,". Very caring,easy to talk to knowledgeable "
2840,39800,0.0,Dr. Cash was so very helpful and kind. I usually hate going to doctors because they act like it's an inconvenience that you are there. I'm 24 and this was my first regular doctor. I will definitely follow up with her. She chatted with my for about 30 minutes instead of rushing me out of the office and even pulled up pictures on her computer to show me what she thought was wrong to put it into better perspective. Extremely nice and would recommend.  
2841,39801,1.0,"Dr. Cobb is an excellent dentist.  With a past history of bad experiences in the dental chair, I was relieved to find a dentist who understood this and was very patient with me.  His technique for numbing prior to a procedure is remarkable.  I can honestly say, I felt very little discomfort with the actual injection and nothing while he performed the procedure.  He explained each step of the procedure and made sure I was comfortable and pain free.  This dentist has ended all fears I ever experienced in the past.  I highly recommend him to anyone who wants to find a compassionate, caring and excellent young dentist.  "
2842,39802,2.0,not very helpful 
2843,39803,1.0,"I love this dentist.  He is knowledgable, professional and his staff is great too!  The office is always clean and they have all the latest technology there. My entire family goes to this office as well.  They are competitively priced and have excellent service. I definitely recommend this doctor to anyone looking for dental care. "
2844,39803,1.0,"Bad experience with this dentist. I was involved with him for 10 months during this time. Front top teeth were filed down very short, then a 2 piece temporary cover made and applied by his dental assistant. Raw nerves were exposed and I has painful shocking like pain with eating and drinking anything. An upper left tooth was drilled until the tooth exploded into bits. I caused me 2,000 dollars to save, at my cost. When I picked my records up, this incident or entire visit was not documented. The assistant had made the 2 piece temporary, Dr. Carpenter laughed. Right top crown was set too low causing the gum to recede and look bad, this then caused the precision fitting partial not to fit, and caused sharp pain with chewing. This was not documented in my file either. I was never issued anything for pain. The work I needed done would change from one visit to another. I thought I could handle it but I was wrong.  "
2845,39803,1.0,Dr. Carpenter does not have time to see his patients if there is an emergency.  He also has no loyality to his patients when they have been long term patients

2849,39805,1.0,Dr. Paul is very friendly and takes the time to answer any questions. The staff is mostly friendly but some can be a bit impolite. Things tend to not be kept confidential in the Valley Health Fort Gay office. I would recommend Dr. Paul to anyone seeking a family doctor.

2851,39807,1.0,"I highly recommend Dr. Jason Castle; on a scale of 1-10, he's an 11.  I've needed dual knee replacements for over 10 years (my dual ACL reconstructions from the early 80's lasted me for almost 20 years).  Reasons for my rating:  a) he was straighforward and open in his evaluation; covered options, risks, possible benefits; b) well-organized staff that was accurate, prompt and professional, c) my dual knee replacement went so well that my pain was less the day AFTER surgery than the day BEFORE surgery, i was home 2 days after surgery, no need for a walker 1 week after surgery (per both therapists and myself), driving after 2-1/2 weeks, walking a mile plus after 3 weeks and able to resume all the activities i had to give up over the past 15 years (bicycling, trail hiking, jogging, etc).  I cannot imagine a better experience for dual knee replacements. "

2861,39841,1.0, Dr. Ellis has been my doctor for 16 years. He has become a member of my family. He saved my vision and possibly more since he had recognized complaints i was having as a possibly more complicated problem. I found out i had a chiari malformation after something he heard just wasnt right. He is the best doctor i have EVER had and recommend him to everyone! 
2862,39845,1.0," Dr. Edwards is a God send. For the longest time, I kept having really bad abdominal pain that kept flaring up. Everytime that I went to the emergency room they told me it was just rupturing cyst on my ovaries. Dr. Edwards took the time to explain everything, listen to every concern I had, and check up on my. My finacee was very happy too because for the first time in over 3 years I was able to live my life pain free.

He ran test on me to find out what was going on. I appreciated that he listened to my concerns and took action. I will also say he is the most excited Dr.over your pregnancy I have ever known. He shares intimate joys that you never forget with him.  The first time I saw my sons heartbeat he seemed as excited as I was. There is a magic to Dr.Edwards. I think it is because he has a heart for women.

2869,39846,0.0," She and her nurse were both very arrogant and condescending.  The interminable wait on several visits were inexcusable, and when challenged I was made to feel like I was unappreciative.  I usually respect those in the medical profession very much, but Dr. Epstein and her nurse were ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE...isn't there a rating less than 1.0&#63; "
2870,39846,0.0, This doctor that my husband went to for severe back pain looked at his eyes and noticed that they were bloodshot seeing as how he doesn't sleep because pain.

2876,39855,1.0, He does not tell the truth.  He performs surgeries that he is not competent in doingl.  
2877,39855,1.0, Dr. Ellington is the greatest.  He delivered my twins and took wonderful care of me the entire time.  I could not recommend a better doctor.  
2878,39855,1.0, I have been with Dr. Ellington for about 4 years now. I am pregnant with my second child and drive an hour to still see him because I trust him so much. I have recommended him to many friends and family and everyone has always been happy with his services.

2884,39861,1.0," THE BEST, SEEN MANY SURGONS BEFRE MAKING A DICISION, BACKS SHOULD NOT BE TAKEN LIGHTLY,HE IS MOST KNOWLEGABLE AND TAKES TIME TO EXPLAIN YOUR CONDIDITION, SHOWS YOU ALL YOUR FILMS, TALKS TO YOU IN A WAY YOU TOTALLY UNDERSTAND.I DRIVE 4 HOURS TO SEE HIM. WELL WORTH IT.  "
2885,39861,1.0," I like that he tells you like it is. His office staff generally are not nice, nor are they very helpful and he is rarely on time. However, he has done 2 surgeries on my husband and is getting ready to do a 3rd. Of all of the doctors we have seen over the past 12 years (too many to count), Dr. Emery is by far my favorite. He listens to what you have to say and responds in a way that you can understand. Does not only explain, but shows you on your films and with models what he is talking about. I would recommend anyone with spinal problems to him.  "
2886,39864,1.0, Most caring and knowledgable ER doctor I have ever met!!  Trauma skill is outstanding!  Saved my family members life!!! 
2887,39864,1.0," While pregnant he has been the friendliest doctor. He its wonderful! His office is nice, clean, and well maintained. They office staff are all friendly very knowledge and all around the best experience ever.  "

2889,39867,2.0," The treatment use only made my condition worst and they attempted to giving me 15 more treatments, which I refused. "
2890,39871,1.0," Today was my first experience with Dr. Brett Eckley and I am very pleased. He was friendly and explained everything perfectly. He was able to answer my questions. I am looking so forward to my experience there. The staff was friendly and inviting. They really make you feel right at home in their office. I will recommend him to anyone I know needing orthodontic work, and I will take my three children there. "
2891,39871,1.0," Dr. Eckley had trouble explaining how he would fix my son's teeth.  He had to ask his dad, which also had trouble. "
2892,39871,1.0, This office is so friendly. They treat you like a member of the family. I am putting all three of my children through braces with the Eckleys and their great staff! Paid/Co-pay:$4500
2893,39875,1.0, He is VERY kind &amp; knows exactly what he's doing. He's just wonderful! 
2894,39882,2.0,  
2895,39886,1.0, very professional and courteous. Both my wife and I went to see him on the saME DAY AS NEW PATIENTS AND WE WERE BOTH IMPRESSED. wE ATRE IN OUr 60's. we know good doctors when we see one.  
2896,39886,1.0," Very rude, not intuitive. Office smelled of urine. Had to wait over an hour.  "
2897,39896,1.0," I had my third child by csection, I would NEVER refer him to anyone.. My child had a spontaneous Phenothorax before birth, hyponosis lack of o2 all kinds of problems he was diagnosed with Partial Complex seizure Disorder 2 years ago..  I am now filing a Malpractice lawsuit against him.. My son was delivered in 2008 the first baby since he left an went to Flordia in early 2000 stimming from a lawsuit for delivering a baby by csection which he took fingers off.    He is always in a panic, a rush, I had Dr Brodnik for my previous two an should of returned!! "
2898,39896,1.0, Dr Eshel let my 2nd child die and  did so much damage delivering my third child that I had a lot of surgeries afterward. I had a bad time. He did not repair me after I gave birth and it messed up my bowels and all. I lost all control of body functions. You want to talk about a bad life. And if he would have listened my second child might not have died. 
2899,39896,1.0, He is a total jerk and enjoys making rude and crude remarks to patients and his own staff 
2900,39896,1.0," Dr. Eshel, was my doctor for the first 7 months of my pregnancy. I changed the last two months because I could no longer take his rude remarks. I left his office crying each visit. He would not tell us the sex of our baby only remark &quot;it's a baby&quot; and he was just extremely arrogant and rude. I found a much better Dr. and am extremely happy that I switched. I have learned from him, that you never let someone treat you like this professional or not. I was a young first time mother and once told him that I had a tooth bothering me and if it would be alright if I go to the dentist and he said &quot;why haven't you already been!!&quot; Also I was about 40lbs over weight half way through and he kept telling me that I needed to lose weight before I had the baby. Not the kind of experience I ever want to relive.  "
2901,39896,1.0," Dr.  Eshel is a wonderful doctor, he just doesn't take out enough time to deal with his patients, He sometimes will do a scan for 5 seconds and your out after waiting 2 hours to get in! I think service should be better and he should take out more time for his patients! "
2902,39896,1.0," Dr.Eshel is a super Ob/Gyn. I cannot ever say enough good things about him or his office staff. He birthed all 3 of my children. He is one of those great doctors that actually take the time to explain things out for you. Never did I feel as though I was just another patient coming through the doors. I now live in Colorado, and have yet to find any doctor that lives up to my expectations, Dr. Eshel ruined it for all of them :) "
2903,39896,1.0, i really liked him and so did my husband 
2904,39896,1.0, Too busy with personal things to worry about his patience. 
2905,39896,1.0,  
2906,39898,1.0, Extremely knowledgable and helpful who took the time with me to discuss my problems.  Not sure what the other rater was talking about.  He is trained as both an internal medicine doctor and a psychiatrist and provided excellent help in managing my pain related to my cancer. 
2907,39898,1.0, I found this Doctor not helpful and he concurred with a young Doctor on something that he had no personal knowledge about. The young Doctor lied and Dr. Elswick did nothing to help clarify the situation.  
2908,39903,1.0," Dr.Eastone treated my father and I thought he was a very nice doctor until the day came that I had a compliant about him being out of town for the weekend and having no back-up doctor to treat my father at St. Mary's Hospital He then became very rude and down right childish. The way he spoke to my father and I was a disgrace to the medical profession. I don't think it's unreasonable to ask that there be a doctor on call instead of letting a patient sit in the hospital for 3 days just waiting around for a doctor. I'm sure the insurance company would be happy to know they paid for 3 days hospital stay when he could have been released and sent home. Among the many hurtful things he said to me, when I ask if he was sure that my father only had a bleeding ulcer and nothing more serious (since no test were done) he said &quot;Well if you would like he to open him back up and take a look and put him through all that pain and misery just to prove me right, I'll do that for you&quot; Very uncalled for.  "
2909,39903,1.0," great bedside manner, very thorough, very personable and caring...highly recommended. "
2910,39903,1.0, This Dr saw my husband in the hospital and he was just wonderful. He listened - really listened and explained everything.  First Dr who listened w respect to my comments and questions Appeared very knowledgable 
2911,39903,1.0, Dr. Eastone is wonderful. He explains all medical tests and conditions. He draws detailed diagrams and explains whats going on. He even called me at home to see how I was doing. Friendly and professional.  
2912,39904,1.0," Dr Ede is very informative, spends time with his patience, cares..great surgeon, great followup care. I would recommend him to everyone in need.  "
2913,39904,1.0," Dr Ede is terrific, as is the majority of the staff in the office.  However, Lydia can be very unhelpful when she puts her mind to it - and as the keepr of the gate has much power. "
2914,39904,1.0," This guy is fantastic: great bedside manner, answers all questions from all family members.  Asks if you have any questions.  Actually cares about his patients as people, not just paychecks.  THANKS, Dr.  Ede! "
2915,39905,1.0, Neglected my father when in was in the hospital. Didn't provide the necessary care. Too quick to prescribe medication. 
2916,39905,1.0, excellent very caring.  Goes above and beyond to see to it that my family is well taken care of.  
2917,39905,1.0, My family is saddened that Dr. Emch can no longer retain us since we moved away from New Martinsville.  I have yet to find a replacement.  He listens to you and explores all avenues of diagnostics &amp; treatment.   I highly recommend him and staff! 
2918,39905,1.0, Dr. Emch is a very poor doctor.  He made my wife go off of Beta blocker &quot;cold turkey&quot; instead of stepdown which I think caused an irregular heart beat  also he is a very rude person along with his staff.  I went to him for 6-7 years befor I decide it was time to leave after what he did concerning my wife.  
2919,39905,1.0," Quality was excellent.  Excellent diagnostition, Very pleased with the appointment "
2920,39905,1.0," Dr. Emch has been treating me for War Injuries and additional Health complications that arose afterwards.  I found Dr. Emch to be a very understanding individual who listen to my concerns and desire's.  Whereas all of my prior government as well as civilian doctors just wanted to put me into a wheel chair for life.  Dr. Emch listened to me, reviewed additional data and came up with a medical treatment plan that has me now Walking on my own!  I am able to see Dr Emch in a very quick manner, depending on my health condition - i.e. basic check-ups to very severe medical issues flair up - depends on the condition.  The longest wait I ever had for a basic routine check-up was 5 days! For severe medical condition flair up, IMMEDIATELY - same day!  I would recommend Dr. Emch to anyone.  "
2921,39905,1.0, DR. EMCH DOES NOT PAY GOOD ATTENTION TO PAST RECORDS WHEN MAKING TREATMENT DECISIONS. DOES NOT LISTEN TO PATIENTS CONCERNS.  
2922,39907,1.0,"Gone to him my whole life, and he always goes above and beyond what he is required to do, and he is always very professional. I wouldn't trust my teeth to anyone else.  "
2923,39907,1.0,"Dr. Harshbarger is the most kind, compassionate dentist that I've ever met.  He has come in on weekends and late at night to work on my family and me.  His technology is better than anyone in the area and he makes a effort to stay educated.  His manner is one of caring and removing the fear of going to the dentist, one of the most stressful events in a person's life.  Keep up the great work Dr. Mike! "
2924,39907,1.0,The only problem i have is that he pinches my arm while working on my teeth 
2925,39907,1.0,"I had a dental implant and he messed up the crown. He filed it down to nothing and my bite if off. I kept going back to try and get it fixed, but he kept acting like I was crazy and his staff acted like I was just trying to cause trouble when I wanted was to have a functional tooth. He took impressions twice and the crown he put in had to be filed to nothing. Now I have a terrible taste in my mouth and am afraid to go to anyone else or back to him. I do not know what I am going to do. He acted impatient and short fused with me. It was a terrible experience.  "
2926,39907,1.0,"This previous post sounds insane.  I'm 100% positive that its content is a complete misrepresentation or flat out lie.  I've been treated by Dr. Harshbarger since I was a little girl as has the rest of my family.  Yes, he's interested in chatting casually and/or being friendly while treating patients, no that does not make him a creep as the previous poster would have you believe.  He or she clearly has a vendetta because a tooth that had to be filled had to be removed later.  This is not unheard of.  It amazes me when people use the internet as a way to defame the character of others with no accountability, and its nothing short of cyber bullying.  What's next, accusing your dry cleaner of assault because he couldn't get the spot out of your shirt&#63; "
2927,39907,1.0,"I've been coming to Mike since I was a kid, so I know him and his practice very well. My wife, four children and I work with orphans in the bush of Africa, so we only make it back to the States every couple of years. Mike and his staff go OUT OF THEIR WAY to get us all in there quickly, showing great care and concern for our dental needs. His staff is kind, caring, and genuinely interested in us. They are professional, yet very friendly~ what you hope to find in a West Virginia practice! My young children LOVE Mike, as he is wonderful at loosening them up, making them laugh, and providing them a very positive dental experience. Mike treats my wife and I with care and respect, something I am always so thankful for. He works hard to stay up to date on the latest technology and practices, is very knowledgeable, funny (yet professional), and he works both thoroughly and quickly (something I'm always thankful for!). I would highly recommend Mike and his staff to anyone. "
2928,39907,1.0,"An old-fashioned dentist who keeps up on modern dentistry.  I once told him my spouse had an infected tooth that was &quot;killing him&quot;.  Dr. Mike's response, &quot;How long will it take you to get to the office&#63;&quot;  If he runs behind, it is because he is working in dental emergencies.  His medical staff is great.  His receptionist is so rude and bad, that I once said if I had not been coming to his office over 30 years, I'd never have gone back.  Dr. Mike now allows payments on time.  You don't have to pay it all at once.  Once a week he donates time at nursing home.  From a family of doctors, he did not get out of VietNam service.  He is a combat Veteran and comes from a fine old West/Virginia family.  3 generations of his family have been treating 5 generations of my family.  SUPER GREAT DENTIST~!!!!! "
2929,39907,1.0,Great doctor whom is always helpful in anyway! Always keeps you laughing and feeling good (although when does it feel good to go to the dentist). I never know when he puts the needle in to numb and I like that because I don't like needles. 
2930,39908,2.0,Dr Craig was very personable and explained everything in great detail. I had a good experience. 
2931,39909,1.0,"Excellent, caring Dr. I moved to NC and really miss the medical care he gave. "
2932,39909,1.0,"Dr. Hanna is my mom (and was my dad's doctor).  He is the the kindest, most compassionate, caring doctor I have ever seen.  I can not begin to say enough about the &quot;EXCELLENT&quot; care he has provided to my parents.  I would recommend him to anyone.  He is a good Christian man.  "
2933,39909,1.0,"He doesn't listen to any concerns, then rushes you out the room after five minutes. This is after you have sat in the waiting room for 2 hours. He obviously overbooks himself, which I find very greedy. If you have a continuing pain, he will assure you you're fine...until you end up in the ER 9 months later! Either an idiot or just doesn't care...either way, I would give him a .001 star out of 5. "
2934,39909,1.0,"He admitted my mother to the hospital with an acute abdomen and failed to follow up with her thru the night. She was misdiagnosed by radiology and even though her symptoms progressively got worse, he did not bother to find out what was going on with her. She died a horrible death due to his lack of concern.  "

2940,39914,1.0,. Need better timing 
2941,39915,1.0,Dr. Hanley is awesome. I can really tell he cares about me and all aspects of my treatment. He is the best psychiatrist in the area. I have seen most others. His staff is tremendous as well.  He even makes personal telephone calls when warranted! 
2942,39915,1.0,He is a very caring psychiatrist that genuinely want to help his patients.  
2943,39916,1.0,Great doctor. At fifteen my bowels ruptured. He did amazing work and made me and my family feel very good about everything we were going through. Very friendly! Would recommened to anyone. 
2944,39917,1.0,"Dr. Hunter has delivered all 3 of my children.  He has been my gynecologist for 20+ years.  He may not look you directly in the eye, but believe it or not he has a fantastic sense of humor!  He is a wealth of knowledge on every topic I've ever asked.  I love the fact that every time I go to my prenatal visits, I actually see HIM and not a handful of physician assistants.  Without reservation, I would recommend Dr. Hunter to anyone! "
2945,39917,1.0,"I have been going to Dr. Hunter for twelve years and he delivered both of my children.  He is an excellant OB/GYB.  I had to have an hysterectomy 3 years ago and all went remarkably well.  I was only 32 and Dr. Hunter took great care of me, you couldn't ask for a better man.  He's a little shy but thats kinda nice to find in a doctor.  "
2946,39917,1.0,If you are looking for a OB that is on time - you'll never find one!  Babies don't come on a schedule and when I deliver I want my Dr. with me - not in his office - so I don't hold punctuality against him.  He can't help most of it!  He is very sweet and thorough.  I had many complications during and after my pregnancy and he and his staff have always been very helpful and considerate!  I wouldn't go to anyone else!!!!! 
2947,39917,1.0,

2950,39917,1.0,"I truly appreciate Dr. Hunter and his staff. The staff are very friendly and responsive and work hard to accommodate my schedule. Although busy, Dr. Hunter takes the time to answer any questions or discuss test results without making me feel like I'm &quot;on the clock. &quot; "
2951,39917,1.0,Dr. Hunter delivered my son 3 years ago. I moved to WV 6 months into my pregnancy & he took over. At first I was concerned with having a male Dr. b/c I had always seen a women OB/GYN I found Dr. Hunter to be knowledgeable and thorough. His staff is very kind and I never felt rushed or dismissed. On more than one occasion I spent almost an hour waiting for my appointment and I do believe that they could do better with their promptness and scheduling. But I never questioned my care and would not hesistate to recommend him.  
2952,39917,1.0,Did not care for this doctor. He was not helpful with questions and did not explain anything to me. He would not look me in the eye. 
2953,39918,1.0,Dr.Hagan is one of three allergy doctors in huntington. This  guy is one of the best. Go to him!!!! 
2954,39919,1.0,"I think Dr. Hatfield is the best dentist there is, period. I have been to him several times and I have felt NO pain. He stands behind his work and using far superior materials to other dentists. He will tell you if you need something or not, and he is not in the business of ripping his patients off. He is wonderful and I will continue using him as long as he is practicing!!! "
2955,39920,1.0,"Dr. Haffar is very intelligent and has a wonderful bedside manner.  He does a thourough examination and then decides what tests to run.  He does not run useless tests just to bill insurance.  He explains everything and speaks excellent English.   Thank you, Dr. Haffar and thanks to your pleasant office staff.  "
2956,39921,1.0,Would not go to him again if he paid me.  very uncaring doctor.  He was rude and rough.  And his office could use some updates 
2957,39921,1.0,"They do things they know your insurance wont pay for and dont tell you. Like Using white fillings on back teeth instead of metal. 90% of insurance Co's wont pay that. But they dont tell you when they do it, or give you the option of not getting the white fillings. Then, a Month later, you'll get a bill for the remainder of what your insurance co. wont pay.  Very sneaky if you ask me.  "
2958,39921,1.0,He is the best dentist I have ever had. 
2959,39922,1.0,"Dr. Honaker saved my Dad's life by correctly diagnosing a problem not related to his field of medicine, but by taking time to listen to him and referring him to a doctor that could help.   He is wonderful! "

2961,39922,1.0,. very unhelpful staff and the doctor is forgetful 
2962,39922,1.0,"Several years ago I had went to several different doctors for severe pain I had in my left side that would come and go and had x-rays, and several tests. The doctors told me that nothing was wrong with me. Finally after 3 years of severe pain, I started bleeding when I went to emergency room, I had lost almost half of my blood volume ,they told me I needed a specialist and which one did I want I said I didn't know any, and they told me Dr. Honaker was on call, so I said he was fine with me. Within what seemed like minutes he diagnosed what my problem was and the next day I went to surgery, and began treatments for Ulcerative Colotis and Crohn's.  "
2963,39923,0.0,This woman was not helpful at all. She did not recognize how seriously ill and over-medicated I was. She also discouraged me from seeking financial assistance. Not very knowledgeable and NOT an M.D. psychiatrist either. Avoid.  
2964,39924,1.0,"I have to see one of the physician assistants when I go to the drop in clinic because Dr Holbert is goofing off in his office. I waited for him two hours one day and walked by his office to see him online playing a game. He has little empathy for his patients and works at the clinic to bring in the bacon and nothing else. Doctors in West Virginia seem to be all about ego, power, and money, and Dr Holbert is a good example of this. He has a poor attitude. Doctors are taking a lot of money from society and giving very little back. They are causing the economy to be fragile. Doctors take too much money out of the pockets of hard working people.  "
2965,39925,1.0,I have been going to Dr. Henson for several years. He is a great doctor. He has always taken the time to answer all my questions and concerns.  His staff has always been very helpful.

2978,39929,1.0,Why doesn''t this doctor care about the average working man&#63; Why doesn''t his ego allow him to see the pain that exists in his patients&#63; 
2979,39930,1.0,He's arrogant with no bedside manner.  Hate to see he is now at Pearisburg Hospital.  
2980,39930,1.0,"I had a fracture of the left hand below the  Metacarpal but right at the joint. From the x-rays very little if any arthritis was seen as per ER Dr. I told Helvey the pain in the joint was 10 on level of 10 he ignored me over and over I complained, on deaf ears. I now have a severely protruding joint. And I ‘m left handed. I can’t open a jar. I drop things, and even holding a pen is painful.  Being physical therapy for months with my shoulder I had the chance to talk to a lot of people. And the ones that saw Helvey or the other Dr. of Orthopedics at the office are still kicking themselves. And will never go back…. I suggest you research your Dr. extensively.  "

2984,39931,0.0,"this doctor is a pill pusher, she does not even examine her patients, and gives them whatever they ask for, alot of young people are dying because of her. All she wants is money! I took my brother there after a car accident the office was packed some people waiting were pilled up so bad they were falling out of chairs and slurring speech. After my brother came out I ask him how it went and he said all she ask was what meds did I want, and set him up at her phy therapy site to run up his pip. It was outragous!! When the pip was gone she dropped him as a paitent. She needs to be investigated! "
2985,39932,1.0,I saw Dr. Hagins for the first time today. I was in an accident and have seen numerous doctors over the last 6 years. I can honestly say that my experience was one of the best I have had. He took his time to listen to what was wrong and I didnt feel like he was on a time schedule or that I was just a number. Not only did he listen to me but also took the time to explain treatments. I highly recommend Dr. Hagins and the staff. Also I didnt make it through the first page of a gossip magazine before I was called back.  Great experience.  
2986,39932,1.0,"Not great hours,you have to be there at 6 a.m. or no later then 10a.m.But he does listen and gives you opitions in your treatment.If you don't have insurance office vists start at 90.00 a little high for many.Overall good Dr. good staff "

2990,39935,2.0,". excellent, excellent best care fast and friendly "
2991,39936,1.0,"I Liked Dr. Honakers personality WHEN you can get him to talk. He would answer any questions that I had but didnt offer much. He also didnt seem to remember me from visit to visit. He listened to me but I still felt as though he had 'his hand on the doorknob' throughout our visits. My biggest complaint is that he missed my leaking amniotic fluid for 2 months, saying it was &quot;normal&quot; and not checking anything. My little one came 2 months early because of it.  "
2992,39936,1.0,"Dr. Honaker is amazing. He is very compassionate and made me feel very comfortable.  Very knowledgeable. I trust him completely and would recommend him to anyone looking for a great OB doc! I wish I had gone to him for the delivery of our first son, because his personality made all the difference in the world! "
2993,39937,1.0,"I have been going to Dr. Holehouse for 3 years and I trust him more than any other doctor. Him and his wife, Jennifer, have ALWAYS been there for me and have always went beyond what any other doctor would do for their patients! I LOVE THEM! "
2994,39937,1.0,"well, i am fifteen year's old, and having a baby. My mother took me to Dr. Holehouse due to the fact, he was my doctor. he is sweet as pie in my eye's. he has made me a steady appointment for every month and he call's to check up before the appointment. he gave me and my mother the best advice we heard throughout the whole process, &quot;make the best of it&quot;. Holehouse became ad MD because he is the bed of his kind, no doubt, but i wonder how people can blame him for misscarriage's or anything along those line's. it's not his fault. he didn't call God and tell him not to keep the baby full term, he simply does his best in everything he does. if God decide's be need's the baby in heaven and not on earth, that is up to none of us, except him. i hate hearing bad thing's about Dr. Holehouse, he truly is a fabulous man. you just have to understand where he is coming from, he has done this for a long time so he know's what he is doing. "
2995,39937,1.0,I called them and told them i was bleeding and having cramps and they told me everything was normal. so i didnt think anything of it. the next morning when i wake up the cramps were alil worst so i call them again which they never didnt call me back i ended up call them like 5 times before someone answered. then they had me on hold for over 30 mins and finally told me to come in and still had to wait there an hour before they took me back. and dr. jennifer holehouse does an ultra sound look for like a min and tells me i had a miscarrage. and just leaves the room without saying anything else. so when i was leaving i asked her since i was bleed what should i use and she told me i could use tampons. which i find out later from family and friends that ur never suppose 2 use tampon after u had a baby or a miscarrage. so i dont think they really know what the are talking about.  
2996,39937,1.0,"Dr. Holehouse is very nice and easy to talk to. He was able to find what was wrong with me from just one look when for over 6 years no other OB/GYN could figure out. He works with his wife, Jennifer Holehouse; CNM and Cindy Brown; CNM. They are all very professional and courteous. There office is called West Preston Womens Health. If it wasn't for him I wouldn't have my beautiful baby boy. He is also the first to discover that I wasn't ovulating. From before you become pregnant to after the baby is born they take really good care of you. The staff is very helpful and friendly and when you leave a message they try to get back with you the same day, if not by the next day you will hear from them. I gave them a good rating because they have always been very good to me.  "

2998,39939,1.0,"This is not a review of Doctor Hurst but rather his front office staff. The individuals that I spoke to at the front office were very unprofessional and I am not sure if they are playing with a full deck. Based on this experience I will not return to this office nor will I recommend this office to my colleagues, friends or family.Very disappointing not a way to run a business.  "
2999,39939,1.0,"Doctor and staff were fine, but the billing office staff were rude and short-tempered.  After receiving one bill, I received a second bill with a handwritten note stating that they had contacted me numerous times and if they didn't receive payment they would send me to collections. I sent a letter to the attention of the doctor with a payment for the full amount owed stating I had not been contacted numerous times, only once before the the second notice and I didn't appreciate the rude handwritten message on the bill and that I would make sure to tell anyone who needed a dermatologist to not go to Dr. Hurst because of his staff. Obviously, the doctor never saw the letter and I received another letter from the office that was rude.  "
3000,39939,1.0,Very warm and friendly environment. The staff and Dr Hurst was friendly and welcoming. He was attentive and interested in our concerns. He answered questions with knowledge and care.

3005,39942,0.0,"I went to Dr. George because it is important to me to find a female doctor that I feel comfortable with. Dr. George definately fit the bill! She is young and seems very compassionate, understanding and knowledgable. She has a great bedside manner and really took the time to listen. I felt at ease talking with her. Unfortunately, I only got to see her the one time because she left the practice. I would love to know where she went so I could still be a patient. Even though my insurance did not participate with her former group, I would have continued to go because I felt that comfortable with her.  "
3006,39942,0.0,Loved her.  She took the time to get to know me and talk to me.  But she left the practice where I originally saw her.   Can someone tell me where she is practicing now&#63;

3010,39943,1.0,"Dr Herrmann has always seemed friendly and answered every question that I ever posed to him.  He has was first treating me for ED, later discovered I was hypogonadal and then discovered a pituitary adenoma which was the cause of my other two issues.  He was quick to recognize that he was not an expert in this field and set up a follow up appointment with a specialist.  I respect the man for that.  "
3011,39943,1.0,"My husband doctored with doctor Heerman for several years.  In 99 he started experiencing some chest pain and difficulty breathing.  He was on Lipator for high cholesterol at this time.  With out doing any testing Dr. H told him he had allergies and prescribed allery medicine.  On subsiquent visits the diagnosis was always the same, no allergy testing, no ekg, stress test or any other testing was ever orderd for him  In 04 I asked my Dr. to see my husband.  He did an ekg and referred him to a cardiologist for a stress test this was on 3/26/04, on 4/18 he had a heart cath and on 4/19 he had quadruple by pass for 6 blockages.  Some of the allery meds he had prescribed for him should not have even been taken by someone with heart problems. The lord was looking out for my husband but his doctor surley was not.  "
3012,39943,1.0,When my daughter was 15 she had her gall bladder removed by another doctor who was a surgeon. My daughter was still have in pain after the surgery. Dr. Herrmann was her primary care giver and choose to have a phyciatrist evaluate her. The phyciatrist said her pain was physical not mental so I asked Dr. Herrmann to refer her to Childrens Hospital in Columbus. He would not make the referal and wrote in her medical record that she had tried suicide many times and the pain was strickly mental. I obtained all of her medical records before taking her to Columbus and that is when this was information was made know. Please always obtain your medical records to know what is being reported. I have discovered that this that should have sent up a red flag was never investigated by this doctor.

3016,39945,0.0,"Overall, nice lady; however, she doesn't fully evaluate your problems to get to a solution.  She threw the usual meds to fix part of the problem, but didn't fully &quot;fix&quot; me.  There were things I knew should've been tested to R/O various diseases and/or illnesses.  I know as I do have family in the medical field, and I myself have had some training in the field.  Once she couldn't figure out what was going on, she just wrote me off as seeing me in a year for an annual.  Also went back and forth about referring me to a specialist, and wasn't going to until I mentioned other problems I was having such as bleeding.  A referral was in the works, but it never was set up apparently by her staff.  Needless to say, I'm finding another doctor.   One that will listen, and doesn't take my health for granted! "
3017,39945,0.0,Very nice young lady. She listens while you talk and does not interupt. Very thorough in her exams. Does not rush in and out of the appt.

I will return to doctor Huffman in the future for gyn visits and hopefully in the future for ob visits. She made all the right decisions concerning me and my baby. And for that I will be forever grateful to her and her staff. And the waiting room, bathroom, and entire office is very neat, and clean. Wait time isn't that bad. I only had one appointment that was a little long wait but other than that everything was great. "

3031,39952,1.0,"Dr. Humphries is never on time, and always has a student with him.  He has airy demeanor that makes him  uncomfortable to be around. I was billed 2 years late for a counselor visit for $100, which I had to pay out of pocket because Dr.'s office didn't file with my insurance company on time.  "
3032,39952,1.0,"I went to this doctor after a stay in River Park.  My first visit in his office after being hospitalized, (3 days after being released) he told me I looked familiar.  He had no clue that he had just seen me every day for an entire week, he had to sit there and read my file during my appointment to even know what I was seeing him for.  "
3033,39952,1.0,"I really like this doctor however his bedside manner could be improved. He could also be a little bit more helpful, although he does genuinly care about his patients and is showing a great deal of compassion toward me after loosing my father.  "
3034,39952,1.0,"Good personality, knowledgeable, and would trust him the most, as far as psychiatrists go (especially in Huntington, WV. At least he is a Christian.  "
3035,39953,0.0,"I saw Dr. Hornsby year ago about painful joints that would visibly swell.  Dr. Hornsby assured me that all I was describing was simply my imagination. I was 45 years old. This woman was so condescending and rude; she dismissed my complaints with questions about why I might be seeking &quot;attention.&quot; For extra insult, she sent her nurse with a Vioxx paperclip in a bag she referred to as a &quot;little purse,&quot; extended as a &quot;gift&quot; to help &quot;cheer me up.&quot; The nurse said her last instructions was, &quot;See how she likes THAT.&quot;  I was flat in tears; belittled and humiliated. I would not go back to this office unless it would be to press charges.  The rest of the staff and facility are top-notch, but as long as Joann Hornsby is at WVU rhuematology clinic, I will not be participating.  I am being treated in Charleston for Psoriatic Arthritis, Ehlers Danlos Syndrome and DISH. I am treated with respect in a team approach with my doctor and staff, in which I am part of the team.  My doc rocks! "
3036,39953,0.0,its been along time that i have been to a dr who will actually listen to me and answer all my questions. hands down the best ive seen for my RA.i drive for 3hours one way to see her and i would recommend her to anyone suffering from RA.

3038,39954,2.0,Professional and caring. Very impressed. Best doctor I've ever been too.  
3039,39955,1.0,Very long wait time. An appointment only gets you in on the day. You need to be ready to hurry up and wait. He does not accept insurance so you pay cash at time of service.  He is also very expensive $$$. 
3040,39955,1.0,You may have to wait to see him but its worth the wait. He is very experienced and confident but will send you to a specialist or for further testing if he feels its needed. 
3041,39955,1.0,The most amazing doctor one could ask for.  He has truly saved my life several times.  I wouldn't see anyone else but him. Very dedicated. 
3042,39955,1.0,"My grandmother went to William Harris for years he had her on high blood pressure meds for years one day he takes her off everything,some time later she started having mini strokes this was not known for some time later.the last time she seen him she was having a mini stroke in his office he said everything was fine my grandmother called my mother when she got home and said she almost couldn't drive home my mom went and took her to the ER and my grandmother was never the same didn't know any of us. "
3043,39955,1.0,"Very thorough, but a physical exam takes a large part of your day. Seems to be very caring.  "
3044,39956,1.0,Great dr. I have been going to him since I was 16. He makes you comfortable and he is very knowledgable.  
3045,39956,1.0,"Dr. P. Hunter is very professional and listens to any concerns you have about your body. He explains things to you so you actually understand what is wrong and his examinations are thorough yet quick. The only problems I have had would be the lack of room within the waiting area. It is usually crammed full and I have had to stand once or twice on a busy day. This is to be expected when there is more than one doctor located in the office. Depending on the amount of patients he can keep you waiting for a few minutes in the room but he makes up for it by paying full attention to you and your needs the moment he walks through the door. Overall, I feel that Dr. Hunter is very respectful, caring, and completely knowledgeable as well as pleasant to speak with.  "
3046,39957,2.0,"Not at all happy with this place, would not ever go there again for any reason.  Horrible, horrible experience. "
3047,39959,1.0,"I had a very high risk pregnancy due to diabetes, high BP, and incompetent cervix and had to have a cerclage put in at 12 weeks.  I could not have ask for a better dr.  He is polite, listens, and very good manners.  He does not send you for unneccessary testing that worries the life out of you, but if needed will do so.  I have already recommended him to 2 women and they love him also.  He goes out of his way to see HIS patients if you are in the hospital or are delivering.  He delivered my son in 98 by chance.  And in 2011 he delivered my daughter by choice. I was affraid of my first ultrasound due to 3 miscarriages (which he wasn't my dr at the time of miscarriages).  So at my first ultrasound to determine viability he came into the ultrasound with me.  I think this shows great character and empathy on his part.  Thanks Dr. Heywood!  you make Charleston WV a better place.  "
3048,39959,1.0,"He is not very bright to be so blunt,he doesn't listen its always wait and see, I've found another OB/GYN and right from the first visit she ran tests and I am now on meds I needed. "
3049,39959,1.0,Best Dr. that I have ever seen. The staff are very sweet and don't waste time talking or doing things not related to work. He is sweet and very professional but still caring.  
3050,39959,1.0,Dr. Heywood is the best Gyn doctor in the world!! I have seen him for several years and he always takes the time to answer any questions that i have in great detail. I have occasionally seen him NP and she also is very helpful and knowledgeable. Me and my husband are thinking about children in the near future and i would trust Dr.  Heywood and his NP with my care! 
3051,39959,1.0,"In 2002, I moved to the Charleston area during the first trimester of my first pregnancy.  Dr. Heywood was recommended to me by a local doctor.  Two babies later and I continue to be 100% satisfied with the care I've received from him over the past nine years.  I've recommended him, without hesitation, to several friends.  He's a keeper.  "
3052,39959,1.0,"I have been with Dr Heywood since about 05. I had a hysterectomy had a little complication but not to his fault, He was very caring / listened to my concernes.And to this date is still helping me with a complicated operation comming up. I feel safe with him just being in the OR.  "
3053,39959,1.0,"I love doctor Heywood, but his staff makes me want to get a new doctor. Their answering message says they are open from Monday-Thursday 8-4. So why is it that, right now on a Monday at 9 a.m., I'm getting that message rather than someone answering my call&#63; This happens all the time in the morning and after lunch. They &quot;forget&quot; to turn the phone back on.  I need to speak to my Dr or his nurse, and this is unacceptable! "
3054,39959,1.0,"Please take extreme caution if you choose this very incompetent physician.  As someone with medical knowledge and a copy of her medical reord, I feel that he allowed my grandmother to bleed to death after a simple hysterectomy procedure and acted like nothing happened.  My grandmother was in great health preoperatively as evidenced by testing procedures.  Secondly, I think that Dr. Heywood and CAMC went to great lengths to cover their mistakes. Repeated attempts, by an RN in the family who knew our grandmother was not doing well, failed to bring attention to her declining status.  She started having problems at 8 am in the morning and had passed away by 6 pm in the evening after being told she was going to be discharged at 4 pm.  When they told her she could leave, her fingertips were blue.  She is &quot;doing great&quot; we were told.  Please consider this physician very carefully or find someone who will at least listen to patient and family concerns.  "
3055,39959,1.0,"Dr. Heywood is wonderful. He's very calm, reassuring, and realistic. I have felt very comfortable with him throughout my pregnancy and have recommended him to many of my friends. He can seem quiet, but he is really very personable and funny.  "
3056,39959,1.0,He is not helpful what so ever. I'm pretty sure the only reason he is an OB/GYN is because of his daddy. 
3057,39959,1.0,"I love Dr.Heywood. He got me through a difficult pregnancy, to 26 weeks despite my PIH. He was very reassuring and careful. I recommend him to anyone! I hope to have another baby and trust Dr. Heywood 100%. I DID have some issues with his staff, but I don't blame him for that.  "
3058,39959,1.0,I was a patient of Dr. Heywood 1999-2004.  I was having problems with multiple miscarriages and he went above and beyond to help me.  I would recommend him to anyone. 
3059,39959,1.0,He never thinks anything is wrong all based on not running any test what so ever.Don't go to him if you want to find out what's wrong with you. 
3060,39959,1.0,He will not run test and doesn't think anything is every wrong with me. 
3061,39959,1.0,Dr. Heywood is the nicest Doctor I've ever been to...and is just such a nice person. 
3062,39959,1.0,. Simply the BEST! 
3063,39960,0.0,Wonderful caring doctor who loves all of her patients. Listens to all problems and is very knowledgeable 
3064,39961,1.0,Dr. Hanson is very intelligent and helpful. You need to call him for results on tests though. He cares about his patients but has a funny sense of humor that makes you reflect and could be misconstrued..  
3065,39961,1.0, 
3066,39962,2.0,.  
3067,39963,1.0,Very good doctor with a very good stff!  He found my colon cancer and probably helped to save my life.  
3068,39963,1.0,"Love, love, love Dr. Haffar.  I have been to several GI doctors and he is the best by far.  Very compansionate and a very good listener for starters.  Then he is knowledgable on top of that.  He was able to get my UC in remission after being flared up almost constantly for ten years.   His staff haven't been exactly rude with me, but they have a brisk manner sometimes.  The worst complaint I have about visiting him is that his waiting room is uncomfortable, especially if you have to wait very long. "
3069,39963,1.0,"I was talked to in a rude manner on the phone--I was actually &quot;hung up on&quot; and was told I would be on hold for a moment--trying to schedule a colonoscopy. I have known Dr.Haffar fr.the  beginning when he came to WV--I think highly of him,but have a problem with the staff--they wouldn't even allow me to get a word in edgewise on the phone. I will now have to schedule the test in Logan Co.,where everyone is so much nicer--Dr. Haffar goes to Logan once a mo. for scopes,thank goodness. even though I live in Charleston area,I now realize this is what I should have done to begin with--this way,I don't have to deal with the office staff in S. Charleston--they are totally rude and unhelpful.I am a nurse,and try to speak in a friendly manner and be helpful as possible.--treat others as you would like to be treated. "
3070,39963,1.0,. excellent physcian listens to your complaint recommend to every one 
3071,39963,1.0,"Dr. B. Haffar has taken care of me in the hospital and as an out-patient surgery.  He listens to his patients and evaluates each individually.  He and his office staff are very friendly and speak excellent English.  Thanks, Dr.  Haffar "
3072,39964,1.0,". Very good doctor, have been a patient of his for 3 years "

3076,39966,2.0,Pleasant and helpful.  
3077,39967,0.0,I have had 6 Charleston area physicians since I returned to WV in 2000 and she is By Far the best I have encountered. 
3078,39968,0.0,She was horrible! Dr.  Hurst had no idea what she was talking anoit- o went to another specialist and they told me she not only misdiagnosed me bit what she have me could have made my condition worse- or even kill me! I WILL never go back to her and I do NOT recommend dr melissa hurst-Cortellesi to ANYONE!!! 
3079,39969,1.0,"Dr. Hershfield is a cruise ship doctor for Norwegian Cruise Lines Pride of America.  He is professional, compassionate and an expert in his field. "
3080,39970,1.0,Dr. Hamirani is a very caring and knowledgable doctor.  He is highly respected by his peers and his patients love him.  I would highly recommend him to anyone needing a nephrologist.  He listens to you and gives you plenty of opportunity to ask questions.  He explains things in a way that a layman can understand.  
3081,39971,0.0,"I cannot praise Dr.Huls enough!! Very knowledgeable, shows genuine care for the patient and will go to all lengths to help with whatever the aliment may be.  The staff also are truly the best!!! "
3082,39971,0.0,"Can't say enough about Dr. Huls. She's very good at what she does, and you can tell she truly cares about making you feel better. I recommend her highly, and am very glad I was referred to her.  Great staff, too! "
3083,39972,1.0,"Dr. David Hess has been my family doctor for four years. What a wonderful doctor--he's smart, caring, and devotes attention to detail. He listens to his patients, and his genuine commitment to their well-being is obvious. His staff is fabulous--the nurse, the PA, and the office staff are a great group. Five stars simply doesn't do justice to Dr. David Hess and his team in Glendale, they're the best.  "
3084,39972,1.0,The very Best Doctor and his Staff is also the best.  
3085,39972,1.0,"Dr. Hess is an exceptional doctor, very caring and concerned for his patients welfare.  Spends time and doesn't downplay their problems. Specializes in family, internal and pediatrics. His wife is a pediatrician and they share an office.  You could not ask for a better, more knowledgeable physician to care for you.  "
3086,39973,2.0,Medical schools don't make doctors as good as this one. They have to be born with the instinct and compassion that comes with this doctor's understanding and consideration of people. I've been in the field as a therapist and I know what a &quot;real&quot; doctor is-- and Dr. John Hutton is a real-- doctor.  
3087,39974,0.0,. did every thing they needed to do very quick and hel[pfull 
3088,39974,0.0,"She has a wonderful staff, she is always smiling and does whatever she can iin her power to help..  "
3089,39974,0.0,"I had been to several doctors with complaints and was dismissed.  A friend recommended Dr. Hembree.  I told her my symptoms, and she knew exactly what was wrong with me!  Upon examination, her guess was confirmed.  Finally, someone listened to me.  "
3090,39975,1.0,"I went to see Dr. Howard back in March of 2009 because of severe TMJ pain. I'd been to a TMJ specialist and my family doctor. Neither could help me. Finally, to my husband's advice I went to see a chiropractor. He literally changed my life. I hadn't been able to eat solid foods for 3 months before seeing him, and I've had less overall pain ever since. I've been in a few car accidents, and I have a lot of anxiety which causes chronic widespread pain. Dr. Howard is gentle, maticulous and very caring. His staff is always friendly, and the massage therapists are also the best around.  I highly recommend him for chiropractic care! "
3091,39976,0.0,"I highly recommend Dr. Hassani. She listens and responds to patient needs like no other doctor I visited. I never feel rushed with her. Also, her office staff are responsive as well. They actually call the next day to check on their patients if necessary.  "
3092,39976,0.0,I'm glad I found her.  I have been looking for help for a illness I have and noone would listen.  She listens very well and she will be the only doctor I will see now.  Excellent Doctor and very personable.  
3093,39976,0.0,Dr. Hassani is the most compassionate Dr. I have ever had. She is very knowledgeable and takes the time to really listen. I highly recommend her. 
3094,39976,0.0,"incredible experience with this doctor. not only is she super friendly and knowledgable, but she takes her time to listen to patients and makes sure they leave her office reasured and comfortable with the visit...I would deffinetly recomend her to anyone! "
3095,39976,0.0,"This doctor is warm and compassionate, and takes time to listen to me. I feel she is very respectful and am very grateful to have her as my physician. "
3096,39977,2.0,Ohio Univ is excellent and Dr Homburg was very nice.  
3097,39978,1.0,awful. the only good quality about the office was his staff. everything else about him was just awful. 
3098,39978,1.0,Stated he could treat Fibromyalgia but was unable.  Only provided body alignment and oxygen therapy. 
3099,39979,1.0,Dr. Herring is a very nice polite doctor and he really makes you feel comfortable.  I would recommend him to anyone.  I have already recommended him to several people.  
3100,39980,1.0,No bedside manner. Not impressed with his skills either.  
3101,39981,1.0,"I would not ever recommend this doctor, not even to treat one of my dogs. He left my husband with severe brain damage after a failed attempt to put a pacemaker in. His judgement to proceed with the surgery after a technical failure in the operating room was a bad judgement. One that left my husband incapacitated and my family heartbroken. My husband died 10 months later from  respiratory failure after becoming septic from a urinary track infection that was caused from the catheter that my husband had to have because of the brain damage caused by this doctor. My only warning is BEWARE!!! "
3102,39981,1.0,The doc is great but his nurses are rude and not very knowledgeable.  They actually interfere with your care.  He needs to clean house.  
3103,39981,1.0,This doctor would not even come in my fathers room when repeadtly asked to from us and other personnel who would come in and tell us he was coming. My father is now having a surgery do to the pacemaker not working right He has one of the leads turned off and has to have it put directly into the heart. By a different physican. My dad has had trouble ever since the surgery and had to have the Medtronic people come in three times because of repeadtly being shocked by the pacemaker. Even Medtronic wasn't for sure how to turn one of it's own leads off by the person who came in my fathers room He had to call his company.  
3104,39981,1.0,This doctor should be avoided in my opinion.  He caused my husband to sustain a global brain injury during a routine surgery for a pacemaker.  Beware!!!! 
3105,39982,2.0,. very profesional and recovered well after my surgery 
3106,39982,2.0,. excellent doctor---recovered well 
3107,39983,1.0,When I went to Dr. Hargraves I was in very bad shape.  He took excellent care of me and I have never looked back.  This guy is truly one in a million.  Service and care is truly outstanding.  A true dedicated professional.  
3108,39983,1.0,"He is VERY good at his job. When he makes rounds at the hospital, he brings his office nurse with him, gives her the orders to give to staff nurses so there is question of something being missed. Very professional yet excellent bedside manner and making the patient feel like they are the only one he is caring for. When you are in his office, he listens to everything you need to discuss and explains everything in great detail.  The Best "
3109,39984,1.0,"Myself, my husband, and a close friend have all been patients. Dr. Herman diagnosed my foot condition within 3 minutes of being in his office, while another podiatrist in the area wanted to do a complicated surgery on my arch. Sure enough, the MRI showed that Dr. Herman was right. If I hadn't gotten a second opinion, I'd likely have had surgery for &quot;fallen arches&quot; instead of being treated for a bone fusion. Bad enough my previous doctor ordered 900$ orthotics that DON'T WORK! Dr. Herman's staff are very friendly and courteous. Don't let one person's bad experience fool you.  The three of us who wouldn't go anywhere else! "
3110,39984,1.0,"I went to this (Dr) for a heal spir, he gave me plastic inserts for my shoes I could not wear. I had to come back the next week because he had no X-Ray film! I came back! AND, HE TELLS ME ALL ABOUT THE PROBLEMS I'M GOING TO HAVE WITH MY BIG TOE!AND WANTS TO SCHEDULE SURGERY!!!!!!AND!!!!SHOWS ME PHOTOS OF WHAT HE IS GOING TO DO!!! That was in 09. Folks, my toe, still fine, new pair of shoes and a 1 visit to another Dr. fixed. Watch this guy, I know two other people who had issues! "
3111,39985,0.0,I have been seeing Dr. Hashmi for 15 years and she is the most caring doctor I have ever met. She has performed a hysterectomy on me 7 years ago and I left the hospital the next day.   She always makes me feel that I am her only patient she has that day. I love her and would never see anyone else.  
3112,39985,0.0,Great doctor.  Anyone who knows her loves her as a doctor and person. 
3113,39985,0.0,"I waited for months to get in to see Dr. Hashmi and had heard great things about her. I have never been so disappointed by a doctor in my life. If you are going to her for a normal yearly exam, you may be fine, but if you need anything more, be forewarned. She is a very &quot;paint by number&quot; doctor, who thinks there is one way to treat certain conditions and you better not disagree! She refuses to be asked questions and her staff says that you need to &quot;just trust her&quot; since she is the &quot;best&quot;. Give me a break! She was more concerned with &quot;looking the part&quot; of a doctor than treating her patient. She lied to me and also did not understand a simple medical procedure, which I had to explain to her! She was rude, condescending, accusatory, and has the worst bed side manner I've ever seen. I went to her once and refused to ever go back. It's been a year and I have a wonderful new doctor who listens to me and was open to discuss different options, something that Dr. Hashmi was &quot;too proud&quot; to do. "
3114,39986,1.0,"Dr Hill is wonderful!!! So is Peggy,great bedside manners, he came to see me on the labor and delivery floor on his day off when I was sent from his office, his own son was in surgery, his father had a heart attack and was flying out later that evening in the middle his sons surgery he came to check on me, now how's that for great bedside manners, thank you so much Dr Hill.  Lois &amp; Gigi "
3115,39986,1.0,"Very caring Doc!  We never felt rushed when we came in with a list of questions and never felt placated.  After a tragic pregnancy loss (with a different dr.), Dr. Hill was excellent at calming my fears and anxiety.  We have a beautiful baby girl!  Many thanks for Dr.  Hill! "
3116,39986,1.0,The best Dr ever. he is very concerned about his patients. made me feel very comfortable and performed a very fast c section.  
3117,39986,1.0,I found Dr. Hill in the phone book when I found out I was pregnant. I am now 27 weeks and have had a great experience. Great office staff and very helpful.  
3118,39986,1.0,"He returned the on call/page quickly in the middle of the night but he never asked if I had Placenta Previa on the call.  I saw him in the ER when I started bleading at 34 wks.  All he said is &quot;don't get up you're going to bleed out and die.&quot;  Then he got my blood type wrong in the assessment, which the next doctor on shift caught.  "
3119,39986,1.0,"he repeatedly treated me for an infection that never existed, then performed a laparoscopy because (to my horror) he suspected that I had an STD.  all the while, my chief compliant was vulvar pain.  he never diagnosed the condition, which turned out to be vulvar vestibulitis (diagnosed by another doc)- not an infection - not an STD. &#63;&#63;&#63; "
3120,39986,1.0,Dr. Hill is very caring and helpful in understanding what is really going on. This was our first child so there was a great deal of a learning experience we encountered. He always took an extra minute if we needed it to explain.  If we ever have another baby we will go to him without a doubt! 
3121,39986,1.0,"Excellent MD. Intelligent, accurate and wonderful bedside manner. Office is new, clean. Pleasant staff. Exceptionally well tuned to putting expectant mothers at ease and properly monitoring and delivering children.  "
3122,39987,2.0, 
3123,39988,1.0,"He is a Great doctor, very smart and down too earth hope everyone goes to him "
3124,39988,1.0,"He is very knowledgeable and a great diagnostician. He also has a sense of humor, which alleves the natural stress of a doctor's visit.  "
3125,39989,1.0,HE IS WONDERFUL I WILL ONLY TAKE MY SON THERE HE HAS DONE SO MUCH FOR MY SON. HE HAS FIXED ANOTHER DOCTORS MISTAKE AND IT TURNED OUT WONDERFUL. WONDERFUL STAFF COULDNT SAY ENOUGH ABOUT HIM AND THEM BESIDES THEY WHERE SENT FROM THE HEAVENS ABOVE. CLEAN NEAT NICE WONDERFUL. JUST A GREAT KNOWLEDGEABLE TEAM CLINICALS R GREAT.

PROMPT WHEN ITS TIME TO GET OUT OF THE HOSPITAL IF YOU GO IN THE HOSPITAL AFTER PROCEDURE. WONERFUL WONDERFUL WONDERFUL. VERY HELPFULL AND VERY EASY TO GET ALONG WITH. 
3126,39991,1.0,The worst experiense ever!! Stay away!! I had to wait an hour to see a doctor who instead of being honest tried to make me see him instead of the Dr. Roshan. They managed to make me so upset (and I'm pregnant) that I had to see a doctor after this experience 
3127,39991,1.0,"This doctor is great!, very patient-oriented, patients are NOT just a 15-minute space on his computer. Staff are great, phone calls are answered immediately. This doctor will see you one day, if your condition was fairly serious he will call the next day to see how you are doing...how many doctors do this&#63; He follows up with you until your condition is resolved and the correct treatment is obtained. He is good at explaining your questions, discussing the pros and cons, giving reassurance if you are in question regarding your treatment, and will work with you until the problem is resolved.This doctor is one in a million and being a medical transcriptionist I believe I would know the difference.  This doctor will stick by you regardless of your circumstances, is concerned regarding your problems, will help you in any way he possibly can because he is interested in his patients. I have only known one other doctor in this category and he did not even come up to comparison with Dr. Hussain.  "
3128,39992,1.0,"What a great doctor, physician, person... He's the GREATEST DOCTOR EVER!!!!!! "
3129,39993,0.0,I feel very taken care of by Dr. Harvey.  I an very happy I becane her patient!!! 
3130,39993,0.0,GREAT DR.  AND GREAT STAFF  IF I HAVE TO CALL ABOUT A PROBLEM THEY ALWAYS GET BACK TO ME THAT DAY 
3131,39993,0.0,"Dr. Harvey is an amazing doctor. Herself along with her staff's friendly service..........well, I've recommended her to many.  Very knowledgeable and caring doctor "
3132,39995,1.0,.  
3133,39995,1.0,He was to excise a fistula scar from my wife's neck and he made the excision horizontally for a vertical scar. He is very very inept in his work. 
3134,39996,0.0,Dr. Elisa is a very caring and super nicedoctor.  I have been with her for 6 years and she delivered my first baby girl.  She treated me excellent! 
3135,39996,0.0,"I think Dr. Irisari and her husband, an on/gyn as well, are wonderful doctors. The busy-ness in their office shows how popular they are as doctors. They have been recommended to me many times and I have heard great things about them before I went to them. I think this husband and wife team are great and I heard they have a daughter who is now and ob/gyn. I would recommend them to anyone.  "
3136,39996,0.0,"This is mostly a rating of the overall office. There are too many patients and there is always a wait. The office is so unorganized (understatement), it took them a month to get my lab results! They can't even write a prescription correctly without a hassle. The nurses are not personable and act as if they don't care what happens to you or not.  The atmosphere is unpleasant and the workers to my account should not be in the healthcare field with the attitudes they have!!! "
3137,39997,1.0,He is awesome... Has done several surgeries on my grandma and she had very little to no down time..  he is prompt and makes sure things get done fast...  He can't stand to see someone suffer! 
3138,39997,1.0,"This man is top notch! I've heard about poor bedside manner and have to disagree. He's not a stand up comedian, he is assessing every aspect of you neurologically as he visits with you.  That is his job.  He is very caring &amp; meticulous. I believe that he would not put one of his patients through anything that he wouldn't be willing to go through himself. I would trust this doctor with my life at any given time. He's amazing!! I've never witnessed a long wait as described above and his staff is very helpful and courteous. He does not display arrogance concerning his abilities and he listens to the patient.  It is from other sources that one will hear of his very impressive track record. Kudos to Dr. Iggy, I cannot thank you enough for what you've done for my husband. "
3139,39997,1.0,this man saved my life. he is truley a asset to the tri state. L.  Billups 
3140,39997,1.0,"He schedules 4 people every 15 minutes, makes you wait in the waiting room about 2 hours and then spends about 5 minutes with you.  He missed a bone spur, compressing a nerve on me "
3141,39998,1.0,. Ive been seeing him for years and has been a very good Doctor! 
3142,39999,1.0,". Most knowledgeable family physician that I have ever met or had as a doctor!  I wish all doctors had his &quot;bedside manner&quot; and &quot;listening&quot; skills!  I cannot say enough good about this fantastic docti!  However, THANKS is a very important word concerning my appreciation for him! "
3143,39999,1.0,"Fantastic. Always takes his time explores all options and offers the best advice. Nice guy, you will feel comfortable. I feel blessed to have him. "
3144,39999,1.0,"Veru helpful and , limited staffing and longer wait time. "

3146,40013,2.0, Great dentist who emphasizes on doing quality work in a timely fashion. 
3147,40013,2.0,.  Love this Dentist and Staff!!! Always on time and always nice! 
3148,40015,1.0, I cannot recommend Dr. Kella too highly; he is a wonderful physician/surgeon. He took time for me and did not hurry his pre and post surgical exams to assure that he was giving me his best care. He made an unpleasant situation comfortable for me and my wife. 
3149,40015,1.0, One of the best and caring doctors we have known. My brother was in the hospital for 5 months. We never thought he would make it out of the hospital but thanks to Dr. Kella and his determination he is doing great.  What a wonderful Dr.     The Swiger Family 
3150,40015,1.0," I felt that Dr. Kella was a great surgeon. I had my surgery on 2/23/13 to have laproscopic done on my stomach. He is a great person also and treated me with the most profession that a doctor has. I would recommend Dr. Kella to anyone that needed his service. I thank you to the upmost for being there for me, I don't know what I would have done without him. Again, thank you and May God Bless!             Jennie Miller "

3152,40015,1.0," I met Dr. Kella after being admitted to the ER with a ruptured appendix. His friendly professional manner put me at ease immediately and he managed my care for over two months without any complications, culminating in a minimally invasive laparoscopic surgery to remove the appendix on 1/3/13. His office staff were knowledgeable and friendly, and called before every appointment and after every test to answer any questions we had. I feel very fortunate that Dr. Kella was my surgeon and highly recommend him and Weirton Medical Center. "
3153,40015,1.0," Dr. Kella saved my mother's life. He made sure my family understood the surgery procedures.  He is one of the most caring and compassionate doctors I have ever encountered.  After the surgery, he checked on my mother 2-3 times a day.  My whole family loves him!!! "
3154,40015,1.0," I am rating for my parents as they do not care to have access to the Internet.  Dr. Kella, a surgeon at Weirton Medical Center, was compassionate towards the family and was willing to spend time explaining the procedure.  He even hand-drew a diagram of the internal organs to explain what was going to happen in the surgery.  Dr. Kella also conducted follow-up calls to my parents to see how they were doing.  My parents thinks well of Dr. Kella and highly recommend him. "
3155,40015,1.0," I had my thyroid removed on October 4, 2012.  Dr. Kella did an excellent job.  His bedside manner is amazing.  I would definitely recommend him to others needing care. "

3158,40018,2.0, Entire staff especially Dr. Kafka were wonderful.  Would highly recommend this physician. Dr. Kafka relayed information in a way that was very understandable for my 80 yr. old mother. 
3159,40018,2.0,".  A super, friendly and kind staff knowledgeable and professional and the doctor was informative, courteous and overall I rank them amazing "
3160,40023,1.0, Dr. Kelly is knowledgable and is good in an emergency.  He cares about his patients. He explains his treatment strategy and elicits patient input.  
3161,40023,1.0,.  dr kelly is a very good doctor he takes time to listen to his patents 
3162,40023,1.0, Dr. Kelly has treated our family from toddlers to age 60. He cares about his patients.  
3163,40029,0.0, Great doctor. Spent a great deal of time with me. It was an independent medical exam by the insurance company but she was very fair. 
3164,40029,0.0," Dr. Kazi has demonstrated a great deal of interest for my well-being.  Her attention to details and knowledge, particularly how she communicated, were one of the best I have ever seen. I would strongly recommend Dr. Kazi to others and without any hesitation.  I wish there were many doctors like her.  Thanks doc. "
3165,40029,0.0," Dr. Kazi, great political activist, poor physician.  Dr. Kazi seems only interested in getting government money, as a Second Opinion Evaluator for DOL, and does not take medical responsibility for her medical opinions regarding patients she evaluates (without supportive testing). She has intentionally decieved the government contractors ACS, the Department of Labor, and patients, by providing misleading information regarding her practice as a physician, and her office location.  She cannot provide business cards ,or any other document, which indicates location of her practice.   I as a patient find this disconcerting, especially since her evaluation as a physician in her particular specialty, determines my life and future, via diagnosis, prognosis and treatment.   Beware of specialized physicians who have no history, reputation, or office location. "
3166,40035,2.0,  
3167,40036,2.0," Some of staff very nice and helpful, but not all - it took many, many calls for the main girl to get back to me.  "
3168,40046,1.0," Dr. Keesee is a young man early into his practice. He is very thorough and has gained much confidence in the last year. He is caring, helpful and interested in each patient. I have confidence in him.  "
3169,40051,1.0," Not a very good Doctor, He lies to his patients, his bedside manner is terrible. "
3170,40051,1.0, Absolutely the best!!! 
3171,40059,1.0," I saw Dr. Karnsakul in WV. Dr. Karnsakul was a very rude dr. He made me feel stupid and acted as if all my medical problems were made up. He basically told me he couldn't help me. Also, I had a very hard time getting an appointment. I also had to wait forever in the waiting room and in the patient room. "
3172,40059,1.0," Dr Karnsakul is a great doctor, friendly, respectful and extremely knowledgeable. He explained all tests carefully and has helped my son regain his health.He is by far the best doctor I have ever worked with and will miss him when he moves to John Hopkins. "
3173,40059,1.0," dr. karnsakul went completely out of his way to help my son. he is without a doubt the best dr i have ever had to deal with.  he not only made calls on his own to check up on my son and his condition, but he also gave me his cell and home numbers just in case i needed them. also, he personally called me himself to let me know that he was leaving wvu and going to baltimore, and then he recommended another good dr for my son to see. "
3174,40059,1.0, Dr. Karnsakul does not care about his patients and does not want to help them. He was very rude and does not try to explain things to you. Trying to get an appointment is almost impossible too. 
3175,40060,2.0, Very unprofessional staff. They canceled on me and would not set anything up for another 2 months out. They do not personally care about your business. 
3176,40062,2.0,.   
3177,40065,1.0," This doctor will give you what ever drug you want, uppers, downers what ever you need! So if you are a drug addict no need to go to a dealer this doctor will keep you high with no problem!!! "
3178,40065,1.0, Great Doctor.  Never have to wait long for scheduled appt.  Very Personable.  
3179,40065,1.0, Very kind and compassionate man. Takes his time to thoroughly explain things and prescriptions. Only shortcoming is the later in the day your appt is the longer you will wait. 
3180,40065,1.0, Dr. Kellogg rocks. This man actually looks at you when you're talking which is phenomenal in a dr these days. He has made every effort to work with my schedule and address my concerns. He is a genuinely endearing man who makes it easy for you to discuss anything with and seems to have some curiosity about his patients individual lives. I appreciate that in a person however I find it extraordinary in a doctor. Highly recommend Dr. Kellogg.  
3181,40065,1.0," Dr. Kellogg makes a concerted effort to get to know his patients and keeps detailed records of their history(while under his care, I have never felt as if I was just a number). He always takes time to answer any questions that I may have and is thorough in his diagnosis. I highly recommend him as a primary physician. "
3182,40065,1.0," Very careing,Listens and trusts his patients.  He came to a hospital he didn't work at to make sure i recieved the right meds. and treatment. "
3183,40071,0.0," I had extensive surgery by Doctor Katrib 10 years ago, therefore when my daughter had to have sinus surgery there is not a ear, nose throat doctor that I would ever send her to besides Dr. Katrib.  Dr. Katrib has a wonderful bed side manner, he did wonders for me and my daughter.  He explains the surgery well and kept me informed during my daughters operation.  I had nasal surgery by another ear, nose and throat doctor a couple of years before Dr. Katrib did my surgery and he had to fix a problem which should have already been corrected by my first surgery.  As I said it has been 10 years since my surgery, but I have had no problems at all.  My daughter is also very pleased with her surgery. She had suffered with migraines for at least a year and was being treated with no success when I took her to Dr. Katrib and he quickly found out that the problem was sinus issues.  To me Dr. Katrib should not get any other than top ratings.   Excellent doctor!  Robin O'Neal "
3184,40071,0.0," This dr. can be nice at times, but he can be very nasty and rude.  I was not happy with the results of my surgery at all.  "
3185,40075,0.0," Very thorough. She doesn't overbook (not greedy) so she can see patients for adequate amount of time without other patients having to wait very long.  Never spent less than 15 minutes with her.  She follows guidelines (I'm in healthcare too so I know the guidelines).  Knowledgable but will not hesitate to refer you do a specialist if something is out of her scope.  Office staff is great, my only complaint would be that they have very little knowledge on medicaitons and they SOMETIMES take too long calling in my prescriptions.  She does not inappropriately prescribe antibiotics to patients with a viral infection (a point I love but you may not) and she does not take chronic pain patients as new patients (though she adequately treats pain in current patients with legitimate need).  Reasonable cost compared with other primary care physicians.  "
3186,40076,2.0,  
3187,40078,1.0, very good. takes time with his patients & family so they understand everything.  
3188,40078,1.0, very honest and helpful. Loves each and every one of his patients. the best!!! 
3189,40080,1.0, He is very personable and is extremely kind with my elderly mother.  He seems to be ahead of the curve on new procedures and medicines.  My mother has received excellent care with him.  Only downfall is there is generally a longer than necessary wait for our scheduled appointment time.  I would NOT change to another Dr - he is excellent. 
3190,40080,1.0," Dr. Kahwash is the best endocrinologist I have found in Charleston.  He listens well and asks great questions.  He remembers who I am and what's going on from one visit to the next. He's knowledgeable, observant, and he keeps up with research in his field.  As a result of his treatment, my thyroid issues are finally stable.  (Finally! Five years and four other doctors after I131.) He's also quite the decent human, which (I've found) is a rare quality among doctors in this town. "
3191,40080,1.0, He does not care about what the patient has to say. He wants thing his way. Does not prescrible the right test. 
3192,40084,0.0,.   
3193,40084,0.0," She was over an hour late for my first visit. Then I sat in an uncomfortable exam room for 20 minutes more. Her staff seem to be either very over-worked or incompetent. She suggested treatments that I would need to find another specialist for, and I was expected to figure out who and where these doctors were myself. With zero guidance, she calls herself an expert but doesn't give any answers or treatments. Poor, but well meaning.  "
3194,40084,0.0," What&#63;! Did I see the same doctor rated below&#63; She was cold and unfriendly and made me feel quite uncomfortable. After advising me that the test she was doing would hurt, she acted irritated when I became anxious about it. Zero compassion or understanding. Didn't give me a chance to speak. Finally I said I was too scared to proceed. She told me I could leave. I did. "
3195,40084,0.0," Great doctor. She's very busy in Canada. Staff was knowledgeable, and she shows true interest and will take care of her patients. "
3196,40084,0.0," Canadian Health Care! We don't pay a cent! Dr Kasmi was recruited to Southlake Hospital, Newmarket, Ontario Canada in 2010. The staff she hired here are totally useless. "
3197,40084,0.0," Dr. Kazmi was good, personable, listened and seemed knowledgeable.  Her staff on the other hand did not know what they were doing at all.  The woman that took my blood pressure acted like she had never taken blood pressure before.  They were very un-professional. At this level of medical care, the staff shouyld be very knowladgeable and professional.  The waiting area was so heavily prefumed with one of those odor eliminators, I could hardly breathe.  There's alot of people that cannot tolerate scents, me being one of them.  I will not return mainly because of the sub standard staffing. "
3198,40084,0.0," She is a very a very nice Dr. Takes very good care of her patients. Her office personel however will forget to make your appt,forget to call in your prescriptions. she needs to train her employees, but she is a wonderful Dr. "
3199,40086,2.0, Very good docter 
3200,40087,1.0, This Dr. kalou is a quake all the way.. he will get you hooked on narcotics and just cut you off whenever he chooses! He doesn't car at all about his patients..they only have 4 chairs in his office and embody else waiting has to stand like a horse...you will wait 2 hrs every time you have to see him. And the staff is extremely rude...  
3201,40087,1.0, I would not recommend this doctor to anyone.He does not listen to what you have to say. He does not care abouy hid patients. He is never on time he is a quack. 
3202,40087,1.0," My experience with this doctor has thus far been HORRIBLE. I have been diagnosed with degenerative disc disorder fracture in L5 and wanted to receive REAL medical help concerning my severe back pain. All he was interested in doing was handing me Lortab after 1min meeting with me. After a couple times of him doing this I got so mad I ripped the prescription up ... he threw me out the office. No referrals, still in pain ...  DO NOT GO HERE! He is only interested in your money and getting you high! "
3203,40087,1.0," I have fibromyalgia, a vascular necrosis in my right wrist, spinal degeneration, scoliosis, anxiety, depression, underactive thyroid, high cbirkenstock chronic back pain and top that off with ADD.  When I first walked into Dr. Kalou's office I was barely functioning.  He cared enough to listen and he completely changed my quality of life. He gave me my life back.  "
3204,40087,1.0, His staff is horrible about refills. He DOES not hand out narcotics as these other patients reviled. Every time I have had issues he has always made me go through a series of test. I think maybe the patients aren't giving him enough information to diagnose with.  
3205,40087,1.0," Staff is ok at best.  phone calls are seldom returned, referrals not always made, test results, lab work etc you have to hound the office to obtained the results and follow up "
3206,40087,1.0," Words can not describe my level of disapointment with this &quot;physician&quot;.  Even the staff seems dirty and rude.  In all honesty, not exagerating, I feel I could revieve better health care in my child's 9th grade health class.  It disturbs me that this physician is allowed to practice. "
3207,40087,1.0," As a previous patient of this doctor, I can confirm the  complaints.  He could care less about his patients.  If you want a doctor to hand you some pain pills and send you out the door, he is your man.  Greedy, pompous, and arrogant to say the least. .  He spent a total of 2 minutes with me during both appointments.  I can't believe this physician is allowed to practice.  He is the definition of what is  wrong with the USA health care system. "
3208,40087,1.0, he sucks as a doctor and just gives out heavy meds .dont care about my real problem .if you are looking for a doctor to give you loratab he is your man . wont a doctor that cares go somewhere else or you will end up like a dope head 
3209,40087,1.0," Dr. Kalou advertised himelf as &quot;Sam&quot; so you think you are getting an English speaking American.  He is actually Osama, Syrian and poor English speaker. Furthermore his medical skills are those of a first year student.  "
3210,40090,1.0, He acts nice as long as you got money but if the money runs out and you have no insurance he seems not to care about fixing a broken tooth and everything. 
3211,40102,1.0, Dr. Lazer was wonderful and so was his staff.  I had eyelid surgery.   Everything went well witoiut a hitch & results were better than I expected! 
3212,40104,2.0," good, helpful, takes time with me.  very knowledgable "
3213,40112,0.0," Dr. Larzo is just wonderful, she works well with my daughter and has always been helpful.  Further, she really listens when I have concerns and is open to discussing things with me.  "
3214,40128,1.0, Dr Labus was recommended by a co-worker several years ago and we have been very pleased with him. He is conscientious and kind. 
3215,40128,1.0, Dr. Labus went to church with my family and I years ago. I am 25 now and he has always been a great doctor. He listens to you and is EXTREMELY knowledgable. I'd recommend him over any doctor in WV. He is also very honest and will take time for his patients.  
3216,40130,1.0, Great bedside manor. Knowledgeable and patient. I really liked his approach.  
3217,40131,1.0," Dr. Lao is a wonderful doctor with a great beside manor, however I do not care for his staff. The staff has lost results, they are rude/ non-professional, never call you about test results, take forever to schedule your appointment, and just not a good fit for such a good doctor.  "
3218,40131,1.0," Words can never express how grateful I am to Dr. Lao and his staff.  They saved mine and my baby's life... Literally.  Sometimes he can seem to be overprotective or a &quot;worry-wart&quot; but this is for your best interest.  Not only did Dr. Lao's medical giftedness save our lives, but most importantly - his passion for making a difference in the lives of mothers and babies.   I would definitely recommend him! A++ "
3219,40131,1.0," Dr. Lao accepted me as an OB patient when I was 3 months pregnant, because my original doctor was horrible and uncaring. Dr. Lao is WONDERFUL! With every symptom/problem I had, he would always listen and answer every question I had, even though I asked a 1000 questions during my first pregnancy. He checked on me several times during labor and was right there when my daughter was ready to arrive! I recommend Dr. Lao to everyone! "
3220,40131,1.0," Although Dr. Lao listens to questions, if he doesn't want to answer them, he won't.  I was Dr. Lao's patient for less than 5 months and have switched to a new doctor.  I HIGHLY suggest that you continue looking for another physician. "
3221,40131,1.0," DR LAO DID MY HYSTERECTOMY AND I FULLY TRUST HIM. HE IS PATIENT AND LISTENS TO WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY. HE IS NOT YOUR TYPICAL MALE OB/GYN,MEANING, HE LISTENS AND ACTUALLY CARES ABOUT BLEEDING PROBLEMS AND QUALITY OF FEMALE MATTERS. "
3222,40135,1.0, Doctor Lagos is an excellent doctor. he knows exactly what he is doing. He did an amazing job. It was a very positive experience. 
3223,40135,1.0," Dr. lagos is a very knowledgeable doctor, who seems to really care about his patients.  I have seen him as well as his two P.A.'s.  I have been a patient for 5 years and am overall really pleased.  I would recommend Dr. Lagos to anyone in need of a dermatologist.  "
3224,40135,1.0, He had a patient complaining about there bill and the staff didn't care and thought it was funny everyone in the waiting room could hear them talking about that person it was not professional and even though my insurance paid most of my bill it cost about 2000.00 to have 4 moles removed and he would not use the lab my insurance requested and I had to pay all of the lab fee out of my own pocket. I had a long wait in the waiting room and he spent very little time with me . I will not go back 
3225,40142,1.0, he and his staff are great. they helped my daughter in one visit. always have helped myself with most all of my medical needs love them all 
3226,40142,1.0," The best doctor ever. I have many health problems. Other doctors gave up on me, but Dr. Lakhani has made me healthier and made my life worth living. The staff is great also.  "
3227,40142,1.0, He is the best physician in this state hands down.  
3228,40144,1.0," I'm surprised to see Dr. Lancaster under &quot;General&quot; instead of &quot;Pediatric&quot; so I am hoping that I have the right doctor. If I have the right Dr. Lancaster, I can say that he is wonderful. He took excellent care of my son when he was in the hospital.  Very, very caring doctor! "
3229,40151,1.0, He is a great doctor you couldnt ask for anyone any better.  
3230,40154,1.0," He was rude and vey unhelpful thoughout my term and he didn't even deliever my baby....i would not go to him ever again..rude,to me and,my family the whole time.....  "
3231,40160,0.0," Jennifer is very personable and makes every visit as comfortable as possible.  She is very concerned about the patient's entire well-being.  She is very funny and one doesn't leave the office without a few good chuckles.  Her staff is very nice, always following up with patients and the wait time is short.   I highly recommend! "
3232,40174,2.0,  
3233,40178,2.0,.  Great doctor has common since and good bedside manner 
3234,40183,1.0," I hope he outlives me. If I ever have surgery again, Dr. Lee is the man.  Excellent surgeon and kind as well! "
3235,40183,1.0, Thank You Dr. Lee! 
3236,40185,2.0,  
3237,40187,1.0," Dr. Lasker and his nurse were wonderful in my care. I was a very complex patient and his compassion with my treatment was the best. I returned to see him for my annual exams even after moving out of state. While in the hospital the nurses commented to me several times that he would call to check on me after his office hours. When I moved further away and could not return to see him, I saw several GYN's until I found one that was almost as compassionate about patient care that he was.  "
3238,40187,1.0, I was a high risk patient with a severe case of endometriosis and Dr Lasker couldn't have done anymore that was humanly possible to treat me.  Unless there was an emergency he is always on time and explains whatever the situation is until you understand the patients health and his bed side manner is at the most highest standard.  
3239,40189,2.0,"I left Dr Murray as a patient after many years because some of the office staff is so rude, phone calls were never returned, and several health problems that were never taken care of or even looked into.  "
3240,40190,1.0,"very rude and uncaring, will never see him again "
3241,40191,0.0,"Worst doc I have ever been to, and that's saying something.  Tried to switch - she wouldn't allow it.  Got my medication wrong in my chart; no bedside manner; generally made me feel like less of a human.  Any other doc in the practice is great - they just need to get rid of her. "
3242,40192,1.0,.  
3243,40192,1.0,anyone planing to see this Dr. PLEASE check the web site West Virgina Board of Medicine. He was in Lewisburg on maplewood ave. sexual misconduct. 2 counts and 1 count of improper performance of surgery 
3244,40193,1.0,I really enjoy the visit with Dr.  Morris he listens to your concerns and is very caring with my children he is very pleasant to everyone that comes in to see him

3247,40196,1.0,This doctor literally gave me back my life.......I was semi paralysed on my left side due to spinal stenosis and the operation he did almost completely alleviated that 
3248,40197,1.0,He is a great Dr very detailed about the problem and what needs to be done.  Whenever my child is sick the staff gets my child in within the next day if not that same day.  The staff is very nice and helpful!  If I call in with questions the nurse takes the time to explain the answer.   Very glad to have hime as my childs Dr! 
3249,40197,1.0,"My 7 month old son had a rash and he accused my wife of being a drug addict because we hadn't brought the kid in yet. He prescribed some sort of cream that has been known to cause retardation in the development of children. I researched the cream when I got home and we decided that we were not going to use it. So I took my son to another doctor who said,&quot; He has dermatitis and you should rub Lubriderm on him.&quot; That is what we were already doing. My son broke a tooth the next day, after seeing the second doctor, and his rash went away. Still yet according to Russell Miller, we were bad parents with alcohol or drug problems and he wanted us to rub a drug that was still being tested and had already been known to cause development problems in children. Needless to say we never went to him again and our new doctor has done a very good job. My son is now almost 4 and healthy as can be. NO thanks to Russell Miller.  "
3250,40198,1.0,"Most knowlegabe Physician you will ever incounter! Always, consitantly seeking answers to your medical issues.   Has the best bedside manner. He shows genuine concern for you. He generally runs late with your appts, because he takes time with every patient. Every patient gets his undivided attention.   If you are a patient of his you will not be rushed out the door nor will you be talked down to. It is so easy to talk to him, he is so gentle.  He is like talking to your best friend, that's becasue he is one. I trust his judgement.  He always allows the patient to be a part of the recovery process. He knows when to send you out to a specialist and when not to.  He has no problem referring you when it is necessary. His front office staff is excellant! Not to mention his Nurses- Amy and Crystal you cannot beat them! The Doctor, Nurses and Staff all work togther like a team with the same goal. Seeing that the patient gets the best possible medical care possible.  "
3251,40198,1.0,"My family has seen Dr McCann for several years.  He is very caring, takes time to talk to you, and listen to you.  He tries to help before sending you to a specialist or for testing.  Sometimes the wait can be long, but that is because he spends time listening to all his patients.  You don't feel rushed, like you didn't have time to mention something you wanted to talk about.  I recommend Dr McCann to anyone who wants a helpful, caring doctor.  "
3252,40198,1.0,"Dr. McCann is very personable, higly inteligent and  he always takes the time to listen to any medical complaints that I may have. He is very consientious he will double check through your medical history and any of the latest lab and test results before he makes a medical decision.  If options are available he will inform you of them.  He allows you to be apart of the process of getting better.   He discusses everything very clearly and in a language that you can understand.  He asks if you have any other questions.  My whole family sees him.  He usually runs late for appointments, but he will make it very  much worth your wait. I very much trust his advice.   No complaints here.  "
3253,40199,1.0,"Dr. Mani was my urologist when I needed emergency surgery and went through the ER.  I rarely find that the docs I meet through the ER are this wonderful, but he really knew what he was talking about and did an excellent job.   Terrific bedside manner!  Glad to have found him! "
3254,40199,1.0,He is very up front and honest. Great doctor. Good for cancer.  
3255,40199,1.0,"Dr. Mani is thorough, knowledgeable, and has spends as much time as it takes to research the patient's history, make a diagnosis, and follow up. "

My mother could be a difficult patient at times, but he and his staff always treated her with dignity and respect.

3276,40211,1.0,"I arrived at the ER in New Martinsville, WV. The staff was nice. The problem started with the doctor as he looked at my records. I requested an x-ray. Dr Monseau started my visit by accusing me of being an addict. He refused to do the x-ray. He went on to say that my family doctor, Dr Morris is not much of a doctor, in his opinion. He did not look at my back. He just ran his mouth until I got mad.  "
3277,40212,1.0,"NO supervision in impoverished Wheeling in Appalachia West Virginia..is NOT an employee of either troubled Wheeling Hospital or horrifyingly troubled OVMC;  as a &quot;Morgantown Appalachia educated&quot; family doctor, does not seem to be competent in dealing with the complexities of depression, academic failure at ELITE universities, abusive alcoholism or the &quot;geriatrics&quot; of elderly/nearly blind drivers resultant in lawsuits.... "
3278,40212,1.0,"Found this Morgantown educated family doctor less than competent or ethical in complex medical situations...Mercer is unsupervised and undisciplined in Wheeling: he rents a room at the Wheeling Clinic building but is not an employee of either (both are educationally and financially troubled with Ohio Valley eliminating staff) Wheeling or Ohio Valley hospitals.  Mercer has no supervision in impoverished Wheeling, as the availability of quality health care continues to decline in tandem with the precipitous and continuing decline in Wheeling area population and economic viability. "
3279,40212,1.0,"I am VERY disappointed with the care a relative of mine received (or did not I guess) from Dr. Mercer. I could go on & on, but let's just say he's not the doctor he used to be, and that's a shame. "
3280,40212,1.0,"This doctor's office is one of the most comfortable environments I've experienced in the health care field.  You're treated as family, and never talked at, the treatment is discussed with you, and I've always been able to call and talk to someone in regards to any concern I have.  I've been with this office for 20 years and will continue to be a patient of Dr. Mercer. "

3283,40212,1.0,"I have been going to Dr Mercer since he began private practice 20 years ago. I never have to wait for an appt, get a live person when I call on the phone, love the office staff, and think Dr Mercer is very knowledgable and conscientous. My grandparents, mother, father and daughter are all patients of his, and we're all pleased with the care we get from both him and his nurse practitioner. I'm glad he's young so he'll be there for me for many more years! I'd recommend him highly.  "
3284,40212,1.0,Dr. Mercer is one of the finest doctors in Wheeling. As far as his knowledge...he is more up to date than any doctor i know!! He is compassionate and smart. I think the other rating is ridiculous and very inaccurate 
3285,40212,1.0,"He was quite non aggressive in his care of my family, including myself. Resulting in the 2 year growing ailment of my daughter that is now being attended by a pediatrician who immediately diagnosed her and is giving her the best care possible....now. "
3286,40213,1.0,"Dr. Midcap is one of the BEST Doctors I have ever seen. He is patient, kind, compassionate and very caring! He always takes his time with you and finds out what your problem is and treats it! The wait to see him is sometimes very long, but it does not bother me at all. I know that when my turn comes, he will give me as much time as all his other patients, no matter how late it is. There are so many people who feel the same as I do, and that's why the wait is so long to see him. You won't find another Doctor more dedicated to his patients than Dr. Midcap.  "
3287,40213,1.0,"Dr. Midcap is very knowledgeable, but at times I'm not sure he understands what I'm trying to convey to him. I explained to him my constant headaches, body aches and general fatigue, and he offered Fioricet for migraines and suggested a sleep study for the fatigue. I tend to think this diagnosis is incorrect, but I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt. He recently helped me switch depression medication, and knew a lot about the characteristics of what I was taking and what I wanted to take; and he provided samples to make sure that this medication was what I needed before I paid for it. His staff is always helpful and courteous, and service is usually prompt.  "

3297,40218,1.0,"He saw me within 45 minutes when I called about having shingles. He and his staff stayed after hours to help me, I was in misery. No other doctor I know cares so much about his patients, and he IS the best dermatologist in the state.  "
3298,40218,1.0,"I saw this dermatologist twenty years ago. He diagnosed four separate skin problems and it all turned out to be something else! He wrote four separate prescriptions, none of which helped my problem. Dr. Parsons is by far Charleston's best dermatologist! "
3299,40218,1.0,"Dr. Milroy is THE best at dermatology in this state. He is the nicest, kindest, most knowledgable doctor I have met in my 63 years. It is true he is hard to get an appointment with, due to his skills and reputation. It is true your visit make take longer than you expect, because he doesn't hurry with anyone and seriously sick people such as cancer patients are given priority. That is the way I want my doctor to be. It is kind of a catch 22 for a good doctor. People complain if they are rushed in and out during their visit and they also complain if the doctor takes too long to get to them. I personally do not mind waiting and getting a very thorough exam. I noticed in several of the previous ratings that they remarked he wasn't clear about explaining things. Nothing could be further from the truth. He explains everything in detail. You have to take time to listen.  "
3300,40218,1.0,Nice guy but didn't take a medical history & that worries me. Also takes forever to get an appointment. 
3301,40219,1.0,"I just got back from my first dental work experience with Dr. Mosley, and I couldn't be more pleased. I don't know how much it will cost yet (it was just a filling, but it was a big tricky one), but for me it will be worth every penny because he is the first dentist I've had in a long time that I feel I can absolutely trust to take the best care of my teeth. I have a number of dental issues ranging from an open bite to congenital malformed dentin and weak enamel, which many previous dentists have not taken into account when developing treatment plans. Dr. Mosley, however, was very conscientious of my unique needs and took the time to explain his treatment very thoroughly to me, even drawing some simple diagrams. He seems to be extremely knowledgeable (I think he said he has been a dentist for about 37 years) and willing to put in the time his patients need in order to get the best results and to understand their dental health. I am THRILLED to have found him.  "

3307,40224,2.0,"Was late for intial consult (16 hours late). Spent a total of 15 minutes with the patient describing a procedure that had serious risks. Did not consult with the patient prior to the scheduled procedure. Patient was life-flighted--before surgery--due to complications that arose under the doctor's harmful and absent care. The risky procedure ended up not being performed. Another doctor reviewed the patient's charts, ran more tests and found the root of the problem--no risky surgery needed. Unfortunately, patient was left with diminished kidney functioning. "
3308,40225,0.0,"I really like Dr. Molina's bedside manner.  He is very calm and straight forward.  I wasn't very impressed with his staff in his Charleston office, however.  They are not very friendly, and as a matter of fact, my PCP wanted to make a new referral for a new problem, and the billing dept called me to make sure that I paid a $7.50 balance at that scheduled appt.  I had just received my bill for my post op appt.  Prior to my surgery, I was called by the same dept, and was told four days prior to my surgery that I had to pay over $600 down, or had to reschedule my surgery.  The woman stated that she had just checked with my insurance company, and that was my share.  I immediately called my insurance company, and the woman was totally incorrect.  My share was only $80.  But, I had to pay that share with a credit card or I couldn't have my surgery.  Because of these practices, if I ever have anymore orthopedic issues, I will go to another doctor.  "
3309,40225,0.0,"I cannot say enough regarding this doctor. He diagnosed my mother with bone cancer about 12 or so years ago.

Thanks Dr. Molina for kindness and compassion! "

He gets upset when one of the other kids &quot;gets&quot; to go see Dr. Momen and he doesn't get to go. When all three (at that time 3 years, 4 months, and 4 months) had to be admitted to the hospital for a few days due to a respiratory infection, he went out of his way to make things as easy and comfortable as possible for us, including making arrangements for all 3 kids to be in the same room. Any time I call with a concern, I am given information or an appointment very quickly. Follow-up phone calls are often part of illness treatment, and are handled by Dr. Momen personally, not a nurse. Also, immunizations are administered by Dr. Momen, not a nurse. I wouldn't trust my kids to anyone but the best. That is why they are patients of Dr.  Joseph Momen! "

3321,40232,1.0,I love this doctor...I've went to him for years and he ALWAYS goes the extra mile to see to my needs...I wanted contacts but have stigmatism in one eye and he was willing at NO extra cost to try every style on me until we found the best one for me...Years ago I had that infection in my eyes due to the bad batch of one of the eye care products on the market and nearly was blind with the infection.  I was sent away by regular doctors but Dr. Mann stood by me and made sure I got better and barely charged me anything.  I was nearly blind for a time with this condition and he was always there.  now I'm fully covered.  I highly recommend this doctor. 
3322,40233,1.0,"I thought Dr. Mena was extremely knowledgeable.  He knew what tests to run according to the symptoms i told him, without hesitation; while no other doctor was able to give be a hint about my condition.  Dr. Mena diagnosed me with those blood tests and is now doing long term treatment.  I would recommend him, i did to my mother.  "
3323,40233,1.0,Doesn't seem to know very much about his specialty. He's good only for prescribing Armour thyroid meds.  
3324,40234,1.0,you are right dr manchin is only in it for the money.  he doesn't listen or care about his patients. i had a back injury and was sent to chriropracter who wouldn't even work on me but dr manchin would only toss me off to one of his cro0nies.  no meds at all....  
3325,40234,1.0,"This was my first visit; only went to make appointment. Doctor seen me and before I departed I was examined, all tests were done, and all meds were corrected. This was after other doctors had my  meds messed up. Also I was referred to a top heart doctor since my heart and blood pressure is a top issue.The doctor is a no nonsense doctor and knows his business. He didn't waste my time and I like him personally. I am thankful that he cares about his patients; others who I have went to could learn from this doctor.  "
3326,40234,1.0,"Dr. Manchin is in medicine to make money, plain &amp; simple. He makes you set up appointments to get test results to simply be told everything is fine. He makes you repeat tests unnecessarily. My family went through a very traumatic experience thinking something was wrong with my husband because Dr. Manchin kept ordering tests and not giving much explanation. We were only left to do internet research which had us convinced that he was going to die within 5 years. Come to find out, the tests were unnecessary. I wouldn't recommend seeing Dr. Manchin unless you enjoy being worried unnecessarily about your health &amp; spending more money that you need to. "

3330,40236,1.0,I went to this Dr. for over 10 years and I knew the entire time he was abusing drugs.  He finally got caught but still has the ability to practice. My wife double checked every Dx I was given. He is on probation with the AMA. He has violated his probation 1 time that I know of. Will never go back to him!!! Plus the office schedules patients at 10:00am but they know he will not arrive until after 1:00pm. Office staff allowed his drug abuse by not reporting him. 
3331,40237,0.0,Dr was rude and threatning to my 63 year Mother.  He kicked her out of the office after performing lasik surgery without protecting her eye because she could not afford the expensive eye drops he wanted to prescribe.

This man has been able to help so many with medical problems and all of us out here need to thank him and do all we can to help him. He has given his all for us, let us band together and do all we can for him. Get signatures on petitions whatever it takes, lets go.  "
3340,40240,1.0,Dr.Masih is a great doctor. I have had knee problems for years now and he has helped me a great deal. He so kind and knowledgeable....

3344,40240,1.0,"This is without a doubt the most knowledgable, caring and driven physician I have ever been to. I say knowledgable because he has been able to diagnose anything that me, my friends and family have brought to his attention. Caring because he has a genuine concern for his patients and their ailments, even during a chaotic day he is constantly apologetic for how busy the clinic is. He really does have a heart of gold and many other doctors should aspire to his caliber. I say driven because he will not hesitate once second to run any and all tests it takes to get to the root of your problem rather than just writing it off as something simple and assume the patient is overexagerating like most other doctors do. Obviously having a startup is going to be hectic which will eventually take care of themselves as they work together as a team but I will admit that it seems that his wife causes quite a bit of chaos on her own.  "
3345,40240,1.0,I like Dr. Masih alot to me he is a great doctor and takes care of your problem.  I would and will recommend him to all my friends and family 
3346,40240,1.0,"This is the best clinic I've ever been to.  They genuinely care about their patients.  Starting a practice is a very difficult thing to do, but they are a definite success.  It is also very hard to put together a staff who work together and are a team.  Through some attempts, this has happened as well.  Dr. Masih and his lovely wife have helped so many people.  People who had no where else to go.  It is unfortunate that those who were only trying to use this wonderful couple find it necessary to bash them and their services.  West Virginia is so lucky to have this clinic and this wonderful family to count among our own.  "
3347,40240,1.0,"Always wants to prescribe narcotics for pain, but does change the prescription when I complain.  "
3348,40240,1.0,"I have been a patient of Dr. Masih's for several years. He is an outstanding Doctor, I have always been treated with respect by him and his staff. For those who are bashing his wife..I have met her and she is very nice and respectful. I have suffered sometimes debilitating migraines and there were times when I could barely hold my head up and Dr. Masih took me straight back instead of making me wait for several hours. He immediately treated my migraine. He is very kind and considerate and he has a great staff.  "
3349,40240,1.0,I had a heartattack and he flew me to winchester and he had the heartattack stopped in 30 mins and all I had to pay was 60.00 sixty dallors 
3350,40240,1.0,"I have been seeing Dr. Rajan Masih for over a year now, he is awesome, always friendly and very helpful and genuinely concerned. His wife is an inconciderate ****! Most of the staff are young kids, rude and inconciderate but Raj is great if they let you talk to him. He needs his wife out of there she is very jealous of pretty young girls and is rude to his patients. I tolerate this only to see him because he has helped me soo much. Go Raj! "

3354,40241,1.0,This doctor has a terrible bed-side manner.  He was very arrogant and condescending when attempting to answer to questions for a terminal pancreatic cancer patient.  He was very vague with the patient and family regarding the type of cancer and possible treatment options/lack thereof.  He did not attempt to explain the full ramifications of the chemotherapy that he recommended for treatment.

3363,40247,1.0,He is a very good surgeon and he helped me with my back as quickly has possible after all tests were run. He was so very nice and he even prays for his patients before he does surgery on them.  
3364,40248,1.0,"Made a crown for tooth .. it hurt for a year .. could not fix it.  Made me feel very uncomfortable.   when it was too much to take, finally went back again to complain and said if he was going to charge me again to do NOTHING.  He said he would not charge me.   Was very rough and hurt me then I got a BILL anyway.  Horrible, mough still is awful and it has been over 2 years.  Can not afford to have it redone because insurance will only pay their portion once very 5 years.  He ruined my mouth.   DO NOT GO THERE.  Bad dentist and a liar.  "
3365,40248,1.0,Unprofessional and lack of customer service skills. 
3366,40248,1.0,".  I USED SEVERAL DENTIST BEFORE  I FOUND HIM.  HE AND HIS STAFF ARE THE BEST YOU CAN GET.  I TRUST NO OTHER.  HE REALLY KNOWS WHAT HE IS DOING, IS UP TO DATE ON ALL PROCEDURES.  HE HAS EVEN COME TO THE OFFICE ON THE WEEKEND TO SEE ME FOR AN EMERGENCY.  HIS FEES REASONABLE.  I THINK HE IS A GREAT DENTIST. "
3367,40248,1.0,Dr McWatters showed a lack of professionalism when my daughter had gone to a different dentist after she tried calling & leaving messages with his  answering service (later to hear from him that they had been having problems getting messages).  He made a point to tell me he was mad at her --- then when she came to her next appointment he was rude to her in front of his staff & then on my 2nd visit after this - he again mentioned that he was mad at my daughter -- we both had explained how much pain she was in & it was due  to him delaying treatment in the first place -- he needs to get over being mad at his patients & treat them with respect --- we have both gone on to different dentists -- we could not have stayed with his office & felt secure that we would have received the best care any longer.  we have gone to him for years & I was very disappointed in his actions. 
3368,40249,2.0, 
3369,40249,2.0,"Had to keep calling office for over a month to get test results.  Was told that results would be mailed with no opportunity to talk to doctor about what results mean.  Every time I call the office, I am put on hold, over and over, for 20 minutes or more.  I will now have to take my test results to my family doctor and pay for another visit to have my results explained to me. "
3370,40249,2.0, 
3371,40250,1.0,"Dr Mullen is the best of the best.He gets to know his patients and really cares about them,he is very over worked but still keeps his appointments and takes time to discuss your problems throughly which helps leads to his being late for the next appointment. But I'm sure his patients all know how blessed they are to have such a great and caring Doc that a little wait is well worth it "
3372,40250,1.0,"Dr. Mullen is very knowledgeable and thorough.  Even though he is terribly overworked (due to his expertise in critical care), he takes time to listen, asks and answers questions and focuses his energy on the patient.  You can tell he has a passion for medicine.  This man was born to be a physician.  "
3373,40250,1.0,Dr. Mullen is a fantastic Dr. He makes you his primary concern.  He is an acceptional physician and is a true blessing.  
3374,40251,1.0,"He is a great doctor and is now located in Martinsburg, WV.  So glad to have him here. "
3375,40251,1.0,"dr mac is the best!  Caring, great bed side manner and very knowlegable. "
3376,40252,1.0,Dr. Mosman is the best doctor I have ever dealt with and theres been many. He is very friendly and helpful. He has been my sons doctor since birth and my son is now 5. I recommend him to all the new parents.  
3377,40252,1.0,"I absolutely adore Dr. Mosman and so do my children.  He is a fantastic physician with a true love for his patients.  His knowledge is unmatched, and I trust his opinion greatly.  He never rushes the appointment and he truly takes the time to hear all of your concerns.  More doctors could take a lesson from him.  I would recommend him to anyone looking for a pediatrician. "
3378,40252,1.0,Both Dr. Mossman and Dr. Reuben are wonderful doctors. They are always responsive to the needs of my family 
3379,40252,1.0,"Both Dr. Mosman and Dr. Ruben are fantastic! They will listen to your concerns and take as much time needed to explain things in detail. I have also called for sick visits a few times and have always gotten an appointment that day, in fact, a lot of times they told me to come right in! My kids love them, I would recommend them to anyone.  "
3380,40252,1.0,"Dr. Mosman is a wonderful doctor.  He is great with my daughter, always takes time to talk with you.  It's easy to see he really cares about the kids he is taking care of.  I wouldn't go anywhere else. "
3381,40252,1.0,"The first time I visited Dr. Mosman's office, I was immediately put at ease. The staff is friendly, and the doctor is exceptionaly good with small children. I've always felt comfortable calling in with questions, and never feel rushed when I'm in the office with my kids. I highly recommend this pediatrician.  "
3382,40252,1.0,Dr. Mosman is very thorough and professional. I would recommend him to my friends. 
3383,40252,1.0,Excellent rapport with small children. Very accessible during those off-hours problems that come up so often with kids of the same age. 
3384,40254,0.0,"Dr. Milhoan is a very nice & caring doctor with a staff that is just as helpful. I haven't had any problems with any of them but I also know that everyone can have an &quot;off&quot; day. As for the comment regarding the copay, you are aware of owing this before the doctor sees you, I understand that it can also be forgotten but you don't go to a restaurant/grocery store & not pay when it's time to check out. Give the office staff a break. She is only doing her job & that office really gets hecktic. "
3385,40254,0.0,"I'm a client of a different caliber but he has saved my life twice now. If he doesn't know something he gets the right doctor in to help. He is awesome; however, if you have a co-pay make sure you have a means of payment with you. The other day a mother of two small children, both with her, was getting a rash over forgetting her $30 co-pay. The woman explained she was rushed getting out the door and had just forgotten it. She went on to say she lived 3 blocks away and would bring it right back. The worker went on an on and on. He needs to get rid of her, but he is great. LOVE RN GEORGIA! Great personality! "
3386,40254,0.0,"I would recommend Dr. Milhoan to anyone.  He is very knowledgeable and has a wonderful bedside manner. He is wonderful with my children and honestly cares about you as a patient.  Like any other physician he can be pressed for time and in a hurry, but despite this he takes the time to answer your questions.  "
3387,40254,0.0,He is very smart and has a wonderful beside manner. He is also double board certified in both Internal Medicine and Pediatrics. He stays up-to-date on all the latest information. He is very sensible when talking to the patient or child by putting information in terms that can be understood.

3389,40256,2.0,great staff doctor takes plenty of time explaining everything 
3390,40256,2.0,Dr Mills is a good doctor but I waited for almost 2 hours (with a scheduled appointment) to see the doctor.  
3391,40257,2.0,Excellent doctor. Very kind and patient.  
3392,40258,1.0,"Dr. Miller has improved my life dramatically, and in only 6 months.  I came to him at the lowest point, slightly agoraphobic and fearful of losing my job after a dismal performance evaluation.  Now I have been promoted, and little setbacks no longer ruin my day.  He is the ultimate &quot;friend in deed&quot;.  "
3393,40258,1.0,Dr. Miller is great. I struggled with other physicians to help relieve the pain in my knee. I went to see him in a month I was scheduled for surgery  and the pain relief was there. A knee that hurt constantly every day know does not hurt constantly. He is a no mess around kind of doctor. Let's do and get on the way to recovery. I highly recommend him.  He explains everything and his staff is so helpful!!! 
3394,40258,1.0,Dr. Miller is a very nice and educated doctor. i would use his services again 
3395,40259,2.0,they are terrible un cardinal Ped. Staff messes up appointments and Dr. treats moms like they are stupid...They are just terrible there! 
3396,40260,0.0,"I had to switch doctors because of a long distance move and chose Dr. McCammon. She has delivered 3 of my children, and I'm very happy with her. She's always helpful and informative. I've talked my friends into going to her as well, and they have never had an issue as well! I highly recommend her.  "
3397,40261,1.0,He talked a lot of jabber...if you had pain after an adjustment...it was because of something you did not him...Just a crazy experience 
3398,40262,1.0,"I went to Dr. Minor numerous times with the same complaint and everytime he took blood and sent me on my way. Days later a staff member would call me and say I have elivated white cell count and it MUST be an inner ear infection. I asked numerous times if we could get to the bottom of this cause I have no other symptoms and how are these antibiotics not getting rid of it. They argued with me and insisted it was an ear infection. I went to another doctor, told them the issues, they sent me to a specialist and I had a bacterial infection that required tageting antibiotics to get rid of it. 4 Appointment, 4 blood drawn, 4 co-payments, 4 lab fees, 4 needless prescriptions.... and all I needed was a doctor to show intrest 1 time! "
3399,40262,1.0,"Went to him for 15 years. I would stay with him, but it will be too much of a trip from Florida.  He is very caring about his patients. He is also current on new procedures.  "
3400,40263,0.0,She is a great doctor! Really cares and always listens to you 
3401,40264,1.0,"Very good doctor, not only cares about yur eyes, but if he notices a condition like high cholestoral, he advises you to see your personal doctor. "
3402,40264,1.0,"This doctor diagnoses everyone with cataracts, and makes it sound like you are going to go blind.  Do not go to this doctor!! "
3403,40265,0.0,She is a good doctor. Available for new patients. Listens and understands. She is thorough. I would recommend her to other working professional women.  
3404,40266,0.0,left my mother sitting for hours in a cold waiting room and then only gave her 1 minute of his time. 
3405,40267,1.0,"One of the best doctors I've experienced, even if he is at a place that is generally not well run.  "
3406,40267,1.0,"GREAT, GREAT, GREAT! KNOWS HIS STUFF-HE COULD DO PROCEDURES BLINDFOLDED-HE IS THAT GOOD.  NICE MAN! "
3407,40268,0.0,"Jennifer is soft-spoken, but she is also very patient and kind.  The entire office is wonderful.  It doesn't matter whom we might have to see if Jennifer is unavailable, any one of them has already examined or been made aware of what is going on with your child.  It is absolutely wonderful how they all work together, and form second or third opinions when necessary.  Not to mention, they all are very good with children, and my son has never cried when he realized we were going to his pediatrician's office.  The only negative comment I have concerning Jennifer and the treament of my son is that I feel she prescribes antibotics too frequently, after too-many-to-count ear infections and countless antibiotics, I had to specifically request to be referred to a specialist to try and get the problem resolved.  Other than that, I have nothing but good things to say about Jennifer and the whole team at this office. "
3408,40268,0.0,"Although my kids are regularly patients of Dr. Joseph Momen, they have seen Dr. Jennifer Momen many times. She seems to be an excellent doctor. One thing I love about their practice is that they will often call one another in and quickly go over the situation at hand, to get a kind of &quot;in house&quot; second opinion and in the event that something comes up subsequently and the other doctors are on call, they know the situation. Dr. Momen also makes her own follow-up calls, instead of having them made by a nurse. The only slight criticism I would have of her is that she speaks very softly. Normally, that might not matter, but for a mother who sometimes has a screaming child (or two!) on her lap while trying to listen to the doctor's diagnosis and instructions, that soft-spoken voice is very difficult to hear. I guess if that is the only criticism you have for a doctor, she must be doing pretty well. Overall, I would easily recommend Dr. Jennifer Momen to friends and family.  "
3409,40268,0.0,"Jennifer is a wonderful doctor.  She is polite and listens to her patients.  We left an incredible doctor in California when we moved here and we were very apprehensive about finding a new one.  She seemed a little nervous the first year, but she's an incredible doctor so far.  Joseph Momen helps her out, which should rest anyone's conscience about her young age.  We feel very fortunate to have found such excellent doctors!  Very lucky indeed.  "
3410,40269,1.0,"I think DR Meadows is VERY LAZY! If your visit iscomplcated or he has to fill out any paper work then it wont get done,find another DR.  "
3411,40270,1.0,One would be advised to stay away from this Doctor.  
3412,40270,1.0,Lied about my wife and made up stories and falsified health records.  
3413,40270,1.0,. Helpful with my problems knew what I was going thru and made insightful comments about my injury and the overall outcome 
3414,40270,1.0,Don't trust this doctor. He doesn't tell the truth.  
3415,40271,1.0,Excellent Doctor!I'd drive 500 miles to see him if I had to....... just a GREAT doctor!! 
3416,40272,0.0,I never have a problem getting in to see Dr. Miller. Her staff is very helpful and polite and she is very approachable. She is not afraid to refer you to a specialist if the diagnosis is beyond her scope. I would highly recommend her to anyone in the Glenville area. 
3417,40272,0.0,She is a very careful thoughtful Dr if shes not sure of her diagnosis she always refers you to someone she is knowledgeable of.Our family love her and if she was to leave Glenville i would follow. 
3418,40273,2.0,"ALL ABOUT MONEY WITH THESE GUYS!!HAD SEVERAL PROCEDURES PERFORMED THAT MY INSURANCE DID NOT COVER. WAS NEVER ADVISED THAT MY INSURANCE MAY NOT COVER THEM, THEN WAS STUCK WITH A VERY HIGH BILL. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS DENTIST TO MY WORST ENEMY.  "
3419,40274,1.0,"I had to get a PTK laser surgery on my left eye in the spring of 2009.  Dr. Mayle and his staff are very helpful.  My only complaint is that I had to go all the way to Morgantown to have the procedure done.  Other than the long drive, I was very happy.  They took the time to talk with me and explain everything. "
3420,40275,0.0,On several different occassions she has giving me incorrect information!!! She definately is a nice enough person but it takes more than that. 
3421,40276,2.0,The staff is friendly and they are good with children.  They are also very good at giving you an appointment in the near future. If they are running late they will make sure you know.  They also don't push for unnecessary procedures.  
3422,40277,0.0,"Dr. Miller and her staff make dental visits very pleasant. The office is very organized and peaceful and the staff are all friendly. I've had cleanings and a filling done at this office, everything has gone well. For over a year, she's been watching a questionable tooth. It ended up turning into a cavity and she filled it, but she didn't fix it until the work needed to be done. She is thorough and has rationales to back up the information she gives. I've previously seen 5 other dentists and had a good deal of dental work, so I have others to compare Dr. Miller to. Thankfully, I've found the best dentist! Wouldn't want to see any other dentist, she's outstanding! "
3423,40278,0.0,Really cares about her patients! Great physician! 
3424,40279,1.0,Dr. Joe is simply the best pediatrician I have ever used.  I have three kids and he is equally kind and caring to all of them.   The entire staff at ABC is professional and I think they are great! 
3425,40279,1.0,"I feel he is a good Dr. but the wait was never fun. After repetitive sexual comments to myself (positions for concieveing a son, comments about my breast while breastfeeding, referring to a Pavlik harness as looking like a medieval sex device, etc) we switched to another group where I'm much happier. I also did not like that a person didn't answer the phone and you had to press this # for one thing, then another # for something else. It would take hours for a return call. I did like their office hours, working in the evenings and weekends.  "
3426,40279,1.0,My children love Dr. Joe!! I never have a problem when I tell them they need to go see Dr. Joe.  He is terrific with the children and is always going above and beyond the call of duty.  He is what every Doctor should strive to be! 
3427,40279,1.0,"Dr. Joe is wonderful. He is caring, responsive, explains anything you need and does so - so that anyone can understand. He has an excellent bedside manner and is not only professional but friendly. My kids all love him. He is the best pediatrician I have found since my older kids were little (my kids are 19,17,16,4 &amp; 2) I recommend him to anyone and everyone. I think he is excellent. All of my kids go there and all of them feel very comfortable with him. A++++ "
3428,40279,1.0,"Dr Matusic has been taking care of my kids for 13 years. He is AWESOME!!! i gave him 1 point off for punctuality, but when you are this good you are in high demand- he sometimes gets behind but i feel that is because he is more concerned with making sure everything is covered and understood. "
3429,40279,1.0,"Dr Joe is wonderful. The best. I recommend him everywhere I go. He is very knowledable, great with kids, wonderful with parents. I have kids from the ages of 17 years down to 10 months. He does great with them all. They all enjoy him. I highly recommend him.  "
3430,40279,1.0,"best pediatrician I have ever dealt with...great staff, too. "
3431,40279,1.0,"Dr. Joe is an excellent doctor. He is VERY knowledgable, LOVES kids and is an all around GREAT person! I appreciate his concern for his patients care and not so much about the money. "
3432,40280,0.0,"Not only was I kept waiting for over an hour in the waiting room, but waited for another 20 minutes inside an office, while I could HEAR Dr. Morris across the hall, talking to his other patient about her diagnosis and treatment.  He is SO loud,it's got to be a HIPPA violation.  He was rude, unhelpful, and spoke to me like I was a child (and a deaf child, at that!) "
3433,40281,1.0,"i,have encountered this doctor two times each time 7yrs apart.his last name says it all .the first time he was rude and made belittling remarks!much to my dismay ,i once again was blessed with his presence in a different hospital,unbelievably,he hadn't changed he was rude and demeaning.just what i needed lying there suffering,the doctor telling me that i was being sick on purpose!oh , no ! don't delete this ,somebody needs to know this!there is something wrong with this man! "
3434,40282,1.0,"Very good, very nice doctor.  He helped me a lot.  He didn't just give me a prescription for something, he actually investigated the problem and treated me appropriately.  He did not overmedicate me but he gave me exactly what I needed.  He was always pleasant and knowledgeable.  He's a good listener.  I'm sorry I lost my insurance; if I hadn't I would still be going to him. "
3435,40282,1.0,"Very nice person, always pleasant. Prescribes appropriate treatment. Does not over medicate but will prescribe what is needed. Overall an excellent doc. "
3436,40283,1.0,"I have Chiari,All the treatment in 17 yrs. I have received from him is &quot;Walk 5 steps for me&quot;, THATS IT!,2 wks ago he disappeared in the middle of the office visit,after sev. min's I looked for him and I was told &quot;He left,He had a Dentist appo.&quot;...THATS SO RUDE AND NOT PROFESSIONAL..a week later I asked 4 a referral to OSU and I was told,..&quot;Dr.Morehead will not give you the referral&quot;.,He Grad. in 1970,,HE CLEARLY DOES NOT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT CHIARI, I HAD TO LEARN IT THE HARD WAY!..I'm GETTING real HELP now, With no help from whats his name!  (shame on him!) "
3437,40283,1.0,I did not find this doctor helpful.  I felt he gave me no guidance on the proper steps to take.  If he had some reason for his lack of advice/assistance I have no clue what it was.  I felt that the questions my parents asked were answered more by me than by him. 
3438,40284,1.0,He is a 10. 
3439,40285,1.0,he is a fine person an he did a great job yes i do mention their was a little pain but compared too what it would be like without the treatment. 
3440,40285,1.0, 
3441,40285,1.0,"He is a nice, personable gentleman. The treatments are too much, and my gums hurt afterword. His breath wasn't that pleasant, and I question the sterilization of the instruments. When I was there last he had no one in the office but him, and the time in between me and the previous patient was very soon. I don't care about punctuality as much as quality health care. "
3442,40285,1.0,"He is very impatient and rough on the gums. I would rather have had an appointment with the proctologist. Also, can you say poor house and a home equity loan&#63; "
3443,40286,1.0,"EXCELLENT doctor.  Cares so much for his patients.  There have been a couple of times in the years we have gone to him that either my husband or I have had a particularly stubborn problem and one time he called us to check on us and the other time encouraged us to call back from a trip if not better and he'd work with us long-distance.  Incredible.  As mentioned before, if he doesn't no what's wrong, he refers to someone who does.  I've never had him just ignore a patient's concerns.  The only drawback (which is the case with most every doctor) is the occasional lengthy wait to get in.  Always spends as much time as necessary with his patients to hear them and recommend a course of treatment. "
3444,40286,1.0,PLEASE BE CAREFUL IF YOUR ACCEPTED AS A NEW PATIENT. I WAS TOLD HE WOULD ACCEPT ME IF I GOT MY RECORDS. I PAID TO GET MY RECORDS TO FIND OUT THAT HE WOULDNT TAKE ME BECAUSE HE FELT HE COULDNT ACCOMIDATE MY NEEDS.NOW I HAVE NO DOCTOR.I THOUGHT THAT DOCTORS TAKE AN OATH TO HELP PEPLE IF THEY CANT ACCEPT YOU THEY SHOULDNT SAY THEY WILL THEN CHANGE THERE MIND.HE HAS DONE THIS TO OTHERS. 
3445,40286,1.0,Dr. Mason is the most caring and helpful doctor that I haev ever went to.  He is never in a hurry and no matter what question you ask him you will not feel stupid for asking it.  He has helped me both physically and mentally.  Always caring how I am feeling and also ask about my family.  He treats my husband also and we both just love him alot.   I am just so thankful that I was able to be one of his patients 
3446,40286,1.0,"he takes his time and if he doesnt know the answer he'll send you to some one who can. he's very efficient and professional, yet caring.  "
3447,40286,1.0,"You will never find a better doctor in his area! He is intelligent, caring, empathetic and take time to listen to everything you have to say. He never rushes people out the door, yet I rarely have to wait long. His staff is just as great in their roles. I am a tough critic and generally mention any and all shortfalls during a review, but Dr. Mason and his staff are 110% A+ in every area. A doctor is a person you literally trust with your life. Past doctors have not always made me feel like I can do that, but Dr. Mason is one of the best...not only in his town but I'd put him against any MD in the country. I found this site while looking for his phone number. I didn't set out to write a review. But he deserves professional praise. "
3448,40287,1.0,Great doctor...great staff.... LOUSY wait times! More than an hour every single time is just silly 
3449,40287,1.0,"I first met Dr. Marra 14 years ago in the ER, when my nephew broke his wrist. He was polite and very informative. I have since been working with him for the past 11 years, I will tell you this. Dr. Marra is a very intelligent and professional person, he is straight forward and honest. If he tells you there is nothing he can do and refers you to someone else, then he is just being honest, would you rather he do something that is out of his scope of practice and screw your foot up&#63; Im sure you would really have something to complain about then, believe it or not, not every surgeon can do every procedure! Dr. Marra keeps up with the latest medical information, he takes all precautions to prevent infections and to provide the best care he can. I would trust him with myself or any member of my family. "
3450,40287,1.0,"Dr.Marra is the best, there is no one else in this area that I would consider going to. He fixed my ankle and I am back to work and just fine! "
3451,40287,1.0,Dr. Marra was professional and knowledgable. I have a friend who works as a surgeon at the same hospital. All the other surgeons go to Dr Marra to fix their broken bones and torn ligaments.  
3452,40287,1.0,"I have read these reviews and feel the need to respond to them.  Dr. Marra replaced my knee in 2008.  I recently went to my 41st class reunion and boogied the night away.  You can't do that with a knee that doesn't work.  He is very informative and will spend as much time with you as you need.  If you have no questions, you only get the time needed for him to explain what he thinks you need to answer your problem.  If you have more questions, for crying out loud ask them.  He is very amiable and his patients love him because of these reasons.  The time spent in his waiting room is mostly due to the time he takes with patients who need it.  How many specialists have you people seen&#63;  The waiting room time is ALWAYS long!! At least we all seem to agree on one thing, the staff is GREAT!!  As for referring people to someone else, isn't it refreshing to know that a doctor doesn't keep you coming back if it is a problem that he doesn't ususally deal with&#63;&#63;  That would make me happy. "
3453,40287,1.0,"I recently broke my ankle and needed surgery to fix it, I work at the hospital and Dr. Marra was the only person I wanted to fix me, I am healing really well, and could not be happier with my care, the office staff was wonderful. I would recommend Dr. Marra to anyone who needs an orthopedic surgeon! He is the best "
3454,40287,1.0,". dr marra saved my arm but he was quit havent the no personality but i tore my acl 2 times and i got a caadaver in it but if i was u i would go to cleveland clinic and go to dr, richard parker dont get my e wong ddr marra is a good doctor "
3455,40287,1.0,"Last October, Dr. Marra operated on my shoulder which had been damaged badly in a fall.  He explained everything as it arose and was forthcoming with any explanations.  My shoulder surgery is 10 months old.  Except for minor twinges, I have no problems.  I can raise my arm above my head with no pain.  Prior to the surgery, I couldn't raise it beyond my waistline.  I didn't expect nor require a warm, fuzzy relationship, but I did want clear, concise explanations and directions.  Dr. Marra fulfilled those expections.  I followed his directions precisely and the physical therapy was beneficial.  "
3456,40287,1.0,"Dr. Marra did surgery on my left knee.  I had 2 meniscus tears, arthritis and spers.  Before surgery he explained everything he would be doing.  He was very straight forward, informative, intentive and I felt very comfortable with him.  After surgery he should me before and after films and told me exactly what he had to do.  I went to physical therapy and then went back to see him.  He told me it would probably take 6 months for me to really see a difference.  April will be a year and the pain is gone (except when it rains) and it is mild.  His bedside manner was great.  I will definitely go back to him if I have anymore problems.  "
3457,40287,1.0,"As a physical therapist working in sports medicine and rehab for over 16 years, I have dealt with many  orthopedic surgeons, surgery outcomes and the rehab process.  I chose Dr. Marra for my ACL reconstruction and could not have been happier.  I am now 6 months post-op and nearly 95% recovered. As I write this, I have just finished 10 miles on my stationary bike and jogging 1.5 miles on my treadmill.  Dr. Marra is not the type to &quot;sugar coat&quot; anything and is known to be straight forward.  He was caring and attentive and I feel I received the best of care.     P.S.  Make sure you follow your physical therapy precisely! "
3458,40287,1.0,"He was extremely rude. He looked at my foot and said he didn't know what to do. Referred me to another doctor. However, very friendly staff excluding him. "
3459,40287,1.0,Dr. Marra stated that my sons problem was in our heads and not real. He was very rude and did not help at all. My son has been receiving care through Easter Seals for years. I sincerely doubt that out of all the doctors he has seen in the last 10 years that they all were &quot;fooled&quot; by our &quot;phychosomatic&quot; problems. Dr. Marra is the only one who could not do anything for us. 
3460,40287,1.0,VERY pleased with my care at Dr. Marra's office. Friendly staff---super nurse---great doctor. Would recommend him highly.  
3461,40297,0.0," She is very personable, and takes great care in listening to each complaint you may have. She doesn't seem hurried, and even though you may be in the office for embarrasing conditions, she makes u feel at home. Def. recommended.  "
3462,40297,0.0," Dr. Saber and staff are amazingly wonderful! Helpful, kind, accurate and Efficient! Dr. to my Grandmother and Great Aunt! Thank you for taking such good care of them! "
3463,40297,0.0," Dr. Saber, What a doctor! If she is your family doctor you know she is willing to do every thing she can to get you better. She has been willing to go out of her way to see me the same day. I have given her name to all of my friends who are in need of a doctor.  After all friends and family deserve the best too! "
3464,40297,0.0," Dr. Saber is a wonderful person and physican.  Our family loves her and the nurses, but we are considering leaving because the office manager (betty) is a total ****.  Everything with her evolves around money, and she has absolutly no people skills or compassion.  Dr. Saber would do well to replace her.  "
3465,40297,0.0," Kind and compassionate, receptive to new ideas and research. Enabled me to go back to work after 8 years. Not an expert on fibromyalgia but willing to help me set my own course thereby helping handle chronic pain, sciatica, migraines, IBS and other conditions that had rendered me incapacitated. She is wonderful! "
3466,40301,0.0,.  to me she is a wonderful doctor and has been the one to look at both of my broken and said i need sugry 
3467,40301,0.0, Dr. Salgado is GREAT!!!! I have 3 children that love her!! 
3468,40301,0.0, She has been a wonderful Dr. for my children. She is very caring towards them and very helpful. 
3469,40305,0.0," I have seen her for years.  She is knowleadeable, open, and efficient.  "
3470,40305,0.0," I disagree entirely with the previous review. Dr. Rosenberger was wonderful when I took my 6 month old son to see her. After many failed visits to his Pedi with a bright red rash, only to be given several explanations and a scary diagnosis, Dr. Rosenberger took one look at him and said &quot;So you are here to get him treated for eczema&#63;&quot; She knew within 10 seconds of walking in the room what was wrong with him. She is a wonderful and caring doctor. She also gave us plenty of samples and a discount card to help with a pricey (but very effective) prescription.  I would recommend her to anyone! "
3471,40305,0.0," She did not address my concerns, and she haphazardly rushed me through a 2-minute exam that left me feeling like I had completely wasted my time.  The pamphlets in her waiting room advertised plenty of fancy cosmetic services, but she seemed unwilling to provide actual health care for my real medical concern.  Obviously, this person is a cosmetic salesman, not a real doctor. "
3472,40306,2.0, Very friendly and helpful. Great doctor...better man.  
3473,40310,1.0," I first discovered Dr Saxe on the internet by accident. He is the best doctor that I have ever had! I really feel in my heart that he was God sent! I have been going to him for 5+ years. He isn't the type of doctor that is worried about how many patients that he can rush through his office in one day for the $$$$$. He actually CARES about his patients. I have never met another one like him. He is wonderful! I never have to wait over 5 or 10 min. either.    Over the 5+ years that I have been going to him I have only came across one rude staff member and I haven't saw her for a while, so she might not even work there now. The satff is good also, but he is great! "
3474,40310,1.0, Dr. Saxe's bedside manner is very refreshing and his listening skills wonderful. I'm thankful for having him as my doctor.  
3475,40310,1.0," Dr. Saxe was a God-send to me. He helped me through years of suffering and debilitation, with a wonderful bedside manner and I received hope for a better day when with him. The quality of my life is much better now, because he cares about the whole person, not just the physical.  "
3476,40310,1.0, This Dr. converses with you and finds ways to help with your problem or will refer you to a specialist.  
3477,40319,1.0," Very knowledgeable, excellent surgeon, but has no personality. His staff is rude as is the doctor himself. "
3478,40321,1.0," This Doctor is very undependable, he never returns your calls, explains anything and never reviews your test result with you. "
3479,40321,1.0," This Man is the most Egotistical male I have ever had to deal with. Dealing with him during my Mothers stay in the hospital..after He sent her to a Surgeon for Lung Biopsy...he was Never helpful in dealing with the truth. The surgeon blotched my Moms operation....Doctor Saludes..knowing what went wrong...just pronounced her as being terminally ill...Because They, the medical team, had know clue as to how to help her....instead of helping us, her family,...he wasn't available for disgusting anything..only on his terms and we had to ask questions fast...horrible bedside manner...he should have referred her to Cleveland Hospital, but the Surgeon actually did this...or did he&#63;&#63; They all lied to cover up their deadly mistakes. We may never know the lies that went on for the two months after her Biopsy...too many inconsistencies.Please do not trust this man with your life. "
3480,40330,0.0," Dr. Savory is one of the best doctors I've ever seen. She has been my GP for the last several years and handled my first pregnancy last year. It was a high risk situation and she was with me every step of the way. She always took the time to explain all of the possibilities and options. Her staff always accommodated my scheduling issues and squeezed me in for emergencies. When I was hospitalized several times, she came to visit me every day or called to check in. She happened to be on vacation when I had to be induced and referred me to Dr. Adam Franks who was wonderful as well. As soon as she returned she stopped in to check on me and the baby. The only downside is the wait to see her. But that's only because she takes time with her patients and ensures all of their concerns are addressed before they leave. While it's inconvenient, I just try to remember the times I required more of her time and someone else was left waiting.  "
3481,40330,0.0, A doctor who truly cares and will step in to help others if you ask her too. I could not say enough good things. I would recommend to anyone.  
3482,40330,0.0," Dr. Savory has taken care of me and my family for over 20 years.  She delivered my children, and my grandchildren.  She cares about her patients like they were her family.  She even made home visits when my mother was sick and bed fast.  In my opinion she encompasses what a family practice physician is.  "
3483,40330,0.0," Dr Savory is the best physician I have ever seen. She is extremely punctual, you will not wait. She is a true professional, answers all questions and addresses all concerns.  "
3484,40330,0.0," linda savory has been excellent with me , my mother . my best friend  i would recommend her to anyone.  she always finds an answere for me and she is very polite and listens to me.  "
3485,40335,1.0, This Dr is one of the best he is honest and stright to the point he treat you with respect and he tells you like it is . 
3486,40335,1.0, hes super nice and knows what hes doing...... great doctor 
3487,40335,1.0," Very professional, but also treats you as a individual not just another patient. "
3488,40336,1.0, Have been seeing him for for appr. 14 years.  Has helped me.  Would recommend him to friends and family.  
3489,40339,2.0,".  Very knowledgeable and helpful,Very knowledgeable and helpful "
3490,40345,1.0," I used the state of WV insurance which is not on your list. Also, I would like to say that Dr. Saldanha is one of the finest I have ever had the privilege of having provided a service for me.  I would still be seeing him if my insurance would pay for the healthcare I need. He is great. "
3491,40348,0.0, Kind and honest but also straight forward. She does whats right for the child ( like not handing out antibiotics like they are candy ) and does not let parents bully her. Also open minded and does not harass parents regarding personal and religious views associated with healthcare.  
3492,40349,1.0, Nice as I can be. I saw him one time in 8 visits..  and that was to acknowledge it was ok..  for me to see a nurse practitioner instead.. whom was good..  but he failed to acknowledge I would be charged doctor fees of O agreed.  My Insurance paid him well.  
3493,40349,1.0, Attentative to patient's concern.  Friendly and personable.  Willing to discuss alternatives as well.  
3494,40352,1.0, He helped me immensely with exactly what I needed. I took his advice and saw a difference almost immediately. 
3495,40354,1.0,.  He is very intrested in his patient does refer you do a specialist if you need it - he listens cares and i always feel safe and trust him cant say that about many doctors today 
3496,40354,1.0," Forgetful, cannot remember from one visit to another what the patient's medical history is.  Office is a mess, old dirty, delapaitated building. Never treats patient, if there is a 'problem', he always refers the patient to a specialist.  Never on schedule.  I feel sorry for the nursing  home patients he takes care of.  "
3497,40355,1.0," Dr. Salman and his PA staff treat my 11 yr old grandson for adhd, (possible) aspergers, and anxiety, plus the other issues that are non specific. The Dr listens very intently to me and my concerns, and speaks to my grandchild in a manner he understands. My grandchild is very comfortable with Dr. Salman, which is a feat in itself. He does not experience any anxiety before his appointments. Overall, though his treatment is far from finished, I am very pleased. It has been literally life changing for my grandchild. His progress has been remarkable, and continues to improve. I am very grateful our pediatrician recommended Dr. Salman.  "
3498,40355,1.0," My situation is the same as the other person. Keeps prescribing me medications I have taken before and had a bad reaction/allergy to, and refuses to treat my anxiety. The medication I was on when I moved here worked just fine, but he just had to change all my medications around and screw me all up again, very lucky I didn't end up back in a mental hospital because of this jerk. Do not go here. "
3499,40355,1.0," He has a new office at the new United Health Hospital off Exit 124, I-79. His staff is excellent and he will stand his ground on his diagnosis, wheather you admit it to yourself or not.  This was irritating at first but eventually lead to my successful treatment and my acceptance of my Bi-Polar condition.  Very good doctor which makes him very popular and hard to get appointments.  He is doing better at seeing everyone but there are so many walk-ins it is difficult to manage and he will not turn anyone away.  "
3500,40355,1.0, Dr. Salman and his staff have been very helpful and attentive to my needs.  I would recommend him to others! 
3501,40355,1.0," This MD was very rude in general. After spending money on co-payments and what insurance does not cover, I am willing to try ANY other Dr. This person was unkowledgable, as he twice prescribed something I informed him I was allergic to and I am only worse after wasting my breath on trying to explain what I know does not help. Waste of time. "
3502,40360,0.0, I have been a patient of Dr. Sayer for about 5yrs. She is a very understanding and smart woman. I have recomended her to my family and friends. I think she is a wonderful Dr.  
3503,40360,0.0, I have recently started seeing this doctor and I think she is wonderful. Very helpful and caring. 
3504,40360,0.0," Dr. Sayre was very helpful and very attentive.  She listened to everything I had to say and seemed very sincere in her concern for my well-being.  I had an issue that I had gone to two other physicians for.  Both of those two physicians treated me but were unable to get my condition under control.  I went to her one time. She listened to me, reviewed my physical symptoms, my emotional symptoms and my environment into consideration and within two weeks after seeing her my symptoms were gone and I no longer needed any medications for the issue...the issue was resolved.  I highly recommend Dr. Sayre.  "
3505,40360,0.0, She has been wonderful to me and my health.  I think that people only want to put the bad out there and not the good.  More people should look for the good in people and quite being so negative!  She is an a wonderful Dr. and she will help you out in anyway that she can.  No one is perfect!  God is only God not Dr.'s or us.  I go to her and will continue.  Make an appt. and make your own opinion about her and not by reading/looking at the bad! 
3506,40360,0.0, you go to her and she says  there is nothing wrong 1- 2 days later you have to  go to the er because you are in so much pain and your ear is swelled shut   Definitely would not recommend.  
3507,40360,0.0," This physician, in my opinion, is extremely incompetent.  She appears to not be capable of making medical decisions on her own without the expert help of another more experienced physician or nurse.  Everytime you ask her a question, her response is always, &quot;I'll find that out for you, I am not really sure.&quot;  Did this doc even go to med school&#63;&#63;&#63;  Definitely would not recommend.  "
3508,40367,1.0," Dr. Saieed is wonderful!! He is the most caring, attentive doctor I've ever had.  His primary concern is always of his patients and their family.  I have called at various times to ask him questions regarding tests, more info needed on something, etc. and he always personally calls back, which is unheard of.  I have never felt as if I were being rushed in and out. . .he always takes the necessary time needed with his patients, and you just don't feel like &quot;a number&quot; as in other physicians offices.  I can't imagine not having him to rely on. . .I trust him completely and he has never failed me.  I've been a patient now for over 15 years.  He's the best! "
3509,40367,1.0, He's the best doctor I have ever had!  Always responds quickly to my needs.  Thank you.  
3510,40367,1.0, Very attentive and concerned about his patients. He never fails to follow through on checking the results on any testing that has been done.  
3511,40367,1.0, He is always very concerned with his patients and knows them all by name. 
3512,40367,1.0," At times Dr Saieed was helpful, but at the most critical time he was unhelpful to my parents and family.  He went vacation without insuring that adequate care would be given to my mother in his absense, even though my father had died just three weeks earlier.  My mother died two days later.  He also did not notify us of his departure, and who to contact during his absense. "
3513,40375,0.0," Dr. Sahloul was the worst doctor that I had ever had to see. She was so unconcerned about my medical issues that I couldn't believe she was a doctor. She didn't care what I was saying she would put up her hand and cut me off. She did not want to hear what I had to say. And when a tear ran down my face from frustration she told me I was depressed and that I should sit on my porch for a half an hour a day. I have Hashimotos disease, not depression. I personally know the difference. I wouldn't recommend her to anyone.  I'm sorry to say she's a poor doctor but in my case it's absolutely true. "
3514,40375,0.0, My husband has been going to Dr. Sahloul for about a year for his type II diabetes.   Dr. Sahloul has tried different medicines and now has it under control for the first time in 20 years.  We are very happy with the care we have received and very thankful for the improvement in his overall health.  
3515,40375,0.0, Very opinionated. Did not help me. Had to change doctors.  
3516,40380,1.0, The only complaint is that it is hard to get an appointment with him when you are sick. I usually end up going to an urgent care center when I get sick and just see Dr Salon on my scheduled appointments. 
3517,40386,2.0, I was not pleased with my care given. 
3518,40390,1.0," Having lost track of Dr. Watson when he left the Jane Lew area I was thrilled to find him again in the Glenville. Dr. Watson has always been courteous and professional. I can't imagine him treating anyone as stated in the previous remarks, unless he was correct resulting in such angry remarks.  Being someone who is reluctant to trust doctors Dr. Watson has always been understanding and helpful in his approach. I would recommend him without hesitation to anyone seeking a caring primary physician.   Lori D.  Jane Lew "
3519,40390,1.0," This Dr. is one of the most unsympothic dr's I have EVER SEEN!! Board needs to review this mans (persons) license BIG time!!! Let's a person leave with fatal infection and give them nothing, and no diagnioas. Was so rude w/me had me crying. NEVER EVER AGAIN!!! If you even mention a med you have taken..he assummes your a junkie..people could die from this person, he is at Glenville now at Minnie Hamilton. "
3520,40390,1.0,.  Lied to me about my diagnoses and dose is not very sympithetic twords pain issues 
3521,40405,2.0, Very nice man.  Retiring soon I believe.  Was wonderful delivering my baby.  
3522,40405,2.0," very nice, quick in and out. Paid/Co-pay:$15"
3523,40412,1.0," He is very patient,compassionate,and thorough.  He will not hesitate to send you to a specialist if he can not find the answer.  He is definitely in the field that  his calling. "
3524,40412,1.0, Dr Wade always has the time to explain his plan of treatment and answers any questions you may have. A very wonderful doctor! 
3525,40412,1.0, Dr. Wade is very attentive to his patients. He spends time with you and makes you feel that you are his only patient. He listens and tries to solve your problem as quickly and mannerly as possible.  
3526,40413,0.0, A doctor who pushes medicines on gay people.A very bad doctor and person. 
3527,40413,0.0, Amazing lady best doctor I have seen and the man before me did you happen to take first grade english&#63; It looks like you did not.  
3528,40413,0.0,.   
3529,40413,0.0," I was used as a lab rat when I was a teenager this woman shouldn't be a doctor she's not even a human being.I seen my medical records when I turned 18 years old, I couldn't believe the lies in those records,don't take your child to this person. "
3530,40420,1.0, Dr. Walker is a very respectful and good Doctor.  I have had problems with my back and he didn't stop until he found out what was wrong.  He is the best Doctor I have ever went to and I will contiue to see him as long as he is working.  
3531,40420,1.0," I am very pleased with Dr. Walker!  He is a wonderful person and Doctor.  He has been treating me and my children now since the pediatrician left there!  He cares, he listens, and he helps in everyway possible!  He goes above and beyond to make sure you are diagnosed and treated correctly!  He has been a blessing to my entire family!  I trust him with our lives!  I hope Dr. Walker stays with us for a long, long time!  He has made me realize that there is a Doctor here that CARES for us not just for our money!  Thank you Dr. Walker for being a WONDERFUL and PERFECT Doctor! "
3532,40420,1.0," This man is a very kind person, sweet and genuine, and is absolutely the best physician in our area.  He is very knowledgable in every aspect and is very very good at what he does.  He coming to our area is the best thing that has happened in a long time..  I hope he is around for many many more years! "
3533,40421,1.0, I was shocked at the profanity this guy uses in his talk which I consider unprofessional coming from a doctor. We switched doctors after two visits. Was very egotist and very rude. 
3534,40421,1.0," I've been to many psychiatrists in the area, trying to find one that actually cares about doing his job correctly. Dr Walker is the best by far! And as a bonus he's a likeable guy, too.  "
3535,40428,2.0,  
3536,40442,0.0," Dr. Wallace may be a nice woman, but she is not a very good doctor.  My mother tried to have her diagnose an illness for 3 months, calling and visiting at least 10 times.  Turned out it was lung cancer.  Dr. Wallace had not seen it on an x-ray months before that.  She didn't even do a follow up x-ray after my mother had pneumonia. "
3537,40442,0.0," she is the very best understandable person, doctor. help you in every way she can. she is really best doctor.  "
3538,40442,0.0," I find Dr. Wallace very personable and knowledgable.  She has helped me through several problems.  Her most important quality, to me, is that she listens, actally listens to what I have to say.  She respects a person's knowledge of their own body.  She does listen and if she thinks there is a better way to take care of something she goes that way.  She always calls me back, even in the middle of the night - even though she has children at home, she still cares for her patients.  In an emergency she makes time to see you.  My only complaint is that I often have to wait a long time to see her in her office (at times more then an hour).  But she is worth the wait.  She always takes time to listen to me and not treat me as just a number. "
3539,40442,0.0," I really liked Janet Wallace.  It seems like there is always a long wait..like a few hours.  I think staff could be alittle more prompt on scheduling test and giving response on blood work.  But again, Janet is very personable and easy to talk to.  "
3540,40442,0.0,".  I like Janet, but you have to wait a long time to see her, she spends a lot of time with her patients "
3541,40463,0.0," Dr. Walsh is an excellent, caring doctor. She takes the time to address your concerns and her entire staff is wonderful. I would refer her to anyone.  "
3542,40467,1.0," I have been going to Dr. Warren for over five years now and he is a very nice, respectful man. I recommend him highly. He will go out of his way to help you with whatever it is that is wrong with you. He is very knowledgeable in his field and will help you to the best of his abilities. The staff; very nice and polite.  "
3543,40468,2.0, excellent rapport w/ patients....has a very busy practice.  
3544,40470,2.0,Im a big chicken when it comes to dentists and they were great there...would recommend them to anyone...  
3545,40471,1.0,.  
3546,40471,1.0,"One of the worst doctors I have ever been to. He is always late, not friendly, can't remember his patients and doesn't seem to know as much as other doctors I have seen. I will not ever go to him again. "
3547,40471,1.0,I love Dr Bazley!! I was going to switch for insurance reasons but decided to switch insurance instead cause i feel so compfortable with Bazley as my dr 
3548,40471,1.0,"This man is one of the worst doctors I have ever met. Rude, no bedside manner and seems to lack any medical knowledge. And most of the time, he is behind schedule and rushed. Awful experience. "
3549,40471,1.0,"I had a HORRIBLE experience w/ this man. He didn't listen to my concerns, constantly demeaning on my weight among other uncomfortable aspects. He had no bedside manners and brought one of his kids with on a post c-section check in the hospital! I found out later that he let my bp get too high and that possibly (no way to know for sure) could have caused a birth defect in my child. also killed the majority of nerves in my lower abdomen during my c-section 4 years ago and most of them still have not returned back to normal. definately DO NOT recommend this &quot;doctor&quot;.  "
3550,40472,0.0,Not concerned about my high blood pressure even on medication. She has been treating me for years with medication. I seen another doctor and she gave me new medication and my blood pressure went down to normal for the first time in many years. 
3551,40473,0.0,Dr. Vicky Baker is always interested in her patients. She listens to patient questions and is willing to inform the patient and if she doesn't have the answer she finds it. She is willing to make needed referrals and responds kindly to patient requests. She is very easy to schedule an appointment with. Appointments can be made within a week or two. 
3552,40474,0.0,She is our pediatrician (6month old and 2 year old.  She is very good with children.  I love her &quot;down to earth&quot; approach.  Very thorough and personable.

3554,40476,1.0,"he is the best,helpful and caring,especially older people love him.  "
3555,40476,1.0,"Has a temper, uncooperative, does not keep medical records updated, cannot answer simple prescription questions. Yes, all of this is true. I have experienced this first hand. It is unimaginable.  "
3556,40477,1.0,"BY FAR THE BEST DR. THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN. HE TREATS HIS PATIENTS WITH SUCH CARE AND KINDNESS, WITH VAST KNOWLEDGE ON ANY SUBJECT. I WOULD RECOMEND HIM TO ANY FAMILY MEMBER OR FRIEND. TRUELLY A GENTLEMEN AND A SCHOLAR. "
3557,40477,1.0,Good doctor.Very helpful. Treated my high blood presure the best of all the doc's I have had 
3558,40478,2.0,Great Dentist. Treats you like a friend. Never any pain and straight forward on what is needed for you.  
3559,40479,0.0,Dr. Barwig needs to retire.  Please exercise caution if you choose to see her for your obgyn needs.  YOur family will have a nice tombstone for you. 
3560,40479,0.0,"Dr. Patricia Barwig is a very good doctor. She helped me deliver my daughter in 2007. She would generally be late for the pregnancy visits but you can count on her to be on time and take charge when the actual time for delivery comes or if any help is required. Thanks to her, I had a normal delivery and thanks to Dr. Jacky, I did not need epidural for the delivery. I am deeply indebted to you two and the Obgyn team in Brookfield, Wisconsin from the depth of my heart.  "
3561,40479,0.0,"Dr. Barwig is the best! I came to WI after Hurricane Katrina. I was pregnant at the time.  I was referred to her by the Red Cross a few days after I arrived.  She treated me with such compassion, patience and understanding.  My delivery was an excellent experience and she was wonderful.  I continue to see Dr. Barwig and early this year she delivered my nephew.  Dr. Barwig was a blessing and I will be forever grateful!  She is a wonderful physican that I would refer to anyone.   I look forward to my appointments with her because she is so kind! "
3562,40479,0.0,I have slways found Dr. Barwig to be concerned for her patients. She spend time with you until you have your questions answered and sometimes that means you have to wait a bit longer for her but she is this was with all her patients. She makes you feel like family.  Great Gal 
3563,40479,0.0,"I, too, cannot believe some of these people are talking about the same doctor. I have been seeing Dr. Barwig for nearly 25 years (hard to believe!!). I suffered two miscarriages, and the first one, especially, I will never forget how kindly she and her staff treated me. She went above and beyond. The second time, even the ultrasound tech cried with me. Dr. B saw me through very trying times, and my 3rd pregnancy was difficult, but she helped see me AND my husband through. She helped us both. And now, two healthy children later, I can't imagine seeing anyone else. I know not everyone may have same experience, unfortunately, but I've always highly recommended her, and her group.  "
3564,40479,0.0,I have been seeing Dr. Barwig for 20 years and thinks she is great. Always takes time to listen to any of my concerns and explains things fully.  Years ago my daughter had a problem that other doctors wouldn't deal with. Dr.Barwig was great. Can't believe these other people had the same doctor.  
3565,40479,0.0,"Dr. Barwig was a nightmare! When I was having a miscarriage at 6 weeks, she did not take time to fit me in her schedule as she didn't believe I was pregnant. Her nurses would not take me seriously on the phone when I said I was bleeding a super size tampon every 2 minutes. Finally, I demanded she see me. She fit me in later that day. When there, placenta finally came out. She blamed the whole thing on her nurses not telling her the whole story. I found her to be insensitive and not willing to go the extra mile.  "
3566,40479,0.0,"Dr. Barwig enjoys talkingin turn, keep patients waiting for her for quite a while. However, when you have a real medical concern to discuss, her response has been to me sarcastic, belittling and patronizing. With a high risk pregnancy, I came in to see Dr Barwig regarding a concern. She was more concern with talking about her staff not being told details about my visit when they didn't even ask. She in turn never asked me about my situation, instead she examined me, and said baby was fine and went on to something else. I told I needed to understand my situation better. Her response to me was &quot;Pregnancy isn't fun - look at your age (early 40's). I could not believe she could be so insensitive knowing my history of miscarriages - if anyone knows that pregnancy isn't fun it's someone with my history. I would never recommend a doctor who is inappropriate, unprofessional and doesn’t take the time to communicate and inform their patients as DR. Barwig has demonstrated.  "
3567,40480,1.0,Dr. Bahr was professional and patient during my annual physical. Regarding a couple of questions I had he was very proactive about what I needed to do next. Very recommended. 
3568,40480,1.0,Dr. Bahr was very patient and helpful.  He listened to my concerns and I never felt rushed.  I have recommended to other friends.  
3569,40480,1.0,Very helpful and easy to talk to. He was happy to spend time answering my questions. I never felt rushed. 
3570,40480,1.0,"This is one of those docs who don't listen and think they are the world because they have a diploma on their wall. He was poking fun of my problem and ignored helping me. I will never see him again as he is arrogant and did nothing to help me but say that i was 'fine,' when i wasn't! He talked me into doing something I didn't want to do and later my second doctor told me he shouldn't have done the test he did. I had to schedule another appointment with a different doctor to have a resulotion. "
3571,40481,1.0,Great dentist.  He really knows his stuff. 
3572,40482,2.0,Examined over a period of 15 mos. could not diagnose problem. 
3573,40483,1.0,"I went to Dr. Banks for many years, and while I always felt comfortable, and felt I got good service, I'm now finding out that he wasn't doing a very good job on my teeth.  I've had to have a LOT of work re-done that Dr. Banks did within the last couple of years.  I really like him, he's a great guy and very friendly but unfortunately, I think my issues were too advanced for his knowledge base.  "
3574,40483,1.0,Dr. Banks is extremely patient. I hate the dentist and he is very understanding about that and patient. His office staff is very friendly and remembers your name. He also has little word puzzles tacked to a cork board on the ceiling so you have something to do while they work in your mouth.  
3575,40484,1.0,If it wasn't for Dr. Barboi my mother wouldn't be alive today. His knowledge with gillianbauer syndrom saved her life. 
3576,40484,1.0,"Dr. Barboi has probably helped saved my life!  One of the best there is! His knowledge, care and desire to help is excellent! "
3577,40484,1.0,I can't say enough about Dr Barboi! Absolutely awesome!  Treats me like I matter!  He researches until he finds out what he needs to know.   Very caring and helpful!  One of a kind!  I recommend him!  He's not affraid to look beyond the text book!!!!!!! 
3578,40484,1.0,"This doctor really cares about helping his patients.  I have been to several different docs and he was the only one who has truly helped me.  He listens well, explains everything and actually takes notes during the examination!  He is very smart, but if he needs to seek help from his collegues....he will.  He doesn't have the high and mighty attitude most doctors have.  I like him and would recommend him to anyone needing a good neurologist.  "
3579,40484,1.0,"cant say enough about this doctor, he is the best! very caring, listens, knowledgeable, have reccommended him to several people.  "
3580,40485,1.0,"Dr. Babbitz is exceptionally knowledgeable, informative and considerate.  Plus his dry humor is a bonus! "
3581,40486,2.0, 
3582,40487,0.0,"She was condescending and smug.  She also told us things that were actually WRONG about our family member's diagnosis.  We did more research on our own and found information two different times that disputed what she had told us.  And not LITTLE mistakes--big things that she should have known.  She should either have referred us to an expert in the field, or she should have done more research herself.  We trusted her and made decisions based on what she told us.  Our family member died. "
3583,40488,2.0,Dr. Baltz was very kind and very professional.  
3584,40489,1.0,Awesome doc...very comforting and takes the time with patients...his staff in the kenosha office are wonderful!! 
3585,40489,1.0,"this is the best doctor in wi for cancer. when my husband was diganosed he sat down with us and explained everything. we went from fear to understanding. do not hesitate to call him. he is always current in the field of oncology and gives the one thing you need most, the truth.  "
3586,40489,1.0,"Dr. Bandealy is THE best oncology doctor in WI!!  He will talk WITH you, not at you and he makes sure you understand what's going on.  He listens to ALL your questions and takes lots of time to answer them.  That does make him off schedule alot but it's worth the wait.   The staff at the Kenosha office (in the Aurora hospital building) is the BEST!! "
3587,40490,1.0,"This doctor was awful to me. When he tells you that your symptoms are in your head and not really happening, that's not right. Never listens to what you are trying to tell him. I would never tell anyone to see him. "
3588,40490,1.0,"Other doctors said my condition was not serious but wanted a check up with Dr. Banasch, he panicked me into a procedure that put me in the ER twice for complications. The procedure did not find a problem. Very $$ and painful. Not happy. Wish I had checked out online before I went to him. "
3589,40490,1.0,"Dr.  Bannasch agreed with us that there was a problem and keep us coming back, and then told comp that there never was a problem.  He prescribed medicine and increased dosage over 3 appointments, but says there is no problem&#63;  We just don't know why this has happened.  "
3590,40491,2.0, 
3591,40492,1.0,Dr. Bavishi is a very good doctor. He genuinely cares about his patients. You can tell he isn't there just to get paid. I've Bern taking my daughter to him since she was born in Feb of 2011 and he has been so good with her and always asks about how our family is. He is such a good person. We moved 2 hrs away but still make the drive to see him for our daughter's check ups. 
3592,40492,1.0,Dr. Bavishi is the best pediatrican I have ever encountered.  He treats his patients like they are family.  The patient is always number 1.  His attention to detail allowed him to catch things other docs did not.  He also has excellent bed side manners. 
3593,40492,1.0,Dr. Bavishi is wonderful! He explains everything very clearly and is very thorough. He takes wonderful care of my 2 children. He remembers conversations and details about our family no matter how log it's been since we saw him. I can't imagine ever taking my children to another doctor. 
3594,40492,1.0,"He is wonderful, kind and knowledgeable. We can't imagine taking our daughter to anyone else. "
3595,40492,1.0,Very kind and caring. Dr. Bavishi has an excellent memory. He focuses not only on your child but on the family as a whole. I can't see myself ever changing doctors unless he moved away. 
3596,40493,2.0,"Very honest, won't yank your chain! Referred me to a specialist. "
3597,40494,1.0,"This doctor does not listen to parents concerns he does not return phones calls, he writes letters that are totally accurate.   The childrens needs are not being met "
3598,40494,1.0,"This doctor was horrible!  I would not take my dog to him for care.  Children's Hospital should be ashamed to have him on their staff.  Egotistical, Crude, Brash describe him to a &quot;T&quot;.  He view of his patients problems are that their parents have caused them. He will not work with the parent - but against them.  You can not have a working relationship with this doctor.  He wants parents to check their brain at the door and do whatever he want to with their child. "
3599,40494,1.0,"Very frustrating dealing with this doctor. He did not listen well. He disregarded information he was provided. He appeared often times to have made up his mind before he met with my daughter and myself. He would not veer from his intervention even when it was clear after months that it was not working. We changed doctors and it made an incredible difference. My advice is to avoid this man if your child is suffering from depression. Beyond that, I'd still be wary. He does not listen well. It could be a fatal mistake to take your child to him. "
3600,40495,1.0,"I have been a patient of Dr Bachhuber since I was 16 yrs old.  I am now 37.  He has treated my mother and father longer than that.  He is very knowledgeable and has excellent bedside manner. I would strongly recommend him, however, I don't know if he is accepting new patients or not. "
3601,40496,2.0,excellent. very personable and knowledgeable 
3602,40497,0.0,Very condescending. Talked to me like a child. Very uncomfortable with her arrogance and lack of empathy.  Switched doctors! 
3603,40497,0.0,"Dr. B is a gift in my life.  As others have noted, she goes beyond what I have ever experienced with any doctor, and with multiple illnesses, I have seen plenty.  i am a long-term patient(over 15 years approx), and I don't have a negative experience or feeling to share. She is an astute listener, has a well rounded knowledge and referral base and never ever has made me feel rushed.  In fact, she makes me feel like I am her only patient and comfortable enough to talk about anything.  My mom is 82 and she and her group of friends have been seeing her longer than I have, and every one of them expresses that she is special.  There is no put on here - she genuinely cares and that element in conjunction with her skills, literally saved my life.  I'm glad I trusted her with it.  God bless you Dr. B. "
3604,40497,0.0,"Amazing diagnostician! She quickly, and even over the phone, pinpoints what many doctors miss. She is patient oriented. "
3605,40497,0.0,"I echo the comments of the other raters. Dr Kaye makes you feel like you are the most important patient that she has. She is intelligent, articulate and knows her medicine. She and her team have gone above and beyond for me so many times that I have lost count. She exemplifies everything that is good in the medical profession. She maintains a strong network of fellow physicians so she can get you the care you need.  It is not &quot;practicing&quot; medicine with Dr Kaye.   She is the real thing! "
3606,40497,0.0,"Dr Kay is a caring concerned physician. She spends exactly the right amount of time with her patients. You can ask her anything & she will respond with knowledge & concern about you. She maintains an excellent relationship with other professionals that she may use as a referral. On numerous occasions she went above & beyond what I would expect of a Dr to make certain that I got the medication I needed quickly, and that I was seen by a specialist in a timely fashion.  I even believe she would make house calls if someone required that extra attention. She has the kindness of the old fashioned country dr mixed with a vast knowledge base.  "
3607,40497,0.0,"Dr. Baugrud's astute recognition of symptoms saved my life. She is thorough, up-to-date with medical research, and mixes in humor, warmth, and caring. Dr. Baugrud has referred me to other outstanding physicians--specialits in their fields. I can tell Dr. Baugrud anything and not feel judged or embarasses.  She is great! "
3608,40497,0.0,"Dr. Baugrud is a wonderful, very kind Dr. She takes time really listening to her patients so she can give them the best care she can. She is very knowledgeable and solves issues. My family has been seeing her for several years and she has served us very well. I would highly recommend Dr. Baugrud.  "
3609,40497,0.0,"Fantastic service, very knowledgeable.  Kind, patient and sensitive.  "
3610,40497,0.0, 
3611,40498,1.0,This doctor did interoral exam without washing hands and wearing gloves. Rushed and very unapproachable.  Did not like being asked questions.  Did not want to read scan of mass in neck because he felt it was said it was a secondary issue.   Never recommend this doctor to anyone 
3612,40498,1.0,". very rushed, didn't asess the situation and wouldn't own up to his mistake "
3613,40498,1.0,Dr. Barton did a great job on my nose. I can breath again and it looks perfect. He also was great in keeping me informed throughout the whole process. The Staff took good care of me and kept in touch with  me after my OP to see if I was ok. What more could you ask for&#63;!I felt I was in good hands throughout the whole time. 
3614,40498,1.0,"Didn't listen, cost me 184.00, and he wanted me to come back in 2 weeks. would have cost me again. Went to another Dr., he gave me some penicillin for the infection I had. "
3615,40498,1.0,"This Dr. seems to think he knows it all.  He takes very little time listening to his patients.  Verifying that he has very little patience.  I would not recommend him for service or get a second opinion, he seems to be into making money and not the patients welfare.  "
3616,40499,0.0,Dr. Bartow is always ready to answer any questions you have. She is a very smart lady who has always been there for me when I needed her. 
3617,40500,1.0,I went to see this doctor. Before driving 1.5 hours there the records of mine were told they would be reviewed. I was called by Kristen and told the doctor would perform the gamma knife of cyber knife a treatment I knew I was able to have done. This was the only one of two facilities in the area that did this treatment.  I confirmed this news once again prior to going there.  Once there .. the doctor wanted to take un necessary tests. Tests the doctors prior did not ever want or need. He did not care about my head pains and blurred vision at all. He seemed to change his story and want to instead run up my health insurance for him and the neuro surgeons visits instead. Stay away from this &quot;Quack&quot; He is the reason that people stay away from doctors and why alternative medicine and holistic approaches are on the rise. He called me today and when I was trying to calmly discuss this all .. he had a attitude with me and hung the phone up after telling me he took it upon himself to dismiss the case.

3619,40501,1.0,"You have to listen very carefully to Dr. Bar-Lev because of his Israeli accent, but if you do not understand he will repeat until you do fully understand.  He was friendly, warm and compassionate.  "
3620,40501,1.0,"Dr. Bar Lev truly cares about his patients. He doesn't sugar coat the facts, but the care he gives is in the top 1 percent I have received from any doctor.  When you are dealing with a life threatening disease you need and want someone who is straight forward with the facts. "
3621,40501,1.0,Would not go anywhere else.  Highest level of professionalism and expertise. 
3622,40501,1.0,"I actually like Dr. Bar-Lev a great deal.  I have seen him many times over the years due to an elevated factor 8, clotting dissorder enhanced with pregnancy. I accept that he doesn't have what appears to be the friendliest bedside manner on the outside, but he has always been knowledgeable, and has never steered me in the wrong direction while under his care.  He has always returned my calls and has answered my questions.  He is a straight shooter who does not &quot;poo-poo&quot; around issues.  There was one time, that our (lovely) insurance company would not cover the cost of my Lovenox injections hence having me pay out of pocket to the tune of $3200.00/month.  He and his staff suggested and allowed me to come in to their office to receive my injections saving us THOUSANDS of dollars.  If you can accept his personality for whom he is, and not take it personal- You will get some great care! "
3623,40501,1.0,"We called Dr. Bar Lev and told him I was in a porph attack, his nurse said for me to go the ER and he would meet me there. I took an ambulance there, was put in a room for him, he never showed up! The ER doctors kept calling him, he was in the hospital, but never came down, I laid there for 7 hours, freezing,unable to get to a phone for help-then I had to pay the ER bill, I wasn't on Medicare yet. Unbelievable, nightmare! Never received an apology or a phone call.  "
3624,40502,2.0,During my visit I felt that I was treated very well.I would absolutely recommend this doctor to my family and friends.  I felt this visit was a big help.Overall I would rate this visit : outstanding! 
3625,40503,2.0,"Extremely friendly staff, very knowledgeable and welcoming.  "
3626,40504,2.0,Fabulous surgeon with great office staff. Caring attitude with gifted hands.  
3627,40504,2.0,WONDERFUL DOCTOR AND COMPASSIONATE.  NO COMPLICATIONS POST SURGERY. HELD MY HAND ON THE WAY TO THE OR. 
3628,40505,2.0,"Wonderful doctor, highly recommend "
3629,40506,1.0,"Secretarial staff is RUDE.  Recently called to make an appt and the woman who answered the phone basically argued with me about the validity of the social security number on file and refused to make an appt even though she already had all of the remaining info in her computer.  This was a delicate matter that required someone with compassion to answer the phone, and it was as if I was calling for a dinner reservation.  If you miss an appt with them, they will refuse to see you again.  Unbelievable arrogance amongst most of the staff...I feel bad for the compassionate staff who have to work with the rest of them.  Dr Bauer is a nice man, however that is simply not sufficient enough when in need of medical advice.  If you don't do your research &amp; ask the right questions, don't bank on him digging deeper on your behalf.  "
3630,40506,1.0,"I have been going to Dr. Bauer for over 15 years.  What a wonderful man.  What Docter nowadays calls you in the evening with your test results - nobody!  Getting an appointment is relatively easy.  Now recently married in the past 3 years, my husband sees him on a regular basis.  He had been an uncontrolled diabetic and heart patient.  After a few months, Dr. Bauer had him in control of his diabetes, does regular heart testing and other procedures on him.  I have acid reflux disease and Dr. Bauer diagnosed it perfectly and sent me to a specialist who concurred.  As a family practice doctor, we have had our share of problems and have always gone to him.  Again his diagnosis has been spot on and we would recommend him to anyone.  His staff does appropriate follow ups and if critical situation is occurring, gets you in for an appointment asap.  He seems to know when to refer you to a specialist, what he can handle and what he feels would be better with another. "
3631,40506,1.0,"We have gone to Dr. Bauer for a long time,but are now looking for a new doctor. Almost seems like he is afraid to touch his patients,for example listening to heart . Seems to pass judgment on patients .Never asks how a person has been coping with long term conditions. When a person complains about ongoing problems does not suggest running other tests. Had a close friend who died from bone cancer because this doctor deceided he was just out of shape and didnot need anymore tests to find out source of his pain. He should realize it's not his job to judge people, but to try to cure them.  "
3632,40506,1.0,"Secretarial staff seems to think they can diagnose you themselves and decide whether or not you need to talk to the doctor.  I called Dr. Bauer with concerns about side effects I was experiencing from a new prescription he wrote and he said &quot;what do you want me to do about it&#63;&quot;.  Since he's the doctor, I thought he should know rather than myself, the patient.   I'm not a complainer or hypochondriac.  As a result of my growing lack of confidence in him and frustration with his staff, I've decided to seek treatment elsewhere.  I can't recommend him to anyone.  "
3633,40506,1.0,Staff at clinic is very rude. I suffer from depression and Dr. Bauer told me that if I attended his church and believed more I would no longer be depressed.  
3634,40506,1.0,Went to him years ago but still remember being treated rudely 
3635,40506,1.0,"Dr. Bauer and his staff have been treating me and my family for over 20 years and has always been very helpful. If a specialist is needed he will refer you to one, and his staff will make the appointment for you. He never makes you feel like he is rushed during office visits.  "
3636,40506,1.0,He has been my doctor since I was little and has always been very helpful and nice to me and my whole family. 
3637,40506,1.0,"I have been going to Dr. Bauer for 8 years. He has treated my family and me for various illnesses and conditions and we have never had a complaint about his service, knowledge, or capabilities. I would recommend him to anyone without hesitation.  "
3638,40506,1.0,"Dr. Bauer did not diagnose my father with cancer until my father came in to complain of the same pain for the 3rd time. My dad had a history of acid reflux, but Dr. Bauer did not inspect his esophogus on an anual basis as he should of. My father passed away because of this doctors negligence. Don't let this happen to your loved ones. STAY AWAY FROM HIM! "
3639,40507,1.0,Best doctor we have ever met.  He brings peace with all his knowledge and there is no existing match on earth for him.  We love him and thank him.  Lezama Family 
3640,40507,1.0,"What can you say about Dr. Becker&#63; This man is amazing!! He has such an incredible bedside manner. Nice in the office..a little on the late side most of the time in the office. But well worth the wait. He takes his time with his patients and actually LISTENS. His care goes well beyond the patient and extends to the family. Many many times when my husband was in the hospital, Dr Becker would come to check on him. His hugs and words of encouragement were priceless. If something was wrong in the hospital setting, one word to Dr Becker would rectify the problem. His wit is unmatched. His knowledge is endless. I recommend DR Becker to anyone who needs a heart Doctor.   ~Toni "

3646,40511,0.0,The time to see me was an issue but it was not her fault. Dr. Barnabie was great and did great with my surgery. She was an excellent listener and I was pleased with her. I would have her again. Highly recommended. 
3647,40511,0.0,"I have had two procedures performed by Dr Barnabei and feel she is a very skilled and caring Doctor. Although short and to the point at times she is very insightful and honest, this is greatly appreciated. I would and have recommended her to friends and family. "

Because of her inability or unwillingness to diagnose and treat post-op infection I ended up needing a second, even more invasive, surgery. Her conduct during my treatment and convalescence was completely inappropriate. I do not recommend her for women needing gyn surgery. "

3656,40516,0.0,"I am very appreciative of Dr. Bathke!  I, at the age of 18, was referred to Dr. Bathke by my primary physician.  Even though I was a young mother, her level of care was unparallelled.  Now,  at the age of 27 finding my own OBGYN in Charlotte, NC has proven to be hard.  She is a wonderful, informative doctor no matter what the circumstances and she will be an excellent  resource and companion throughout your pregnancy!  I can't say enough about her character!  Very professional and always willing to help :) "
3657,40516,0.0,"Dr. Bathke has been my OB/GYN since 2003, when my previous OB Dr. Kronman left the area.  She was wonderful for my fourth pregnancy and so supportive; in fact, we both had three children around the same age and were pregnant at the same time, although she had twins (numbers 4 and 5!).  So we related to each other very well and I can't say enough about how caring and helpful she is.  I look forward to my annual visits with her now and miss seeing her on regular basis (but, with four children, we are D-O-N-E).  To the reviewer who disagreed with Kris's choices as a woman/mother, I have to say that I also made different choices then she did for myself (I breastfed and had natural-drug free childbirths), but I found her as a Dr. to be completely supportive of my choices and totally non-judgmental.  I would (and have) recommended her as a dr. to my friends.  She's awesome!  :) "
3658,40516,0.0,"I cannot say enough how fantastic Dr. Bathke has been for me and my family. She is caring, knowledgeable, and even though she is obviously very busy, makes you feel like you are her only patient. She delivered both of my baby girls and if we go for a third I will be back again in a heartbeat. I have full confidence in her abilities as a physician, and greatly appreciate her calm bedside manner. "
3659,40516,0.0,"I had Dr Bathke for my first pregnancy and will be going to her again for my current pregnancy.  I had been referred to her as the clinic's 'fertility specialist' because I needed to have a laposcopy done.  She must have done a good job because a couple months later I was pregnant (after a year of trying!) and this time it only took 2 months.  I have been very happy with the care I have received from her.  Yes, she shared her experiences with her births with me, but I never felt pressured by her to do things the way she did.  She offered me information to help me make my own decisions.  The only complaint is that she can run late, but most Drs do.  It can be hard to get in for a last minute appointment, but I think that is because she has many patients.  I would definitely recommend her for a doctor. "
3660,40516,0.0,Dr. Bathke is one of the best doctors I have ever seen. My husband and I have both been very very happy with her throughout our pregnancy. 
3661,40516,0.0,Dr. Bathke was the best dr I have ever seen! I had a horrible 1st pregnancy w/ a different dr and saw Kris for my 2nd and she calmed all of my fears and had an incrediable 2nd pregnancy! she was VERY flexable from her appts to the c-section date and very open! I have already sent other people to her and will contine recommending her to everyone I meet! I lost my insurance that provides me to see her but I am thinking about skiping the new insured dr and just paying cash just so I can see Dr.  Bathke! 
3662,40516,0.0,"This is my 2nd birth and she was the on call dr that delivered for my first. She was soo great then that I decided to go with her this time around. She answers all my questions, and is VERY likable. I would recommend her to all my friends. Her and her staff are GREAT!....Speaking to the person that left a comment below, Dr. Bathke has twins, speaking as a Mom of twins, it's is VERY difficult to breast feed twins. And in case you were wondering this is a site for rating doctors not rating other parents! "
3663,40516,0.0,"So helpful, kind and understanding. Even when she knew I would be transferring to a different city and different hospital system she was always helpful and treated me with respect. I always felt comfortable asking her questions and she just went out of her way to be kind. "
3664,40516,0.0,"Bathke was my OB for both of my pregnancies. For the first, I knew very little and went mainly by her wishes - I ended up with a traumatic birth experience, that in part, is due to my ignorance and trusting nature. Second time around, I was a birth professional before I gave birth, and Bathke seemed dismissing and short with me. My birth was much better, as I did not end up birthing with her or her partners. Also - she has circumcised all of her sons, stating the reason of 'not wanting them to be made fun of' and did not breastfeed any of her children. She also induced all pregnancies for convenience. I find all of the above unethical, knowing the health implications as she should. "
3665,40516,0.0,"Bathke is a very flexible OB, and I've used her with the birth of both of my children. (Though I ended up getting a partner with my first, and had a planned homebirth with my second.) She completely respects my knowledge and choices, and has made an effort to change her routine practices to suit my 'hands-off' preference. I would love to have her attend my births, but I believe she is still held under hospital policy and insurance restrictions. I would highly recommend her to anyone. "
3666,40516,0.0,Best OB/GYN in Madison. Unbelievable bedside manner. Very compassionate and understanding. 
3667,40516,0.0,This doctor is very knowledgeable and very understanding and compassionate with women. Will listen to what you have to say and works with you. 
3668,40517,0.0,Had to wait over 30 minutes. Did resolve what I came there for.  
3669,40517,0.0,. she talks to you she takes her time and really cares 
3670,40518,2.0,I felt very comfortable and all my questions were answered.  Nice Dr.  
3671,40519,1.0,Dr. Beatse could have been responsible for the loss of my baby. He ignored all the red flags and all my complaints. It is only my own instincts that may have saved his life. PLEASE go elsewhere!! 
3672,40519,1.0,"I am not a fan, this is short version. I developed AFLP under his care. AFLP (Acute Fatty Liver of Pregnancy)is a rare condition,a rare life-threatening complication of pregnancy that occurs in the third trimester or the immediate period after delivery. I certainly do not fault him for my condition, I only fault him for not listening to me and potentially diagnosing me sooner than delivery, coma, liver transplant list. I expressed my discomfort throughout the end of 2nd, beginning of 3rd trimester. He repeatedly said to me &quot;It's third pregnancy syndrome&quot; a syndrome he created simply because our bodies are typically are more sensitive in 3rd pregnancy, maybe&#63; I feel due to his oversights and not listening (the sad thing is I would already feel awkward complaining, even when I would say something is wrong, it was dismissed. Even after the traumatic event (Dr Kate delivered me), almost 3 weeks in ICU, you think he would have called to check on me&#63; No. My baby &amp; I survived HIS oversight. "
3673,40519,1.0,He did surgery on me and the mesh already eroded after 3 years. I am not the only patient going through added procedures because of him and he continues to use the same mesh. He has NO right to be practicing at all. He needs to  stop... 
3674,40519,1.0,"From the very first visit (a referral from my primary care physician), Dr. Beatse and his nurse were very warm and understanding.  They made me feel as though I had been a patient for years!  Would highly recommend Dr. Beatse. "
3675,40519,1.0,"Not only is Dr. Beatse excellent but I love his nurse, Mary also. I also had to call the triage nurse once and she was very helpful and extremely patient. You always seem like the most important person that is there! I wouldn't have another baby without them! "
3676,40519,1.0,"Excellent doctor. He takes the time to listen to you and answer all questions. Very personable and caring. I've had many appointments with him because of infertility issues, and he never disappointed. Office staff is excellent as well. "
3677,40519,1.0,"I ask a lot. He either had the answer or found the answer. Care and compassion are top quality. I've been through many different kinds of MDs, so it takes a lot to impress me. I'm impressed. "
3678,40519,1.0,"Excellent OB, very direct, treated me great.  "
3679,40519,1.0,"Pretty good for an OB. Takes time, doesn't brush off questions, gets to know his patients. Doesn't treat you condescendingly. "
3680,40519,1.0,Very direct and to the point; took time to answer all questions; carefully considered my requests and needs. 
3681,40520,1.0,he was the best dr i have had for my back and hip.......  
3682,40520,1.0,excellent physician.  his treatment plan worked extremely well.  I would highly reccomend him to others.  
3683,40520,1.0,'back pain 
3684,40521,1.0,"Although Dr. Bailey does not do adjustments, his deep tissue massage procedures helped me with my back and neck pain when PT and yoga did not help.  The medical injections did little to help me. The visits were limited and he did not ask that I return time after time.  But if I had additional issues, I should call.  More than satisfied.  "
3685,40521,1.0,Dr Bailey is always very helpful and knowledgeable.  Explains what he is doing and teaches me.  Instead of a 5 minute adjustment he manipulates and then adjusts as needed.  
3686,40521,1.0,"I have gone to Dr. Bailey for about 3-4 years as needed.  He has been helpful at getting me in for 'emergency' visits and has always given me great results in pain releif and education of my muscle systems.  I have unique health concerns and he has been able to assist me in managing pain and flexibility.  He uses a variety of treatments, massage, ultrasound, and traditional manipulation.  He shows genuine conern for his patients. "
3687,40521,1.0,Why is this man listed as a chiropractor&#63;  He does not do any chiropractic adjustments.  He only does “muscle manipulation”.  What a waste of time and money.  I let him “manipulate” my muscles for several appointments and it solved nothing.  He refuses to do any standard chiropractic adjustments and spends most of your office visit explaining his unique views on the human body.  What a WASTE of time and money. 
3688,40522,1.0,i have good experience with dr bautista. i highly recommend him! 
3689,40522,1.0,"This has got to be the saddest, poorest most ridiculous excuse for a doctor I've ever seen in my life.  He can't speak plain english so when he gives you a incorrect diagnosis you don't know what the hell he's talking about anyway.  He is extremely short and doesn't listen to the patient but instead talks over you.  Where the heck did he get his license in the first place....kmart&#63; "
3690,40523,1.0,yes i had dr baskaya in 2007 he operated on me for anusium. was in the uw for 1mon..  and would see him frqeuntly at least once a yr for 5yrs. very caring person and polite very intelligent. if ever i would need a doc of his prfession   i would want him trust him very much never met a more nicer person hope he continues to practice for yrs to come  hope to meet him again some day but under different conditions . i try to mkeep in contact  but dont want to bother him .  and when i had surgery he explained what was going on with my family. what he was going to do. so i recovered so far no malfunctions. so im thinking he did great. 
3691,40523,1.0,was tom see dr baskaya on the 12th and he excused me from his care.if i ever go through this again i would request for dr baskaya to be my doctor he was excellent and very caring and polite   and also intelegent.  have hread a lot of aRTICLES ON HIM AND WHOMEVER HAS HIM FOR A DOCTOR HAS A VERY GOOD ONE.  phyllis

3694,40524,2.0,"Very thorough, and extremely knowledgeable. Excellent bedside manner. "
3695,40525,1.0,"Dr Balin is SUPERB. Harvard educated but extremely down to earth. Very knowledgeable. Beloved by staff and patients alike. Always got me in promptly when I needed it. I like him and respect him enormously. If I could somehow capture 10% of what he has, i would be golden! "
3696,40525,1.0,Dr Balin is the best doctor I have ever had. 
3697,40526,0.0,"What an amazing pediatrician!  We found her information on the Internet and, my, were the reviews right!  She was caring, knowledgeable, and on time.  My son has had some bad experiences with doctors and he warmed to her immediately!    She took the time to talk to me and took my concerns seriously.    We are so lucky to have found her:) "
3698,40526,0.0,"When looking for a pediatrician we set up a few interviews.  The office was very helpful and after we interviewed Dr. Bagnall we stopped looking.  She is very personable and yet professional.  She, or someone in the office, is always available to answer questions regardless of time of day.  We have always been able to get a same day appt. if our child is sick and we never have to wait long in the office.  Another thing I particularly like about Dr. Bagnall is that she does not push medication or practices on you.  She listens to your concerns and goes about giving your child the best possible treatment for whatever ails them.  Whether it be medication or suggesting something as simple as prune juice in their bottle.  We are expecting our 2nd child soon and are so thankful to have Dr. Bagnall around for our soon to be 2 children.  "
3699,40526,0.0,Dr.  Bagnall and everyone in the office are amazing! 
3700,40526,0.0,". She is great I would recommend her to any of my friends, and have! "
3701,40527,0.0,"This doctor was full of gloom and doom. She upset my family with her opinion of how my surgery was going to turn out. We first met her 10 mins. before my surgery. My surgery went very well, just as my REAL doctor's said it would. Find out who your anesthesiologist is going to be well before your surg. Check them out and stay away from this one. "
3702,40527,0.0,"Worst doctor I have ever had. Will report her, and am following up with a lawsuit. She forced my partner out of the room, and I specifically said he HAD to be there. She should NOT be practicing ANY type of practice.  "
3703,40527,0.0,"I thought she was pretty nice. I was scared and she assured me that everything was going to be alright. I met her for the first time in the holding room, right before they take you into the operating room. I asked her about her creditials and she was replied openly and honestly. She was not shocked by any of the questions I asked about her knowledge and experience. She asked me questions about my health and made me feel comfortable. I really can't complain about this doctor at all. "
3704,40528,1.0,". Very informative, gentle always has his patients best interest in mind "
3705,40528,1.0,"repaired my child's acl injury. quiet confidence, calm, well-informed.  best rated in Milwaukee magazine.  Doesn't push surgery.  not hustling and schmoozing for patients.  great result.  explains procedures well.  would use again. "
3706,40528,1.0,"Best kept secret in Milwaukee area.  Doesn,t have to schmooze to get patients.  They find him.  This is who all the docs' families go to.  Offers options besides surgery, not hard sell.  Has a plan, so you as patient can just relax and get better. "
3707,40528,1.0,"Never hurried; extremely gentle, patient and thorough; explains well. Always seems to know about newest procedures and techniques, and will explain why he will or will not use them. If for a chronic condition there is little or nothing that can be done surgically or medically, he will say so, and suggest exercises to strengthen the area. "
3708,40529,0.0,The best neuro surgeon I have ever met in 35 years.  
3709,40529,0.0,Flawless!  I was in a snowmobile accident and she spent 17 straight hours personally removing bone fragments from my back.  In follow up she explained everything more than once when the medication prevented me from retaining the details.  She is definitely a type A neurosurgeon! And I wouldn't have it any other way. 
3710,40529,0.0,"After a snowmobile accident, I was life-flighted to Froedtert Hospital where Dr. Baisden did a craniotomy due to a subdural hematoma and brain shift.  She saved my life.....what more can I say.  She is a gifted, talented surgeon and I thank God she was on call the night of my accident.  Thank you many times over.  I only saw her again one time in follow up to the surgery.  She was very  pleasant, answered all of my questions and was genuinely pleased with my progress and (I believe) her expertise.  Again, had it not been for Dr. Baisden's expertise, I would not be alive today.  "
3711,40529,0.0,"What more could you ask for - Dr. Baisden is a great surgeon, plus she spends tons of time with you.  She is extremely down to earth.  I'm extremely happy with the results I've had from my surgery. "
3712,40530,1.0,"I have been visiting Dr. Behlmer for six years -- nearly 12 visits in all. NEVER again. He has not done anything to help with sensitivity I've complained of for all that time. It's always an excuse like &quot;maybe the hygienist cleaned too hard&quot; or some such thing. So, I've decided to find another dentist before I waste any more of my time and my insurance company's money. I called for records for a new dentist. All they gave me was a statement. Then, I asked for a duplicate of x-rays. They were supposed to have them ready for me by noon on Tuesday. I showed up at noon and there was a sign on the door that they were out of the office until 12:15 pm. So, I returned at 12:15 pm and they had nothing ready for me. I hope this is the last time I ever have to set foot in their office. Their customer service is deplorable at best. There was a woman in the lobby filling out &quot;new patient&quot; paperwork--all I wanted to do was yell &quot;run away and go elsewhere if you truly value your dental health&quot;.  "
3713,40530,1.0,"Went to Dr. B for years.  Kept having fillings and crowns fall out, usually shortly after being placed in.  One time it happened, went to another dentist who said it was because there was underlying decay in the new crown which hadn't been drilled out before placement.  I'd had full mouth x-rays done two months prior and Dr. B said there were no problems; this dentist discovered 12 cavities (and showed me them on the x-rays), many underneath fillings done by Dr. B over the past couple of years, including one that was advanced enough where tooth had to be pulled.  Dr. B is nice and personable, as is his staff, but he needs to get his eyes checked. "
3714,40531,0.0,She is an extremely nice doctor.  She cares A LOT about her patients and she will do everything that she can to help you.  I do not know what I would do without her.  She always makes time for her patients.  She really goes out of her way to help you and will never give up on you. 
3715,40532,2.0,Urgent care Doctor. Useless. Didn't bother to read chart nurse filled out prior. Answered most questions with &quot;I don't know&quot; suggested over the counter Meds. Later visit to real Dr. turned out to be severe ear infection.  
3716,40533,0.0,"Dont call for refills on Fridays, Don't call for refills until you count the pills you have left. Told me I am on too much meds and then wrote a script for another. Have actually been in an argument that left me in tears and slamming doors on my way out. Receptionist has reprimanded me. Worth every cent 0. 00 "
3717,40533,0.0,A very uncaring person. She's not interested in your problems.

3720,40536,1.0,"Excellent service, patient and professional. "

3724,40539,1.0,"In 1990, I saw Dr. Battaglia as a troubled teenager. He was immensely helpful. I credit him with gently bringing me out of a long childhood depression and inspiring me to go into the helping professions myself.  "
3725,40539,1.0,distracted doctor confused patients history.  not enjoyed by his staff 
3726,40539,1.0,"Battaglia does not hear patients. Listens, but doesn't understand them.  "
3727,40539,1.0,Prescribes for illnesses he holds little experience with.  His &quot;expertise&quot; could be his major fault.  
3728,40539,1.0,". I feel the doctor only heard half of what I told him, and added too much &quot;clinical&quot; knowledge to comments made by patient "
3729,40539,1.0,Dr. Battaglia is an expert resource for Mendota Mental Health out-patients to ensure their medications and services provided for those clients is followed through with great experience and knowledge by his team of nurses and support staff.  This is a very dedicated of team of people that includes the PT's families and the dedication to their work not seen anywhere else in Dane County.  
3730,40540,1.0,"Dr. Bechard is very friendly and listens.  We were very happy with the care he gave to our young son who needed tonsils and adenoids out, and ear tubes placed. "
3731,40541,0.0,"He came very highly rated, but the good doctor seems like he has a few screws loose. His exam was rather cursory, even though I told him I have had basal cells remove before. He seemed more interested in commenting on how &quot;lovely&quot; my skin was than anything else. I asked him if he was flirting with me, and he replied, &quot;Maybe a little.&quot; He correctly diagnosed a spot on my shoulder I was worried about as just surface blood vessels, but said I had no need of annual skin exams, which I have always been told every one at risk for skin cancer should have, especially someone who has had it before.  Then he went way off topic, and started pushing a vitamin supplement agenda, which, when I checked after I got home, recommended dangerous levels, in some cases. I will not be returning to him. My internist said she will recommend someone else next year. "
3732,40541,0.0,"Great staff, is always running behind though as I think he likes to talk quite a bit.  Very knowledgeable and friendly. "
3733,40542,0.0,"Very complete in her questions, takes her time.  Has a wide range of knowledge. "
3734,40543,1.0,Can't say enough great things about Dr. Baek and his staff. He fixed 4 disks in my neck in 2 surgeries. He's very thorough and ALWAYS on time for his appointments. He listens to all of your concerns and answers all of your questions. His staff makes you feel comfortable as soon as you walk in the door. All phone calls are returned promptly.  
3735,40543,1.0,Dr. Baek was able to repair my L5 back problem quickly in an outpatient procedure.  I am very satisfied with the outcome. 
3736,40544,1.0,"Absolute worst visit to a doctor I have ever had.  Did not have any real knowledge of the issue I came to him for and he left the room so abruptly that I didn't even know the appointment was over!  I waited for 15 minutes till the nurse came in to tell me I could go.  There was no resolution, he didn't give me any tips or things to try at home.  I would never see this doctor again and am actually considering changing clinics all together.  Disappointing.  "
3737,40544,1.0, 
3738,40545,1.0,"I had to deal with this guy b/c he was the company doc.  I hurt my shoulder at work and had to see him.  If I would have been paying for it and not work comp, I would have stopped seeing him after the 2nd visit.  I saw him 5 or 6 times over a 6 month time frame.  His diagnoses changed 3 times as to what was wrong with my shoulder.  On the last visit, he said he was going to refer me to an orthopedic surgeon, finally. But, he said he wanted to do a cortisone injection. He said that it would be what the surgeon would do, so instead he would do it.  Needless to say, he stuck the needle into the bone so deep that it covered the opening. So when he pressed down on the plunger nothing was coming out. So he pushed harder, still nothing, so he pushed harder and the needle and plunger exploded. The two separated and sprayed cortisone on both of us. Other guys at work have had problems too, not quite this bad though.  "
3739,40546,1.0,Absolutely love him! He is so kind and caring... and an excellent surgeon. I highly recommend him.  
3740,40546,1.0,"Dr. Bartos is a fantastic doctor and surgeon. He's willing to listen to you, he's very dedicated, and he explains things completely - making sure that you understand what's being said. He has treated me for two issues (one of which required a laparoscopic surgery); he's also seen my sister and my father...and everyone loved him! I would highly recommend him to anyone.  "
3741,40547,1.0,He is a goodsend. He is so attentive and answers all my questions. He immediately sends my to specialists that I need and will forward me to PT whenever I ask. A dream to work with. 
3742,40548,1.0,"Horrible Office. They scheduled an appointment at 10:30 with me, had changed it to 10:15 without my knowledge, and when I arrived AFTER being checked in, they called me back and criticied me infront of the entire waiting room for being past 15 minutes late. (Which was false). I explained I've been waiting to see him for a long time and have been in the ER over 12 times the last 2 weeks and the nurse, Dr. Bains, and the receptionist still refused to serve me. I will never recommend this poor quality for unprofessional staff or his services. They do not care about their patients health. This is a &quot;all-for-the-money&quot; office. Not an understanding one. "
3743,40548,1.0,Manmeet Bains is an excellent Dr.  She doesn't just touch base and leave.  She thoroughly tries to understand the patients issue/problem; and finds the appropriate tests and treatments for the patient. 
3744,40549,1.0,I thought Dr. Becker and his staff were absolutely wonderful! I visited the Franklin location and all were extremely friendly and Dr. Becker was very helpful and patient. Never made me feel like he was waiting to leave as many Dr's do sometimes! I would highly recommend this Dr.! 
3745,40550,2.0,"Very helpful, super nice and answered all my questions, friendly staff, no wait, nicest doctor I've ever been to "
3746,40551,1.0,"I was a patient of his for MANY years.  My last visit was truly odd and very disturbing.  I have adult acne and I was told there was nothing else he could do for me.  I said there must be something else we could try, and he said, &quot;well there is a gun shop down the street&quot;.  I was so stunned I just stayed for the rest of my appointment, went home, but called the next day and told his staff what had transpired.  They were very apologetic, but I never went back there again.  I am now seeing another doctor who did find a way to help me.  Be aware, education is not the only thing that matters.  Ask around first.  "
3747,40551,1.0,"Dr.Barsky left me sitting in a chair for nine hours while my hair transplant procedure was being done by a technician, ( it was the first time the tech had performed the procedure). At my initial consultation I had informed Dr.Barsky that I had Multiple Sclerosis. But, he did not care about letting me sit there for a nine hour operation! I felt sorry for the tech ... all by himself ... trying to do his best. He kept appologizing to me. All the while Dr. Barsky was in an adjacent room performing surgeries on others. I was told at my initial consultation that my surgery would take four hours. After my nine hour surgery I went home and vomited repeatedly for next 36 hours. I called the doctor to ask why I was so sick and was told that I had had a fair amount of Lidocaine and that can make you vomit. I would not have had so much Lidocaine if my surgery had not gone on so long ... requiring repeat doses of Lidocaine! "
3748,40551,1.0,"Neck & face lift left me heavily scarred on face & chin, numb, permanent facial neuralgia, bags under chin & on cheek bones, high cheeks lowered off of cheekbones. My concerns were met by Dr. Barsky with defensiveness and not taken seriously.  "
3749,40551,1.0,"I saw doctor Barsky every week, 3 days a week for 6 months. On every visit he was personable, caring and worked very hard to improve the quality of my health. Very dedicated. "
3750,40551,1.0,"I've been a patient for Dr. Barsky's for 10 yrs & have always been happy with my care. Recently, I've needed to address issues with spider veins on my legs & hyperpigmentation on my face. I'd never trust anyone other than Dr. Barsky to work on me. He & his staff were very patient, caring, & kind with these slightly uncomfortable procedures. I'm very happy with the results & even more with how I was treated. I highly recommend Dr. Barsky. "
3751,40551,1.0,HAD TO HAVE A REAL PLASTIC SURGEON REDO SKIN CANCER SURGERY TO SALVAGE MY EAR.  
3752,40551,1.0,Small procedure but same reasonable care.  
3753,40552,0.0,Totally clueless and disrespectful.  Lied about my condition and treatment options available to me.  Actually she never made me a part of the treatment decision process.  
3754,40553,0.0,"Very Flip - did not take any time to review records before appointment.  Almost dangerous in her lack of detail. She was very fast - like she had been doing for so many years, that the details of a specific case were not important.  "
3755,40554,1.0,"This Dr. kept telling me to come in if I had painl  The pain was approx. a 8 on the scale so I followed his advice.  The last time I was in there he said it was healed and I should not have an pain and to go to my dentist.  When I called my Dentist, he was on vacation and when I asked to see someone else, I was told to go back to Dr. Bascik and when I did Dr Bascik had someone call my dentist and then I was told by his assistant that he would give me pain pills, but this was the last time.  I told the assistant that I felt like he was lying about the pain and he was accusing me of being an addict.  This is totally false.  He needs to learn a better bed side manner. "
3756,40555,1.0,"I could write a book about this man. I can't believe how many people gave him such great reviews. I saw him for years before becoming pregnant, went through surgery with him, and saw him for two pregnancies. Before I got pregnant I loved him. Then when I started going more often I came to find he was very inconsistent. He would say one thing at an appointment and another thing the next time. He got impatient during my daughters delivery so he used a forceps to get her out. He wanted to induce me at 39 weeks because he was going on vacation and when I ended up going into labor on my own, he completely missed my sons delivery because he got impatient again, only this time he LEFT while I was pushing claiming I was nowhere near delivery.  My son was born minutes later.  The nurse almost delivered him because the floor doctor was busy assisting with a c-section at the time. I've also seen him be incredibly rude to his nurses. I have since found a new doctor and am much happier.  "
3757,40555,1.0,"We had a horrible experience with him where he first tried to blame a nurse for his mistake, and then when that was found out he blamed another doctor.  My cousin's neighbor is a Labor nurse at West Allis and she says that the doctors who go to high-risk deliveries only go to a few deliveries every day but they always go to all of his.  "
3758,40555,1.0,"At 42, we were pregnant with our 3rd child, and I found out my OB of 20 yrs. had suddently retired. Dr. Bear was rec. by a friend, and it was a blessing in diguise. After a very high risk preg. &amp; pre-term labor since 13 weeks, Dr. Bear called me at home to check in often. He explained why things were happening &amp; reassured me when things were scary. I made it to my due-date when baby wasn't moving much. Dr. Bear came in on his day off, broke my water, and came back to the hospital shortly after. He stayed the whole time. While delivering, my baby got stuck and her heart stopped. Dr. Bear had to use both hands to pull her out. He resuscitated her, and we have our beautiful daughter today. She just celebrated her 1st b-day, and I know without Dr. Bear, she wouldn't be here with us today. He's also been amazing with post-preg hormone issues &amp; post-partum depression. He's worth a waiting room wait.  "
3759,40555,1.0,"I loved Dr. Bear, He made me feel so comfortable to have a c-section when we found out my son was breech. He was lovely to my fiance and I was so happy that he delivered my son. His bedside manner is AMAZING!!! I recommend him to all my friends and family if they ever get pregnant. My mother recommended me to him, since he delivered all 3 of her kids besides myself. I know I will go back if I have another child. THANKS DR. BEAR!!!! "
3760,40555,1.0,"Dr. Bear happened to be the dr. on call the night my daughter was born. He was so wonderful in the delivery room - patient, kind, kept the mood light, really seemed to care even though I had never met him before that night.  After our daughter was born, my husband and I decided that I should switch OBs and go to him fulltime. I am so glad I made that decision. I've also recommended him to other people I know, and they, too, have had nothing but wonderful things to say about him.  "
3761,40555,1.0,Dr Bear is a wonderful Doctor to have.  I have never felt so comfortable with any other Doctor.  He does his best to make you feel as comfortable as possible.  His positive attitude is very uplifting in times of need.  I would recommend him to anyone.  You will not be disappointed.  
3762,40555,1.0,It is not a competent physician at all.  Would not go back or recommend him to anybody. 
3763,40555,1.0,"Dr. Bear is a wonderful doctor i have seen him since August he is there for his patients, he is very helpful. "
3764,40555,1.0,"Dr. Bear is the best doctor I have ever went to, hands down, for anything.  He did my tubal ligation for me when no one else wouldn't and made me feel entirely comfortable with the whole surgical procedure.   I will definitely be seeing him until he retires! "
3765,40555,1.0,"I have been a patient of Dr. Bear's for a couple of years now. When my husband and I decided we wanted to start trying for a baby I went off of birth control and began experiencing terrible lower abdominal pain. I had every procedure under the sun and no one could figure out what was wrong with me. My GI doctor even suggested that the pain was &quot;all in my head.&quot; Dr. Bear got me in for laparoscopic surgery within a matter of days and found I had endometriosis and ovarian cysts. Ever since he “cleaned me out&quot; I have been feeling so much better. As a result of my endo my husband and I have been having a hard time conceiving. Dr. Bear has been a wonderful resource and has referred us to a great specialist. As others have said, Dr. Bear makes you feel as though he really does care and he will not hesitate to call you at night and on the weekends to check in.  He is by far the best doctor I have ever had and I can only hope that he will deliver one of my babies in the very near future! "
3766,40555,1.0,"Dr. Bear is the most caring, compassionate doctor I've ever seen.  After going to a female doctor for infertility issues I switched to Dr. Bear.  He constantly calls to check up on me, even calling sometimes on a Sunday afternoon.  You never feel rushed during your visits and he has the best bedside manner I've ever had with any physician. "
3767,40555,1.0,"Dr. Bear delivered all 4 of my children and helped me through 2 miscarriages and postpartum depression. He is very kind, caring, understanding, intelligent, and considerate. He helped us connect with a surgeon for our youngest dayghter who had a cleft lip. (he telephoned and got us right in!) I travel a distance to see Dr. Bear. He is worth the trip. Also, before I had any children and I was uncomfortable with the exam, it was Dr. Bear who suggested that my husband attend appointments with me. My husband said Dr. Bear is very professional and never made him feel awkward. Eventually, I didn't need my husband there with me. And, once I started having children the relationship between Dr. Bear and my husband had already been formed, so the delivery room was a super experience! Dr. Bear has laughed with me. He has also cried with me. And, more than that... he has cared about me and my babies! "
3768,40555,1.0,I had gone to Dr Bear for a 2nd opinion when I had overian cancer he was wonderful and did all things nessesary to correct the problume.  Unfortunatly I am now married and my husband did not feel comfortable with Dr Bear I wish I could go back to Dr Bear he is wonderful but I dont want to deal with my husband beind insecure 
3769,40555,1.0,"Makes you feel cared about, cared for, important and special. Can't say enough good things about him.  I would drive 200  miles if I had to to have him remain my doc.  And ladies, if you are premenopausal or post menopausal he's all about your comfort, health and emotional well-being. I cannot imagine why women prefer seeing women doctors...no female doc would ever be this wonderful to you.  "
3770,40555,1.0,"dr. bear is a wonderful person. he delivered my son, as well as other stuff for my health. i would truly recommend this doctor to anyone who asked. very personable, knoweledgeable, and if he didn't know, would go out of his way to find the answer.. no matter how small.  "
3771,40555,1.0,"Dr. Bear has been my OB/GYN for 6 of my 7 children, including a very high-risk pregnancy, and he has been great with each!  Very caring and skilled.  Would recommend him very highly. "
3772,40555,1.0,Dr. Bear has an awesome bedside manner. He consistently spends enough time during my visits to listen and address any/all of my concerns. I have gone to him for 2 pregnancies and he delivered both of my children. I'd very very highly recommend him!!! 
3773,40556,2.0,"Dr. Bartell is amazing. Really, just an awesome person, and an awesome person to talk to with a lot of perspective. "
3774,40557,0.0,"Dr. Bedi is an excellent DR.  I had an unusual condition and I went to see her and with her figuring out my condition, I am living a much better life.  She now sees my baby girl too.  She seems to really care about her job.  "
3775,40557,0.0,"I recently had a health scare. I was upset about it. See gave me a prescription for an antidepressant and told me it had no side effects. First off I have not ever been diagnosed as clinically depressed, and she is not a psychiatrist, her only evaluation was based on my emotional state at the time. Which is ridiculous. Secondly, antidepressants would not have helped the true cause of the problem I was having, it may have made things worse and got me hooked on a scary drug. Thirdly, there are horrible side effects reported with the drug she gave me.    So using my better judgment I threw the  prescription away. I saw another doctor, who listened to me. I now feel better. I am never going to see Dr. Bedi again. This proved to me that she has poor judgment and/or was trying to make money from the pharmaceutical companies. Putting my well being at risk. It’s unfortunate that we can’t trust our own doctors. "
3776,40557,0.0,"Dr.Bedi was very helpful.  My daughter saw her for a 2nd opinion.  She did refer her to another endocrinologist but she acknowledged my daughter's symptoms along with her previous tests results, something her 1st dr. has failed to do. She was prompt, polite and listened actively and gave us more options than the 1st doctor. "
3777,40557,0.0,"poor bedside manner, insensitive, uncaring, rushing, hard to understand. "
3778,40558,1.0,"Have been seeing Dr. Beatty for over 2 years now, he is one of few doctors that I would trust.  Any questions that we have had, he has answered and will give you an honest answer every time.  He will not **** foot around the subject or question.  He has called and spoken to us after hours w/o any problems and he has been more than happy to speak w/us.  His check ups are complete and if there are any concerns he will address them. "
3779,40558,1.0,I've seen him for several appointments. Dr. Beatty is often rushed and acts confused at appointments. He is not up on the latest in medical research. His bedside manner leaves much to be desired. Does not like to answer questions. Kinda moody. 
3780,40559,0.0,She is great - she is currently doing some administrative things so is less available but is wonderful when you can get in to see her. 
3781,40559,0.0,I thought she was the best doctor I had ever used until she missed some very important things that didn't get diagnosed until she was on maternity leave and I had to see someone else. For general family med I would still recommend her. 
3782,40560,1.0,"I felt his office was unsanitary, wondered if he even sterilized his nail cutter before using it on me. I found he &quot;talked the talk&quot; but didn't &quot;walk the walk&quot;.  He completely forgot why he saw me the first time and insisted my shoes were the wrong size (i am an ADULT) I can tell if my shoes fit. No one measures a shoe sitting in a chair! He told me about a women who had lost alot of weight and what a great figure she had, which I found sexist and unappropriate.  I find it annoying that he doesn't even close the exam room door for privacy. I figured he likes to hear himself talk so much, he considers the waiting room patients his audience.  No thanks = stay clear of this freak.  Will never go back!! Seems like a guy to make a fast insurance buck and that's it, besides like to hear himself talk.  "
3783,40560,1.0,"My experience with Dr. Balkanski was quite amazing. I work on my feet all day and he addressed my issue very thorough!! I followed his instructions to the T and I was back to work in full swing. I highly recommend this physician for any type of podiatry ailment. Alan is personable and has a great sense of humor,but he can be curt at times. Overall he marks 4 out of 5.  "
3784,40560,1.0,"I would not recommend this dr.  Didn't spend more than 15 minutes with me, most of which he told me how bad my previous doctors were. He didn't listen to what I was saying about my foot, just kept interrupting with how I was misdiagnosed in the past and how mad that made him. He also records information about the patient he just got done with on a recorder, by the waiting room, so everyone waiting gets to hear confidential information about other patients.  Not professional. "
3785,40560,1.0,This doctor is by far the worst doctor I have ever seen for my foot and ankle pain. He gave me a diatribe of the previous doctors I had seen for my foot problems saying they should be ashamed of the advice and medical opinions they had given to me. He As well said he wouldn't give me a cortisone shot for the state doesn't pay him enough to treat Title 19 patient. Please for your own good don't go this man masquerading as a health care professional. 
3786,40561,2.0,I did not have a good visit with this doctor. To the point of not trusting. This is very sad because I used to hold high reguard for doctors.I think trust was thrown out the window for me. 
3787,40562,0.0,Dr. Bade is an amazing doctor. She is patient and very bright. She spends time and asks questions to understand symptoms. I am sorry is leaving Milwaukee.  
3788,40563,2.0,"Very knowledgeable and kind, listened to my concerns and took care of things right away "
3789,40564,0.0,"I sought counseling at Melinda's clinic when I was a teen. I felt sad after our exchange student left. She would only see me with my parents and with her husband Jack as cotherapist in family counseling. In eight months, we never got back to my sad feelings, which resolved on their own. Instead, they either sat silent or took turns insulting my parents. My parents weren't professionals, but they were intelligent and knowledge working people who deserved better. We were too respectful of professional people to fight back against this kind of abuse, and we just kept going back because they told us to. After eight months of this--and after they tried to convince us we needed 5 YEARS of family counseling, we saw the light and left. We had been reluctant to see both of them due to cost, but they reassured us that insurance would cover it if they billed for all 3 of us. The insurance flagged this as excessive and refused to pay. So the money had to come out of my college fund. "
3790,40565,0.0,Very thorough and caring.  Helped me with two female issues and performed surgery.  Excellent results.  I have a lot of confidence in her abilities.  
3791,40565,0.0,Very caring and knowledgeable doctor. Hard to get into though. 
3792,40567,1.0,Great Anesthesia doctor! He is friendly and will take good care of you while you are asleep. 
3793,40567,1.0,. Very Good Anesthesia Doctor 
3794,40568,2.0, 
3795,40569,1.0,See also comment his wife Melinda. He seemed unable to be assertive without his wife present. They strung us along for months under false pretenses. Never little benefit despite months of work together. 
3796,40571,2.0,Brian is amazing. Great professional. Excellent repair on my 2 front teeth after I seriously damaged them in fall. 
3797,40572,1.0,"The 1st time I saw him he blew all of my symptoms off all because he said I was to young to have related problems. Then he asked me what I thought was wrong&#63; Well if I knew the answer to that why would I be in the ER!&#63;!&#63; So he ran some tests just to pacify me and told me he didn't find anything so I must be fine. I ended up back the next night and then the attitude came out. &quot;I told you yesterday that nothing was wrong, I ruled out the bad stuff so why are you back&#63;&quot; Really&#63;&#63; I finally told him I was going home and would go to a different Dr so he leaves. 2 mins later he comes back and says I would feel better if we ran 1 more blood test before you leave, it'll only take half an hr. So we waited another hr and a half before he came back in w/ his attitude and sent me home still having no idea what was or is wrong! What a unprofessional jerk! "
3798,40572,1.0,"Took my wife into the ER because she had classic heart attack symptoms. Was disinterested and brushed it off. Left Sided chest pain, radiating to the back, shoulder, and left arm all the way down to the fingers. Self medicated with a spray of nitro before visit and it took all the pain away. Went back, and he was less interested, and brushed off any sort of cardiac issue due to HER AGE. And then when I got upset with him he got up on his high doctor pedestal and went on a rant. Wouldn't do anything to put our minds at ease, wouldn't listen to anything either my wife or I said (we are both in EMS and pre hospital patient care, and my wife has worked in several ER's) Dr. Foster is VERY unKnowledgeable, very poor bedside manor, very poor patient skills and exceptionally poor listening skills.  Will tell you he is right or he flat out doesn't know, and that you need to see another doctor. Not helpful at all at aleviating any sort of worry. "
3799,40572,1.0,"Poor bed-side manner. Seemed disinterested and hurried, as though I was not worth his time. According to him the only treatment options I had were to have a C/T scan or go home and if I didn't feel better to follow up with another doctor. &#63;&#63; He only looked into one symptom and when asked about other symptoms simply said &quot;we didn't test for that.&quot; At one point he actually asked me what I thought was wrong. Well, if I knew that I wouldn't have gone to Urgent Care would I&#63; Overall, he was disinterested, un-knowledgeable, and I wouldn't say rude, but certainly not caring. "
3800,40573,1.0,The absolute worst dentist I have ever seen in my entire life.  He put my five year old son through agony and then refused to treat him that evening when the pain was unbearable.  I had to take him to emergency room.  Turns out he cut into a nerve in my sons mouth.  An absolute nightmare and I think he is crooked ...Stay away from this guy.  I do not even think he is a legitimate dentist. 
3801,40573,1.0,Our two sons went to him. Both had excellent care. Staff very friendly and helpful. Dr. Ferraro always answered any questions; and he even called me personally to discuss suggested care with another specialist.  
3802,40573,1.0,This dentist insists that he can do every dental service. He professes to be knowledgeable in all dental areas. He does not admit when he is not able to do an appropriate job. He does not refer to other specialist when he should. 
3803,40574,1.0,"I have been seeing Jeff for 4 years. He is a fabulous Psychologist. Nonjudgmental, insightful, kind, and caring. He is the fourth psychologist I saw and I intend that he will be the last.  "
3804,40575,0.0,Was awful. After going to see a real chiropractor I was so mortified that I had wasted my time with Dr. F in Kenosha.  Her tools and &quot;Therapy&quot; remind me of kids toys and had no affect on my Pain.  
3805,40576,0.0,"Dr. Fenske has been my doctor for 15+ years.  She has always been attentive and up to date with my extremely complicated medical history.  She saw me through fibroid complications which interfered with me becoming pregnant.  Thanks to her I have two beautiful and healthy children.  To the not so satifised patient (06/2010), Dr. Fenske was battling cancer throughout 2010 so I highly doubt that she was actually taking vacations during your pregnancy.  It is because of her medical battles that she has since retired.  The OB/GYN practice has lost a great gift.  "

He was telling me I'm looking at c section. Well I refused, and was sent home until my 41 wk mark. Neat less to say I went into labor on my own and delivered 2 days before 41 wks. NATURALLY!! And Figuerres was my Dr. At delivery! She was amazing. Has an awesome personality, and a calming nature to her. I can honestly say I wish I had her all along. She does not believe in letting you tear and is great at keeping you calm even during uncomfortable situations. Thanks to her I have an amazing little man next to me now! Definitly reccomend this Dr.  To any woman with anxieties or that wants to not feel like labor is race to rush rush!! "
3809,40580,1.0,"Great GP doc, trustworthy, careful, and caring, and has very good staff. He refers and relates well to very good specialists.  I left one of those 'smarter, busier' doctors for him after rounds of too many unnecessary procedures and tests.  When he doesn't know, he tells you upfront and refers to the doctors who may know.  I prefer this sort of wisdom to pretentious and arrogant 'smarts'. Using his persistent and methodic approach he figured out a  gall bladder problem that had baffled the ER docs for 2 days. "
3810,40580,1.0,"Great experience for the past 7 years! My family goes to Dr. Feuerbach and we are very happy with the excellent care that he provides. Dr Steve (as we call him) is very knowledgable, yet willing to admit when he has a question regarding a problem - he has refered us to a couple of specialists, who were quite competent and supported Dr. Steve's recommendations. His staff has been responsive and friendly - willing to go the extra mile. My husband, children and I highly recommend Dr. Feuerbach without reservations! "
3811,40580,1.0,"This doctor has very good bedside manner and is very polite and caring. He does not seem to be as smart and knowledgeable as I would like him to be, but he is honest and will admit when he does not know something and he will find out for you. His office is computerized and he can access any information immediately. There are other (busier, smarter) family doctors in Kenosha but I am going to stick with this doctor because he really cares for his patients.  "
3812,40581,1.0,"Doctor Fenlon is a top-notch doctor who takes a collaborative approach to medicine. As a matter of fact, all the doctors in his office use this approach. I DO have a say in MY health care and he values my input as we plot a course of action for whatever I am there for. Great doctor, I wouldn't have anyone else! "
3813,40582,1.0,He was my pediatrician until I was 19 and was always very helpful and had a great bedside manner. I had no hesitation in choosing him to be my daughter's (due Aug '11) pediatrician and was actually relieved that he was still practicing. I'm glad that I don't have to hunt around for an excellent doctor that I can trust with my child's health and well-being.  
3814,40582,1.0, 
3815,40583,1.0,"Dr. Fleming has been my primary for at least 15 years.  He has always referred me when I needed referral.  He has believed me when I reported rare and painful side effects to specialist's treatments, and has provided pain relief (that the specialist would not) that made it possible to complete a year course of the medications needed.  He is kind and really listens.  I only regret that he is getting older, like me, and I will probably have to find another primary someday. "

I screamed at him to wait till the medicine kicked in and he just kept on doing it and I wound up screaming through the whole thing. No one came to help, I was wheeled back up and I was MAD and told my husband and everyone I saw what went on.  The nurse, male, came into the room and said &quot;you had meds&quot; &quot; you won't remember any of this.&quot;  I never was sleepy or went to sleep and my husband was there to prove it.  The nurse brought me a pain pill which helped then as I had to lay flat for 2 hours. I also heard him say (when I entered the room) that &quot;if it wasn't 75 to 80%  I am not touching it&quot;. I had 3 tests that all showed a problem with my heart and he said there is NOTHING wrong with your heart. "

3836,40598,1.0,Dr Fehr is a very knowledgeable and thorough doctor. He asks many questions and listens to the patient describing the issues. He is never in a hurry to complete the examination and is not a pill pusher but knows the interactions and effects of medicine. He is by far the best doctor I have ever had as a primary physician.  
3837,40598,1.0,Dr. Fehr has always gone out of his way to explain all matters to me thoroughly.  I have never felt rushed.  Dr Fehr goes out of his way to determine if everything discussed or done is clear. With a very specific and serious issue he diagnosed during a routine physical he called the specialist personally and I had surgery the following day. There are days that I thank God that Dr. Fehr took the time to diagnose the problem during a routine physical.  
3838,40598,1.0,. He is the only doctor that really cared and helped me! I don't know if I could have taken my pain and health issues on without him! Best doc me and my family has ever seen! He goes above and beyond if you are strait with him!!! Can't say thanks enough he probably saved my life! 
3839,40598,1.0,"no helpful at all..instead of helping me find a Rx, he perscribed another Rx that i sick on...i called him and he told me i had to come in and see him even though i found a pharmacy that had my original Rx... he is horrible "
3840,40598,1.0,"I believe Dr. Fehr is unaware of addition and alcoholic issues in all areas. Please, if you are prone to alcoholism or drug addiction, be extremely careful proceeding.  "
3841,40598,1.0,Dr. Fehr had a wonderful bedside manner. He explained my problem in a way that I could easily understand. I found his medical treatment of me and my family to be completely professional.  
3842,40598,1.0,"He will kill you. He knows jack about addition and prescribes anything you tell him to. Your definitely a number and cares little about the patient except the pharmaceutical industry. I had a back surgery in 04 and started me off on Fentynal 100mcg patches reserved for dyeing cancer patients. Go ahead if he appeals to you, but I for warned you that he will get you addicted so fast and hard the problem you went in with will seem like nothing.  "
3843,40599,1.0,"Have always LOVED Dr Fleming and his staff.  My own knowledge base was high dealing with MS my whole life (mother had it also)  I knew what could happen, and he has always made me feel okay about what was happening at that time.  He at one point even called me on Xmas eve to give me some blood test results.  He has always valued my opinion as well.   Very very knowledgable and also has very good bedside manner  :) "
3844,40600,1.0,Great Dentist.  I'm terrified of the dentist and he made me feel very at ease after 10 yrs of not going in at all.  His staff was so friendly and considerate of my fears.  Highly recommended. 
3845,40601,0.0,"Dr. Fleming delivered 2 of my 3 children. She is very professional, caring, gentle. She takes a natural approach to pregnancy and childbirth reducing the need for unnecessary procedures and interventions. She will listen to your concerns and will take the time to answer any questions, but she will not sugar coat anything. She is honest and straight forward. She is also very open and will work with you on your birth plan, rather than work against you like many OBs do.  "
3846,40601,0.0,"I love Dr. Fleming. She walked me thru two pregnacies and delivered one. She is so friendly and open, I could take to her about anything and not feel embarassed. Unfortunately she has moved to Colorado.  We'll miss you :-( "
3847,40601,0.0,Dr. Fleming is a great doctor and very knowledagable. She listens to your concerns and answers all your questions. You can tell she really cares about you. She is also a great doctor to have during the delivery of your child. 
3848,40602,0.0,"she acted like i was faking the pain in my leg. She made me go get x-rays then said she would write me a prescription when she got the x-rays back, but never did. I would not recommend her to ANYBODY - who is not African-American, because she is obviously **** against white people.  "
3849,40603,0.0,Dr. Fogarty is WONDERFUL!! She is very knowledgeable and compassionate. She really cares about her patients.  
3850,40603,0.0,Very good with my 13 year old and answered questions clearly.  Made her feel at ease.  
3851,40604,1.0,"When I had seen Dr. Fagan, I did not have the same experience as the rest of the posters.  I felt very uncomfortable with him.  The things that were said to me were not very professional.  "
3852,40604,1.0,"Dr Fagan and his fellow doctors delivered my third son. I adore this man. He treated my family with the greatest respect and enthusiasm. His bedside manner in the delivery room exuded cheer and confidence. He always remembers to ask about my husband's cancer treatment, asks about my work, and even gave me his cell phone number when I was feeling particularly ill.  What kind of doctor does that&#63; "
3853,40604,1.0,"Dr. Fagan is one of the best gynecologists I've ever been to. When I moved from IL to WI I was looking for a new Dr. and boy did I find the right one! He is professional, caring, funny, very knowledgable and has the best &quot;bedside manner&quot; that I've ever encountered.  He is always there for his patients! When my daughter and her husband were expecting their first child I told my daughter to go and talk to Dr. Fagan and if she wasn't impressed then to look at others. As soon as they got home she called me and told me how much they were crazy for Dr. Fagan! He was so patient with her and all of their questions and explained every step of how everything was going to go.  She ended up having an 11 lb. 5 oz. healthy baby boy. But they knew he was going to be a big boy because of the close attention he paid to my daughter.  If you are looking for the best, call Dr.  Fagan in Kenosha! "
3854,40604,1.0,"Dr Fagan was great until if was time to deliver my child.  He didnt seem open to discussing my birth plan.  He also didnt explain that he was giving me an internal monitor- (which I got an infection from), I didnt get a chance to labor the way I wanted to because nothing was explained to me and I was given no choices about what I wanted.  I would have picked another pratice had I known my delivery would have been such a poor experience.  Dont get me wrong, Dr Fagan is nice and a VERY fun and warm person but feeling comfortable during my delivery was more important to me.  "
3855,40604,1.0,I have been seeing Dr.  Fagan for 18 years and have followed him from IL to WI!  There's no way I'd see anyone else-he's simply the best!!!!!!!! 
3856,40604,1.0,I loved dr. fagan and all his staff! He wasn't my original dr. but ended up delivering me! He was so nice...and took the time to listen to me. The other two docs were great too! They all know what they are talking about and are on the same page.  I would recommend anyone to any of these doctors.  
3857,40604,1.0,"I was nervous about a guy ob/gyn, but Dr. Fagan made our prenatal care an enjoyable experience.  He is always in a cheerful mood, which is very nice! He is also very knowledgeable and has great bedside manner! I will refer anyone who needs a great doctor to him, and the entire practice! "
3858,40604,1.0,Dr. Fagan is always in a good mood and it is contagious. He is caring and respectful. 
3859,40604,1.0,"I've been going to Dr. Fagan for 20 years. He is a smart, caring professional that loves what he does. I wouldn't trade him for anyone! "
3860,40604,1.0,"I love their whole practice. Even though Dr. Fagan was not the one who delivered my daughter, I met with him several times during my first pregnancy. All 3 doctors seem to communicate well between themselves and were always on the same page when it came to my care. I am currently seeing them again for another pregnancy and couldn't be happier.  "
3861,40604,1.0,"Wonderful bedside manner, takes the time to explain everything and cares about his patients.  "
3862,40605,0.0,She was very helpful and cared very much about ME.  
3863,40605,0.0,"Was very rude and not sensitive to miscarriage diagnosis. Would never return to her, she made us wait at least 30 min and then interrogated us. Lack of sensitivity and information was unbearable. Terrible experience with this dr! "
3864,40606,1.0,"Luke Fortney is probably the most knowledgeable, ethical, and dedicated doctors that I have ever seen during my extensive medical history.  I found him after a long search for help for a very complex medical condition that multiple surgeons and medical providers had been unable to help.  When I saw him I was totally disabled and sure I would be dead within the year.  Now almost 1.5 years later, I am not only still alive, but thriving -- back at work, exercising, and enjoying leisure activities again with friends.  I have my life back because he succeeded where others had failed.  He takes time and care, he keeps on top of research and innovations, and he is focused on doing what is right for patients rather than simply what is &quot;treatment as usual&quot;.  I now have sent several people to him, and all have said the same thing -- he is an extremely helpful, bright, and competent doctor. "
3865,40607,1.0,"1) When it comes to a woman's organs - no one is better educated. 2) He's a fast and furious kind of doctor. Very efficient and enjoys helping many patients in one day. He is more likely to squeeze desperate patients into his schedule, which does make him late sometimes (often). 3) He is very thorough, and in my experience as long as I tell he and his nurse everything, he explains everything and they take care of me. 4) Dr. Fok is a specialist, if you want someone to hold your hand over every little thing, go see your primary. I've had 4 high risk babies with him, all resulting in successful deliveries and healthy children. "
3866,40607,1.0,"I went through a few pregnancies and a complicated medical history with Dr. Fok. My first was a stillbirth that had no complications until no heartbeat at a routine check at nine months. He was there to see me to deliver despite it being his day off to attend church. With my next baby, he kept me on successful bedrest by trying a newer med at 20 weeks when my water broke that saw me through to nearly 27 weeks when I delivered my now 10 year old healthy daughter. (She would not have survived otherwise at 20 weeks.) At the time I was worried about a repeat and no longer wanted to have children, but he suggested I wait to decide. I did wait and now have three more blessings later. I do wish he would have recommended some genetic testing though -- that was likely the cause determined later for the losses and premature birth (thrombosis), and I did have other miscarriages. All in all, a good person, a busy doctor, and tries to do the best for all his patients.  "
3867,40607,1.0,Completely missed diagnosing a very simple problem. I thought something was weird that he would miss this. I even pointed it out and nothing! Highly NOT recommended! 
3868,40607,1.0,"was referred to Dr. Fok by my family practiioner as a well respected OB/GYN in Madison. I have had persistent dysplasia for years and he hes been very helpful in providing options for treatment. He is direct and to the point be prepared to be your own advocate as should be done with any doctor. While personable, he's not someone who is warm and fuzzy but I'm more interested him for his knowledge v. being someone to chat with. I have found his key nurse to be extreamly compassionate and helpful. I stongly recommend Dr. Fok and his staff. Not the most timely office but I believ he's well worth the wait. "
3869,40607,1.0,Irresponsible attitude and leave an unprofessional report on patient's record.  Highly not recommanded.  
3870,40607,1.0,"I disagree with the first entry.  Dr Fok is an excellent doctor, very caring and compationate.  It is his schedule at the clinics, in which he has little control of that would make him late and is out of his control.  He is an OB doc and does have to deliver babies which would be out of his control when these happen.  I have never had any problems asking him my questions and having them answered.  He is very knowledgeable...  An absolute wonderful doctor. "
3871,40607,1.0,"I not only had to travel for an hour to be on time for my appointment, but still wait for another hour to be assisted taking into account that I had to ask them twice how much longer I had to wait. Finally, this man showed up treating me like an animal, without having the minimum care on my person and hurting me badly.The only thing he said was something about wearing a cream and see me again in a month.And that was it.He left when I had many questions to ask him about my health problems and concerns but, he did not let me talk when I attempted to ask.  I feel that his patients mean nothing to him but numbers. Where is the professionalism and HUMAN concern of this doctor for his patients&#63; I think he should get a training on human relations and how to listen before continuing making feel bad more patients.I wasted my time and left with even more questions and a lot of physical pain. He was rough and not careful at all besides being rude and impolite.A real doctor listens an cares! "
3872,40608,1.0,"Great doctor! Very knowledgeable, caring, and takes his time with his patients.  I highly recommend him! "
3873,40608,1.0,He is a wonderful doctor.  Very patient and takes the time to explain everything to both the child and the parent.  You never feel rushed. . .you can tell he really cares and loves his job.  
3874,40608,1.0,Great Doctor...always caring..takes his time with you...very knowledgable...very personable..great with kids...my boys love him! 
3875,40609,1.0,Very nice appointment and he spent alot of time with me. He made sure we covered everything I wanted to discuss and I would definitely see him again.  
3876,40609,1.0,very poor with knowing information about the elderly.  sent an 89 year old man with heart failure and pneumonia home with an antibiotic. and then later ended up in hospital and still didn't think i should go to nursing home to get rehab.  
3877,40609,1.0,"He was was very average, but did fine. My minor complaint was that he really didn't spend very much time with me in the exam. room. However, his treatment plan did work and he was very friendly throughout the appointment. He isn't my PCP, but I would go back to him if I couldn't get an appointment with my regular doctor. "
3878,40610,0.0,"Listens, Knowledgeable, and will research when she needs too. "
3879,40611,2.0,. great 
3880,40612,1.0,"Dr. Fink was very kind, caring and knowledgable. He re-built a molar using the ultra-violet light composite technique. It was a great alternative to a root canal and looks like the molar I was born with. I save $1100 dollars  and can chew anything.  One of the best dentists I ever had! "
3881,40613,1.0,"Dr.Farnen is one of the most compasionate phyician I have ever  encountered. He does run later at times for his appointments, but that is due to his overall concern and thoroughness he has for his patients. If I had to wait 1 1/2hrs past my appointment time to see him, I would.  His knowledge and care he has for his patients is well worth the wait. If he is running late, his staff comes and notifies you that he is running late.  Then they will ask you if there is anything they can get for you to make your wait more comfortable.  I would highly recommend Dr. Farnen for anyone needing a Hematologist.  "
3882,40614,0.0,I really enjoyed Dr. Fossum.  She is very caring and understanding.  She could also relate with me on having a smaller than average child.  She was great with my kids and they actually liked going in for checkups.  
3883,40615,1.0,Dr. Fitzpatrick was on call when our 19 year old son came to the hospital in cardiac arrest.  Dr.  Fitzpatrick saved our sons life and is doing great! 
3884,40615,1.0,Dr. Dennis Fitzpatrick is a caring person and he stands out as a fine doctor of medicine. He is the type of person who supports a person fully. I felt confident that he could handle any difficult situation or emergency that came up in ICU. Dr.Fitzpatrick and the cardiac team that came from Cleveland Ohio to Fond du Lac Wisconsin I think is an asset to the community and I am thankful they are here every time I hear an ambulance. I know the person is recieving good care. 
3885,40616,1.0,Dr. Fetherston has been my doctor for 16 years he's an awsome and trustworthy doctor one of the best. Even though he is late alot he is a very busy man.   I will always go to dr mike he also seems like family to me my well alost whole entire family goes to dr f 
3886,40616,1.0,"He's been my doctor for my entire life, he has also been my mother's doctor since she was 15 or so. He's late sometimes, but not exceedingly so. Very funny, very intelligent.  "
3887,40616,1.0,I have been a patient of Dr Fetherston for over 15 years. and I can't say enough good about him. 
3888,40616,1.0,His bedside manner is friendly. He is very intelligent. He is very patient. He is an expert in prescribing medications.  
3889,40617,1.0,Dr. Findling has since changed from the last review listed!  He is an AMAZING doctor.  He listened to me and was able to diagnose the very uncommon Cushing's Disease when others dismissed me as simply being overweight.  He literally saved my life.  I am now almost a year post-op and can not thank him enough :) 
3890,40617,1.0,"I was very disappointed at how this practice has gone downhill over the years.  It was supposed to be the place to go if you had a diabetes or thyroid problem.  Dr. Findling used to actually see his patients and now he doesn't even show up for appointments.  He cancelled on me for a year and a half straight, without any notice.  I showed up for six visits without knowledge that my appointments had been cancelled.  I had friends who also used to go there, due to my referrals who have now moved on to other physicans as well due to similar disappointments.  Once couldn't get her diabetes meds refilled because she hadn't had a regular follow-up.  She had to remind them that they had cancelled on her a half dozen times, not the other way around, and they still refused to fill it.  She had to go to the ER. "
3891,40618,0.0,"Dr Fifield is very down to earth and very knowledgeable with what she does!!!! I was ifie about seeing her at first but absolutely love her!!! Her other co doctors, are the one that are VERY rude.   Her office manager is only worried about money, she only comes out when you owe them money!!! And she's very inconsiderate!!! I wish Dr Fifield would start her own practice, she would be amazing by herself :) "
3892,40618,0.0,Dr Fifield has absolutely NO bedside manner!  She talked down to me on several occasions and pretty much looks at you like you are a complete idiot if you have questions.  I will not be returning to this pratice. She ruined a good portion of being a patient at this office.  
3893,40618,0.0,"I had to see Dr. Fifield when I had a miscarriage.  I usually saw Dr. Fagan or Robinson, but unfortunately, they weren't available.  I was going to let the miscarriage happen naturally instead of having the D&C;, but I felt that Dr. Fifield scared/pressured me into having the surgery, telling me the natural miscarriage was as painful as contractions and I could go that route if I could &quot;handle&quot; the pain and I might have to have the D&C; anyways. She spoke down to me and had no bedside manor.  She made me feel worse about the situation I was in.  One reviewer said Dr. Fifield tells it like it is, which I don't mind as long as there is some compassion behind it. I would NOT recommend her to anyone, and if you choose to go to this practice, see either Dr. Fagan or Robinson, as they are both kind and knowledgeable.  Because of the treatment by Dr. Fifield, I have decided not to return to this practice.  "
3894,40618,0.0,"I was not happy with the care Dr. Fifield gave me. Her office staff was not very educated. At one point, the nurse was not sure if my daughter's heart defect, which she was born with, should be classified as a birth defect. Also, the doctor seemed too concerned about giving me more than 1 ultrasound because she said she would have to justify extra ultrasounds to the insurance company. Even though my child has a heart condition that is genetic. To top it off, the accountant at the doctor's office expects me to start paying for the c section next month, when I will be only 16 weeks. Came away from this visit thinking that this office is mostly concerned with money. Am looking for a new obgyn. "
3895,40618,0.0,I really like Dr. Fifield. She is very knowledgeable and friendly. I feel very comfortable at my appts with her. She usually runs right on time. My only complaint would be that the front desk staff at her office is a bit unprofessional.  
3896,40618,0.0,"I love their whole practice. I met with all 3 doctors during my first and current pregnancy. They seem to communicate well between themselves and were always on the same page when it came to my care. Dr. Fifield delivered my daughter. She was calm, professional and a comfort. I would be completely at ease and thrilled if she was on call to deliver baby #2 as well. I can't say enough positive things about this wonderful group.  "
3897,40619,1.0,He is amazing - I am able to get appointments for kids at a moments notice. Takes as much time during exam session as I need. 
3898,40620,1.0,"Dr. Jim Fogarty is the best suregon I have ever been to. He has a Mayo  background. He is extremely smart. He is very kind. Always listens. Has Clinic's in Rice lake, Hayward, Cable, Wisconsin. He is the only Doctor that takes walk-ins. He is the best! "
3899,40621,1.0,"I believe Dr. Feigal is a wonderful openminded physician. He respected my wishes/issues and worked with me to find an answer. Medical Facility was also filled with welcoming staff, and clean facilities. "
3900,40621,1.0,Very open minded and friendly. He respects my input for shared decision making. He is professional and personable too. 
3901,40622,2.0,Dr. Faudree is a excellent doctor. The care our family receives is beyond what we would expect from a doctor.  
3902,40623,1.0,"If you're looking for a doctor who will truly listen and take the time you need to discuss your medical issues, Dr. Fenster should be your doctor. He always provides superior advice and treatment.  Easy to get in to see him.  Prompt in keeping appointment times.  Makes a real effort to get to know his patients.  Highly recommend this doctor. "
3903,40623,1.0,"He's a little quiet, but he is very nice and smart.  A great doctor. "
3904,40624,1.0,Dr. Faustich is a fantastic doctor. He makes you feel like you are his most important patient. Very knowledgeable and answers questions clearly.  
3905,40624,1.0,"Dr. Faustich has made my high risk pregnancy a little more bearable.  He always gets me in for samd day appointments if I'm having any trouble, is always on time, and is very thorough with tests, exams, etc. I'm now 6 months pregnant, a miracle after 3 miscarriages!  I have no doubt that it's Dr. Faustich's excellent care that has made this baby possible! "
3906,40624,1.0,"This is one doctor anyone can trust. He is very polite. Very punctual, Very understanding, very helpful, and Absolutely VERY KNOWLEDGABLE.. AND has a very nice staff I couldn't say enough about this doctor but Dr.  Faustich is a super doctor "
3907,40624,1.0,He is absolutely loved by his patients. He is very thorough and quite likeable. 
3908,40626,0.0,Very friendly and takes the time to listen.  She has moved to her own practice. 
3909,40626,0.0,"Dr. Fosso is the best, she is honest and kind. I always feel she makes time for me! "
3910,40626,0.0,"Dr. Fosso is great!  She is friendly, helpful, and she gets you in and out.  She listened to my concerns and pain, and she proscribed appropriate treatments.  My pain dimished significantly and my mobility increased back to my usual self. "
3911,40627,1.0,Very rude..would recommend going to someone else. Very unprofessional. 
3912,40627,1.0,Dr. Fay swore during two of my recent visits.  He was rough on my mouth during most visits.  He did not return to the room after a visit for a crown.  The last person I saw was the dental assistant.  The final straw for me was when he told me I was annoying him because I was not relaxing when he was drilling out a cavity.  I will be finding a new dentist. 
3913,40628,1.0,"Dr Fard, came in on his day off to help my mother in law who had a broken tooth.  He has an incredible sense of humor, and treats you like family.  Highly recommend him. "
3914,40628,1.0,"Dr. Fard helped me multiple times with replacing a broken tooth.  He has extremely helpful and kind, and made the implant as painless as possible.  I highly recommend him. "
3915,40628,1.0,Dr. Fard is incredibly personable and makes you feel like his most important patient.  He does excellent work and I am looking forward to having him as my dentist for years to come. 
3916,40628,1.0,Dr. Fard does a great job.  I have referred many friends and family to them and all agree. 
3917,40629,1.0,"The BEST Cardiologist in Milwaukee, WI. He discovered I had a congenitally defective Aortic valve and hooked me up with the best Cardio-surgeon in this city/state (DR. PAUL H. WERNER) in May 2010.  My Aortic valve was replaced and I am now alive and well, thanks to Dr. Thomas G. Fenske.  He is a very down to earth person, has great bedside manner and knows his stuff.  I highly recommend him to anyone needing a good Cardiologist.  I would not have lived much longer without his diagnosis and insistance that I have the surgery when I did.  I didn't think I needed it, he told me why I needed it and that I need it immediately.  I listened to him and I am glad I did. Dr.  Fenske is the best!! "
3918,40629,1.0,Excellent Cardioligist.Very caring.Uses a lot of diagnostic tests to make sure of the right diagnosis. Saved my life! 
3919,40630,1.0,"Peter is the best psychiatric care I have ever had. He helped me to notice things about myself that I never did, like ADHD and OCD. Not major cases of either, but just enough to cause difficulties in daily life. He doesnt just prescribe medication, but tells you about them and the side effects and how others have responded to them. He discusses what you want in a medication and you choose which one you want, to a degree. I would not want to let anyone else pick my brain. I have felt a lot better since i started seeing him last year. I even transferred to his new facility because I wont see anyone else. Peter makes you feel like your talking to your best friend, like you have known him all your life. I cant say I have trusted anyone else more than him.  He deserves an award of some sort! "
3920,40630,1.0,He was good to me. Its a darn shame that he has to Leave Aurora. That will be a LOSS for those of us in the Green Bay.  
3921,40630,1.0,"Took a couple times for him to really get my problems, complex symptoms always take a while for doctors to get.  I rate a doctor not by what position in their class they graduated or how fancy the clothes are, but instead I want a doctor that is intellectual curios about my case, which Dr Fischer does very good job for me.  He doesn't just ask me what pills I want, he diagnoses the symptoms by what he sees and hears from me.  Might not work for some, but it works for me because I didn't go to school like he did and don't have the patient experiences like him.  He is a very good doctor that takes time to listen/understand the problem (even if appt runs long).  He is down to earth (not snobish) and is also interested in my overall well-being.  My counselor (Phd level) and him interact about my case when one sees something the other might want to know. He takes a picture 1st appt for his file to put a face to your phone calls.  My only problem with him is some of his nurses aren't good.  "
3922,40630,1.0,"No reassement on pateints for prior issues, makes judgements with no recent visit, Will not talk with patients over the phone!!!!  Just another pill pusher...........  "
3923,40631,1.0,"Dr Foster is a hand surgeon who performed carpel tunnel surgery on me.  I woke after surgery with the nerves cut to my 2 middle fingers.  He wouldn't address the problem, and I was forced to seek help elsewere.  A subsequent surgery by another doctor repaired one finger, but I was left with one painful finger.  The second surgeon advised that Dr Foster had not even opened the &quot;tunnel&quot; during the initial surgery.  I should have known when I saw how abusive verbally he was to his staff.

He as since left town and can not be found if he reads this I would like to say what a jerk he is face the fact that you made a mistake and own up to it.  other good doctors would. I would NEVER send anyone to you.  
3930,40635,1.0,Unprofessional.   I felt as if he was interested only in selling me on a laser treatment for hair rather that dealing with my issues

He works from a M.C.W clinic, Plank Road Clinic on Mayfair Road.                                    Clinic staff and nurses are great, helpful and pleasant.  "

He is friendly and takes a genuine interest in the patient.  He is quick--I think the longest appointment I've ever had was 5 minutes.  However, he's effective.  Highly recommend him! "
3942,40646,1.0,"Ford wants you in and out as quick as possible.  Crack your back, thanks, see you next time.  When I went back to him a second time, he did not even seem to remember me or what I was there for, did a hurry up job, and took off to see his next patient. "
3943,40647,1.0,This man listens and cares. Is straight forward without being brusque. Will bend over backwards to listen and help. Always responds to phone calls and returns same. Treats each family individually. Never pawns you off on his PA unless you want that. He's saved my life and my daughters life more than once. He's great with kids as well as older adults.

3945,40648,0.0,Dr fetter is very good listener.Very helpful.And Knowledgable 
3946,40648,0.0,Dr. Fetter is extremely UNPROFESSIONAL. One of my clients sees her and he is terrified. She hangs up on people and thinks because she's a &quot;doctor&quot; that she knows everything. She talks down to people who don't have the same level of education as her. She should get her license revoked. Don't waste your time.  She's a quack! 
3947,40648,0.0,"Unfortunately, Dr. Fetter &quot;misdiagnosed&quot; psychiatric disorders that eventually lead to EPS and left me in the ER convulsing. After sharing my story, I found that she is known in the community for overprescribing and a lack of attention to contraindications. While she is a great listener, the combination of samples and scripts made my outcome impossible for a pharmacist to track. The process which led up to EPS took one month, ten medications and ten visits (a new med per visit) to a never before diagnosed, healthy woman seeking stress management info.  "
3948,40649,0.0,.  
3949,40649,0.0,She is a wonderful doctor. Her accounting practices terrible. The bills were never accurate and the insurance company not properly billed. I hate to leave a good doctor but I cannot afford their mistakes.  
3950,40649,0.0,"I found Dr. Fernando online for Thyroid treatment after seeing no results with my current doctor. She not only got my thyroid back to normal using natural hormones, she discovered the cause of my weight gain: hyperinsulinemia.     Other doctors just relied on my blood sugar tests, which are normal. Dr. Fernando also tests for the amount of INSULIN in the blood because high levels mean your carbs are not processing correctly and going directly to the fat cells.     I've lost over 50lbs!     Dr. Fernando sits down with you and goes over all of your blood test results and explains them to you. Like a detective, she gets to the root of the problem and treats the CAUSE, not just the symptoms! "
3951,40649,0.0,"Dr. Fernando helped me a lot! When I was younger, I ate the wrong foods and never exercised.  My parents would take me to sports and such but I wasn't budging. My pediatrician just said i was lazy and overweight, a nutritionist didnt help either. I didn't know what to do. I came in to see Dr.F when I was 16 years old and 210lbs.  It was always hard for me to lose weight.  We ended up looking at my blood tests and she explained that my fatigue and cravings were due to my quick drops in blood sugar levels and my high levels of insulin.  I was diagnosed with hyperinsulinemia.  I was only 16, but she drew a picture for me on a piece of paper explaining the functions and why and how I was hyperinsulinemic.  She prescribed me some meds and I continued to see her for one and half more years on a regular basis.  When I was 18, I went to my senior prom in a size 9 dress.  I weiged 135.  I'm now 20 years old and still in the 130s.  I have a better understanding of my body thanks to Dr. Fernando.  "
3952,40649,0.0,"Excellent doctor, however works between two states- WI &amp; Florida,so think it's difficult for them to stay on top of things. Have had difficulty getting by statements to send in for my eflex plan and had a hard time getting thyroid- went without it for almost 2 months with the tyroid shortage. "
3953,40649,0.0,I was very disappointed with her staff - they are very rude and do not understand insurance billing procedures. Dr. Fernando was also a disappointment as she cancels appointments frequently and won't give lab results for months. (I would not recommend her) 
3954,40649,0.0,Very poor record keeping.  Dr. Fernando cancels appointments frequently. I have to call the office for lab results and it takes weeks to get them.  I have had high lab results and have not been advised what to do about it. I have also requested paperwork from this office over a month ago and still have not received it.  Dr. Fernando is knowledgable and has helped me. but I have had to seek another doctor for my care. 
3955,40649,0.0,"Dr. Fernando was the best thing that happened to me. I went from doctor to doctor trying to find out why I wasn't feeling good and couldn't get better. I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism and put on Syntroid but no changes. Docs agreed my thyroid level was still off but just told me to go on anti-depressant! That is when I went to the library and did some research. Read Mary Shomans' Book about Thyroid Disease and found out about Dr. Fernando. She took tests, explained the results to me and how she was going to help me feel better. She was right on. Dr. Fernando prescibred Thyroid, which actually forces your thyroid to start working again and I feel normal again! I highly recommend her. She also looks at your other hormone levels as they are all related. Found my levels were out of sinc in several areas.  She knows what she is talking about! "
3956,40649,0.0,"Dr. Fernando claims to be a top doctor for thyroid conditions; however, she specializes in bariatrics so unless you have a weight problem related to your thyroid, I would not recommend her. Her rates are very high ($270 for initial visit-$250 for follow-ups) and my insurance benefits were reduced by 20% because she can not admit to a hospital. I had my thyroid level checked and it was extremely low (.07) and I did not receive a foloow-up call from her in over a week. It was not until I called the office and had my test results faxed to me that I realized I needed to reduce my medication. Her reception area is expensively decorated with antiques/artwork but her examination rooms consist of a folding chair and cupboard on the wall. Don't waste your time with this doctor. "

He was demeaning and treated me like a 5 year old.  He questioned me as if I was wasting his time.  All I can say is stay away.   BAD DR! "
3961,40655,1.0,"Great Doc! Always willing to take my call and answer any of my questions. Really cares about his patients and making sure that they are comfortable. Even when he is running a bit behind, I have never felt like he rushed my appointment or gave my concerns any less attention. Would tell anyone looking for a knowledgeable and caring doc to pick Dr. Fait. "
3962,40655,1.0,"I had issues with two pregnancies and thanks to Dr Fait  I have my daughter now. If you have questions - call your doc, don't assume that they will call you to talk about your pills, as they busy delivering babies and taking care of complicated pregnancies.  "
3963,40655,1.0,"Dr. Fait's office staff are always helpful and attentive.  They are happy to help with questions, and the doctor will return your calls timely.  They are always punctual and I always feel like I have an opportunity to ask questions with the Doctor providing options.  I would recommend him for anyone who wants a doctor who has experience, knowledge and a great bedside manner.  "
3964,40655,1.0,"Dr. Fait is wonderful! He takes a lot time explaining and makes sure I understand what he means untill I'm comfortable.  He's always been so patient, easy to reach, and helpful! Out of the 3 different dr's I've had with my 3 pregnancies he's by far been the best "
3965,40655,1.0,"I do not recommend this doctor. He's much too busy to care about individual patient concerns. Each appointment feels rushed. He also prescribed birth control pills to me for five years without checking to see if there were other methods to regulate my period. I found a way to regualte my period on my own! Also, if you want to switch doctors, Dr. Fait will charge $30 to transfer your records.  Don't bother with him!! "
3966,40656,1.0,"Very impatient. Prescribed medications to treat my symptoms, not my disease. Made me feel like I was wasting his time during every appointment! Months of doing bloodwork (which results I was never informed of...and some even &quot;lost&quot;). Have had many &quot;miscommunications&quot; about starting and stopping medications. "
3967,40656,1.0,Whipped off a dx of fibro without even loking at anything else. Did not want to seem to bother with you. His knowledge on fibro did not correspond to the info I had collected on that dx. 
3968,40656,1.0,Doesn't understand or listen well to his patients. Prefers to do blood tests and prescribe meds rather than get to the root problems. Gets frustrated easily with his patients. Has no backbone to his colleges. 
3969,40657,0.0,I am totaly happy with the knowledge and care My wife and I get from Dr Fish. He diagnosed my wife's breast cancer in time to save her life or the further spread of cancer.

He does not give up and if he cannot find a solution to your problem / illness he is not afraid to refer you to a specialists who may be able to help you further. My husband, I and our daughter go to Dr. Fish and all are thoroughly pleased with the level of service and care he and his office provides for us. Both my parents, as well see Dr. John Fish as their primary care doctor. He is excellent with seniors, he'll take extra care and time to explain to them-----understanding that seniors may have memory and / or hearing problems. "
3973,40658,1.0,"Dr. Flood was very condescending to me (the mother of the patient) when I asked for a consultation prior my child receiving nitrous oxide for sedation during treatment for her cavities.  He was obviously annoyed that I would as for a consultation prior to him working on my child.  Both my husband and I have medical back-grounds (nurse practitioner and physician assistant) and he spoke to me in the most unprofessional, condescending manner- I was beyond upset.  I allowed him to treat my daughter that day, but I have since changed providers.  THERE ARE OTHER PEDIATRIC DENTIST IN THE LACROSSE AND ONALASKA AREA! Just open your phone book and make a call.  If  you like a long wait, being treated disrespectfully and having someone &quot;care&quot; for YOUR child in such a cold-hearted manner, than this is the office for you!  For me, I have taken my business elsewhere! "

3975,40658,1.0,Excellent experience!  My son was very aprehensive and Dr. Flood put him at ease.  He took the time to talk to me about my son's teeth and gave excellent advice.  My son is only four and thinks very highly of Dr. Flood.  A great experience! 
3976,40658,1.0,"This was to be our kids 1st dental appointments as a family we were very excited to see Dr Flood. When we walked into the office I was blown over by the smell of burning candles. What kind of kids office burns candles&#63; We waited in the office for 30 minutes. I went up to the desk &amp; asked how much longer, we were advised it would be soon. 20 minutes later we were called back &amp; again waited another 10 minutes we realized it had been an hour. I asked to speak to Dr Flood and told him that it was wrong to have us wait for an hour.  His only response was that this was &quot;pediatric dentistry!&quot;  Did he expect me to say oh then that's ok. I advised him that I would not be coming back and his response to me was &quot;we will be just fine without you!&quot;  Wow! How unprofessional. This guy has no patients for adults I would hate to see him with my little guys. So if your looking for some friendly service and want to be appreciated for your business this guy is not 4 you. "
3977,40659,1.0,I am thrilled with Dr. Fishbaugh!! I was hating my teeth and he is making me want to smile again! I had ground my top front teeth short and he lengthened them a bit. They look AWESOME! Thanks Dr.  Fishbaugh

3984,40663,1.0,"Super Dentist! I've lived in many parts of the US and have had a number of different dentist, but this guy is by far the best I've ever had. Cost is comparatively moderate. Staff is courtious, knowledgeable and helpful. They do all the claims paperwork. Dr. Farrow is extremely good with the needle, careful to not cause too much pain. Considerate (always explains the procedures and discusses options). He is very fussy (and good) about the fit and functionality of his work. "
3985,40664,1.0,Dr Fenske is very nice and will sit down and explain what all of the options that are available and explain why he is choosing the option he is choosing. He has answered every question I have had and not had any problem taking extra  time if needed. He also is very accommodating. I feel very safe in knowing I'm getting some of the best care from Dr Fenske.  
3986,40665,1.0,Only met for the surgery. Had problems afterwards and was only seen by his associates who offered no real solutions. The staff wanted to make it look like I achieved 20/20 vision so kept hollering at me to blink and squint so that I could read the eye chart. Have had halos and poor night vision since my lasik. Second opinion says that I never had my astigmatism corrected so I have to wear glasses to correct it. Overall I am not happy w/ the care received.  
3987,40665,1.0,Spent very little time with me--staff did most of the work not him.   Seemed very anxious to do surgery

Encephalitis, drug addiction, heart disease, hysterectomy, thyroid disease, affecting different family members, Dr. Fischer has been an extraordinary physician for our family. Refers to specialists when necessary.  Always very thorough and excellent, professional interaction with us.  I highly recommend him. "
3993,40669,1.0,I have had several major health issues over the past 6 years and he has handled them with competency.  He may not seem to make time for &quot;whiners&quot; but he truly cares when it is warrented or needed. I think he is excellent.  His nurses are great but the front office staff can be somewhat snotty though. 
3994,40669,1.0,He was right on with his diagnosis and treatment. I had seen several soca that didn't do anything for me.  
3995,40669,1.0,"My son and I have been patients of Dr. Fischer's for several years now.  While he may not be warm and fuzzy, he is a very good doctor.  With all of our combined illnesses he has been wonderful, and when we needed to see specialists he did not hesitate to refer us or run unneeded test.  All in all I would call him a wonderful and compatent doctor. "
3996,40669,1.0,Dr. Fischer seemed a bit defensive when I wanted to discuss therapy options. Maybe he was just having a busy day.  
3997,40681,1.0," I saw him to get a lesions removed. He was skilled, but I didn't like his staff at all. They were dismissive and insisted on doing paperwork for BC/BS PPO. I paid up front. I had a referral letter and that made it tricky. (I would have done it myself, but they wouldn't let me). They did it WRONG and then wouldn't correct it. I called and it took weeks to get a response phone call. Lots of running around on my part and stonewalling on theirs. I'm still fighting with BC/BS. Lots of time spent on this. I might go to this doctor again under different circumstances.  "
3998,40681,1.0," Dr. Isenberg was WONDERFUL, he made me feel completely comfortable, answered all my questions and was extremely knowledgable. "

4003,40705,1.0," Dr I darraga has been my Dr for 14 years. The reason I continued to see him from the first time we met was because of his wonderful bedisde manner. He has never been anything but kind and gentle mannered. He takes the time to talk with you and discusses appropriate treatments. He does occassionaly run behind, but that is because he is always putting the patients first. His nurses are nice and will alway call with prompt test results, and if you have questions, they get right back too you. He has helped me through several serious illnesses, and continues to see what is the proper and updated ways to address medicals needs. But even before I was sick, he was still the gentle and caring Doctor that I was looking for as a Young adult, and know that I'm older he continues to meet my needs. "
4004,40705,1.0, Dr Idarraga has been my primary physician for almost 15 years.  He always takes extra time to listen to my concerns and is always able to put me at ease.  He has excellent interpersonal skills and always follows up with me if any lab work is ordered.  I am very pleased to have him as my primary care physician and now he is my son's doctor too.  
4005,40705,1.0," Dr Idarraga is very cold and does not try to get to know you as a person. He is very factual and is very inattentive to the emotional side of things. He does not have a personality. He is the team physician for the local pro basketball team, and he does not attend to the needs of women.  "
4006,40705,1.0, Ive been with Dr. Idarraga for almost ten years a s patient and Im very please with the treatment I have gotten.

She has a new office with Columbia in Wauwatosa, and I am still loyally with her. She is simply the best. What a kind compassionate doctor! She's smart, progressive, and has a lot of common sense too. My husband likes how she is so good with the dads, and really wants the pregnancy to be positive for the couple. Two of my pregnancies were difficult, but I always felt I had the best of care, and could ask anything because she would take the time with me.  She will go to bat for her patients, and give it to you straight, but with tact.  "
4009,40709,0.0," I have know Dr. Irland since she was a resident. It is so great to know that she hasn't lost that human aspect of medicine. I first saw her when I was 17yrs.old and I am now 38yrs.old. I haven't found another physician that can measure up to Dr. Irland. I would highly recommend her to anyone that is looking for a well educated, modern yet caring and compassionate OB/Gyn. I only wish I lived closer to Dr. Irland, so she could still be my physician. .  "
4010,40709,0.0," Dr Irland is the best...She was very helpful and extremely patient with her clients.  I had given birth before in San Francisco, the doctor out there was also great--But Jacqueline was superior!!!She does tend to be late for her appts because she really takes the time to talk and discuss with her clients---so it is a catch 22.  "
4011,40709,0.0," Dr. Irland is compassionate and encouraging, always making sure you are comfortable and your needs and beliefs are considered. She is passionate about ensuring her patients are educated in all their options so you can do whatever is best for you. Whether you are searching for a supportive OB for a natural birth or doctor to help you through the pain and anxiety of childbirth, you should meet Dr. Irland. In what can often be a very vunerable and scary time, Dr. Irland made me feel confident and comfortable and involved me in all aspects of my and my newborns care.  My birth experience was wonderful!! I can't recommend her enough! "
4012,40709,0.0," Dr. Irland is a wonderful OB/GYN that is knowledgeable, compassionate, personable and always reaching for the best treatment, delivery and personalized options for you. She treats you as the center of her attention &amp; never makes you feel anything less than a special patient. She is progressive in her treatment &amp; always willing to put the patient/'s wishes first. She was an incredible active element in my prenatal care as well as during my entire 12 hour labor. I will follow her anywhere and see her even though she is outside my insurance coverage. She specializes in a natural approach to birthing with Hypnosis for Labor &amp; Delivery and has a supportive staff working with her. Even if natural birth isn/'t what you want, she is supportive &amp; caring to your needs &amp; will never deny a patient/'s personal beliefs. This doctor is definately someone to check out, once you meet with her I know you/'ll want her to be your OB/GYN too. "

4017,40724,1.0," This doctor was good for a while, I saw him for around two years...then he cut me off of my medicine that i was physically dependent on. He had called in the prescription, then called back and cancelled it, so I went through the worst physical withdrawals in my life! Completely unempathetic, and very money orientated, just google him, many people say the same thing. "
4018,40727,1.0, Dr. Idsvoog is a good listener and willing to spend time listen to the medical problem I have. He is also very thorough in reviewing my medical history and ordering the scope my lab work. 
4019,40727,1.0," Dr. Idsvoog has literally saved my life. After reassuring me about a small complaint during a busy office visit, he called me at home at 9 o'clock that night, saying I must meet him at the hospital the next morning. A biopsy was performed. It revealed a cancer which was then successfully treated. Dr. Idsvoog had returned to my case at the end of his busy day to do further research which caused the additional intervention. I believe that many physicians would have missed this. Dr. Idsvoog is extremely hard-working and has all the skills necessary to manage his busy practice successfully. "
4020,40727,1.0," Understanding, Kind, Patient. He doesn't waste time, but if you have a question he's very thorough in his answers. He's not afraid to admit he doesn't know and will refer you to someone who does. "

4023,40745,0.0," Dr. Over-prescribed ambien and other drugs for spouse. Now spouse is a total invalid, personality changed, not same person. Lit says that ambien not recommended long term (over two weeks); going on over three years. My last blood work for Lipitor cost $1500.00!!!  Previous draw was only $300.00. No longer a patient to this doctor. She theatened to cancel my scripts last time I talked to her about re-hab for my very addicted, drug dependant now turning psychotic spouse. "
4024,40745,0.0," She has been my Doctor for over 18 years. She is very good at listeniing to her patient's concerns. She doesn't give a bunch of tests you don't need. She understands how expensive it can be for a patient to come to see her. You may, however, have to wait for a bit to get in to see her. That is a little frustrating when waiting in the waiting room, but then you know she gives each patient special attention and care. I never feel rushed once I get in to see her.  "
4025,40745,0.0, Extremely knowledgable and up to date. Listens and discusses in depth 
4026,40747,2.0," Great Doctor, Was my doctor for both of my children. "
4027,40747,2.0,  
4028,40765,1.0,  
4029,40765,1.0," Non-thorough, treated me as if I were making a motorcycle accident up for attention.  Told me my thighs were visibly different sizes (I measured, they are not) and wrote half my symptoms off without addressing them.  Additionally his staff seems to not care for him, after meeting him, I can understand why.  Very pompous. DO NOT RECOMMEND!  Visiting him was a waste of both time and money besides leaving me in tears. "
4030,40766,1.0, best dr ever dr ismaili is so nice he finshed my apomtent so short i hope you like him 
4031,40766,1.0," I agree with the other comment. My father was critically ill at South Shore Medical, and Dr. Ismaili was the house doctor.  It was 24 hours before he saw my dad or myself--and then when I questioned why his neurologist was not involved in his care, instead of updating me with his condition, he told me he would put a feeding tube in my dad and I could take him home in 3 days---AND HE WALKED OUT OF THE ROOM.  He did not give me full informed consent when he explained what a &quot;comfort pack&quot; was--which is basically hospice care, which was contrary to his neurologist's orders.  It was a nightmare experience--Dr. Ismaili basically made decisions without consulting me..did not explain my father's condition...spent minimal time in the room, and I believe wrote my dad off from Day l.  "
4032,40766,1.0, Doesn't proacitively take action for serious medical care at a nuring home where he is the medical director in Milw. WI. Family members have to point our concers before matters are taken seriously. Delays in proper medical treatment have caused bigger issues to arise which caused more pain/disconfort for his patients as well as making hospital stays longer along with increase costs for care. One postitive note is he is friendly but some how that just doesn't cut it. 
4033,40768,0.0,"Dr. Jensen is such a nice man, with such an unassuming, friendly bedside manner and lovely rapport with children it's easy to forget he's a brilliant surgeon.  He operated on my daughter's very disfiguring hemangioma on her face, redoing an entire lip.  His work is extraordinary, and he gave my little girl back her pretty little face that was hidden by the ugly growth.  "
4034,40769,0.0,I absolutely loved her and I hate dentists.  Would rather have a baby(I'm 55). She is sweet and kind.  Works fast and puts her patient's welfare first. She understands the financial burdens and always lays out all the options for you so you can decide what is best and what correlate that with what you can afford but she is never pushy.  I truly miss her since she changed clinics.  
4035,40770,1.0,I've been going to Dr. Johnson's for at least 15 years. Whether I see him or another doctor in the office I've always been very satisfied with the care I've received at Elmbrook Internal Medicine.  
4036,40770,1.0,He has been my doctor for 17 years with outstanding service.  
4037,40771,1.0,"what a wonderful, caring, knowledgeable physician i have ever had the chance to meet! He may not always be on time but he sure is worth the wait because he gives his patients his full attention and really listens to what they have to say.  I have nothing but praise for this wonderful human being! "
4038,40772,1.0,"He is very arrogant, and drinks alot.  He acts like is better then others and interupts, nurse cannot even stand him. He is old and needs to retire.  "
4039,40772,1.0,Dr. Johnson is very knowledgable and genuinely concerned with the patients health. He is very good with patients. I have seen him for years and he is one of the best doctors I have visited. 
4040,40773,0.0,She is a wonderful dr. She produced amazing results with my child.  
4041,40773,0.0, 
4042,40774,1.0,"Dr. Johnson is great!  Very knowledgable, thoughtful, and motivated.  If he does not personally know the medical problem you are facing he will investigate, probe and correspond with other doctors until he gets to the root of the matter.  I highly recommend him.   His staff is great, the nurses and nurse practitioners treat you as a person not a number! "
4043,40774,1.0,A great doctor who knew what he was talking about and came in promptly. Not much waiting. Good answers to questions without hesitation. Well aware and knowledgable of what he does. 
4044,40774,1.0, 
4045,40775,1.0,"His ad says he helps people who have severe pain. Horrible waste of time and money,rude,arrogant. "
4046,40775,1.0,. Excellent care 
4047,40776,0.0,Wow.  I am NOT impressed with Dr. Jamison.  She has a real attitude problem and she is not very helpful.  She appears to be totally uninterested in finding a solution or trying anything different then the first thing or two she suggests (if you have a problem with anything she suggests then it's just over between you and her - she is done with you and tells you that you just have to live with it).  Wow.  
4048,40776,0.0,"She has been late for every appointment I have made, makes me wait (one time for several hours).  She does not appear to want to consider any other options that the patient brings to her.  She offers no solutions, only theories and sends you on your merry way.  Her staff is worthless other then to schedule an appointment.  They will do NOTHING without the doctors authorization, but they also keep saying that she is too busy to talk with anyone.  I've had to call about my lab work, they do not call me unless I call first.  Then they offer no real solutions and I continue to suffer.  I guess I am just not a priority.  This is frustrating.  "
4049,40777,1.0,"Dr. Scott Johnson has been my son's pediatrician for the past 4+ years. My son is now 18 years old, thus the necessity to find an 'adult' doctor for him (unfortunately, as Dr. Johnson is a pediatrician and does not treat adults). I have nothing but EXCELLENT things to state about Dr. Johnson. He has always been caring, knowledgeable, compassionate, and truly L-I-S-T-E-N-S to his patients. He talks 'with you' not 'at you'. Any concerns or questions you may have, he will stop and explain everything to you. He has never been condescending, arrogant, nor egotistical. His first order of business is his patient and their well-being. He is courteous, has an excellent bedside manner, funny, and very intuitive to his patients needs, well-being, and course of treatment. While others have stated &quot;you're just the mom&quot; - Dr. Johnson states &quot;you are the mom and you know more about your child than anyone.&quot; (Thank you, Dr.  Johnson, for all you do for ALL the children you treat!) HIGHLY RECOMMEND!! "
4050,40777,1.0,"Dr. Johnson has been our pediatrician for the last 4 1/2 years. He is very gentle and relaxed with my kids.  He always makes sure my questions are answered, and he is very reassuring and understanding.  I would definitely recommend Dr. Johnson to others.  "
4051,40778,0.0,She was very generous meeting with my family and was available &quot;after hours&quot; to talk to my siblings. 
4052,40779,0.0,"Dr. Janik is an extremely knowledgeable, caring, capable doctor.  She treated my advanced endometriosis and returned me to a quality of life I thought I had lost.  Other doctors, who were not specialists in this area, told me I would have to live with my pain and other symptoms.  Dr. Janik was informative, thorough, and patient.  She is also very up-to-date in treatment options and competency. "
4053,40779,0.0,"We started seeing Dr Janik after being told multiple times that IVF was our only hope. We too waited a little while to see her and YES she is very to the point, no sugar coating anything. I actually liked this about her as we had a plan of action written down within 20 minutes and future appt scheduled shortly after. We were so happy to have been able to conceive at VERY little cost and now have a happy,healthy little boy! Dr.  Janik may not have the greatest bedside manner but if you keep your eye on the goal, she is definitely the one to get you there! "
4054,40779,0.0,"We started seeing Dr. Janik earlier this year for our infertility issues/IVF.  At our first appt, she kept us waiting for about an hour for our first consult. She wasn't exactly warm &amp; friendly at first, but she warmed up after about 20-30 minutes.  She seemed very burned out/exhausted, but at the same time, very knowledgeable.  Her staff is great, with the exception of one of the front desk women who is very cold and is constantly making mistakes (such as forgetting to schedule certain appts for various tests/bloodwork).  The nurse practitioner is also pretty cold. You would think since they are dealing with couples who are experiencing infertility that they would show a bit more compassion.  The rest of the staff is EXCELLENT, which is why I continue to see Dr. Janik, along with Dr. Janik's knowledge &amp; success with IVF.  It would also be nice if they would update their website to show more current success ratios.  We are still in the early stages of our treatment.  "
4055,40779,0.0,Wow!  She is pretty rude to say the least.  I think she is burnt out and seems rushed.  At least pretend to care about the fact we want a baby. 
4056,40779,0.0,"Dr. Janik did not rush me at all.  I did wait an hour to see her, but it was worth it.  Her nurse practitioner and all staff members are very sweet.  I am a new patient so I don't know what the outcome will be, but so far I am having a good experience.  "
4057,40779,0.0,"I found Dr. Janik to be the best in her field.  She is skilled, knowledgeable and pragmatic.  I saw another fertility MD in the Milwaukee area who advised my husband and I to immediately do in vitro (after we had already had a baby accidentally on our honeymoon!)  Janik considered several issues that the other doctor saw as irrelevant.  She solved our problem with minimal financial outlay and lost time.  She has at times kept me (us) waiting for quite some time but in the end I feel she resolved our issue with a strategic, pragmatic approach.  Lastly, I found her beside manner to be warm and compassionate; if she was ever rushed or condescending it was lost on me. "
4058,40779,0.0,Dr. Janik and her staff were very knowledgeable and helpful.  She was the fourth infertility Dr. that we consulted and she was by far the best.  She was able to look beyond the basics and see what the others could not.  She was very caring and truly passionate about her work.   I would highly recommend! 
4059,40779,0.0,"Dr. Janik lacks the bedside manner needed to treat couples facing infertility. She is abrupt, condescending, and at times down right rude. Her specialty appears to be laparoscopic surgery and once she has exhausted all surgical options, she essential gives up on the patient. Since leaving Dr. Janik's care, I have subsequently received care from compassionate, highly trained and extremely specialized fertility specialist who were able to diagnose a problem Dr. Janik never even considered. "
4060,40779,0.0, 
4061,40780,2.0,Excellent Doc. Performed lap assisted hyst and was awesome.  
4062,40781,2.0, 
4063,40782,1.0,I actually have a pleasant experience when I go to him.  He doesn't sugarcoat his diagnosis.  He tells you how it is and what needs to be done to correct the issue.  If he doesn't have the expertiese he will refer you to someone. 
4064,40782,1.0,"My daughter went to his urgent care after being treated for a bladder infection them having bad back pains. NO tests given, told her her back hurt because she was pregnant. Two days later she was in ER and was admitted for severe kidney infection. Had high fever which put baby at risk. He was told she was prone to kidney infections also! On the other hand he is very pleasant. But have been told by his own staff that HE DOESN'T LISTEN!! "
4065,40782,1.0,I went to him with severe pain in my foot.  I told him I had an infection.   He looked at it and said it was not an infection.  He gave me pain pills and sent me home.  Within 48 hours of that visit I was in the hospital with cellulitis.   I wouldn't trust his diagnosis of anything.  
4066,40782,1.0,"This doctor was terrible in treating me at the urgent care where he works. I had bladder infection, he gave me a prescription for antibotics and told me when I felt better I could stop taking the medicine I couldn't believe he said that because everyone knows that anitbotics need to be taken until gone, I asked him why he would tell me this and he just laughed. I was not impressed with him at all and will NOT be seeing him again.  "
4067,40783,0.0,"I saw Dr. Johnson because my dr at the same clinic was out for a few days.  I was quite ill with what was diagnosed as bronchitis.  I waited over 1/2 just to see the doctor. Even tho she couldn't hear any sign of pneumonia, she sent me for a chest x-ray.  An hour and a half into my appointment I finally was sent home, totally weak and miserable.  On the way out she asked &quot;are you alright&quot;. Obviously not.  I became more ill from the z-pack she prescribed.  When my regular doctor returned, I was correctly diagnosed with the influenza virus and treated quickly with a course of prednisone.  I will not go back to see Dr. Johnson and would not recommend her to anyone. "
4068,40783,0.0,"This is the doctor I've wanted to find for years. She listens.  She considers carefully. It's like she has a sixth sense for all of my symptoms (chronic diseases) and how they affect my daily life before I even voice them. She seems to have a broad and deep experience with medicine - enough to even surpass a few specialists I'd tried prior to seeing her. I could not put together a better physician than this - she's just fantastic. She also considers carefully my needs when she's working up a treatment plan with me - she doesn't simply TELL you one solution, she talks it over with you and makes sure the solution will work for you. This doc REALLY cares about people. Her nurse is really good, too. All the staff are pleasant. They get me in quickly and never make me wait. They call back promptly, too.  Oh - and she's well versed on what stress can do to a person's health.  "
4069,40784,2.0,"excellent, took time to answer my questions and releave my anxiety about anesthesia. "
4070,40785,1.0,"Dr. Jamil was terrific!  I had seen two other doctors over the years for my chronic pain and neither came close to showing the compassion and care that Dr. Jamil did.  He tried several different solutions for my pain and finally got me on a regimen that allows me to live my life.  He was easy to talk to and was very approachable.  On one occasion I had to have him paged on a Sunday.  He called me almost immediately and was very helpful with my urgent issue.  Now that he has left NSG, I will miss him a great deal!  I will always appreciate the thorough and compassionate treatment he provided.  Thanks, Dr.  Jamil!! :-) "
4071,40785,1.0,I was extremely pleased with Dr. Jamil.  He has allowed me to be back and hip pain free for a year now.  I would recommend him to everyone!!!  Thanks so much Dr.  Jamil! 
4072,40785,1.0,"Stay away!!! I received a wrong diagnosis and when I questioned him he told me he didn't care if I was treated or not.  When I asked questions he said he didn't know to every one of them.  In the end he wanted to treat me for something I didn't even have just to see if it would work.  He made it quite clear that he didn't care about my health. From his unkept appearance, I could tell he didn't care much about himself either.  "
4073,40786,2.0,I've been seeing Dr. Jensen for close to 10 years now.  I've never had a dentist or dental staff that performs such a thorough and excellent examination.  
4074,40787,1.0,This guy should retire.  No clue what he is doing.  He would have let me die.  Had to take matters into my own hands. 
4075,40789,1.0,"My insurance was not an option to choose; however, I used insurance.  Dr. Johnson and his staff are so professional yet personable and courteous.  We tried two other dentist when we moved here and I'm so thankful we finally found the right one!  We are very happy with his office. "
4076,40789,1.0,"I've been to Dr. Johnson twice now, once for an x-ray and the other for a root canal. He was very generous giving me free x-rays and doing a root canal for only $1000, which is very cheap! He was cautious not to cause pain and did it in a timely fashion. I recommend Dr. Johnson any day. "
4077,40789,1.0,I have been treated by Dr. Johnson for several years now.  He is very helpful with teaching you about your dental needs.  Very kind and caring dentist. 
4078,40789,1.0,Very kind doctor and also very knowledgable.  Took his time to make my visit very comfortable.  Professional and courteous staff.  I will be going here for life. 
4079,40790,2.0,Missed a payment at Christmas and was turned over to collection agency without warning. 
4080,40791,1.0,This doctor is the most amazing physician I could ever have imagined having.  
4081,40791,1.0,.  
4082,40791,1.0,"He is somewhat quiet but it's just because he is so thourough. His NPs and nurses ake the most amazing care of you and answer any questions you may have. I've seen other docs in his practice and they have all told me how lucky I am to have him as a doctor. Even my pediatrician see him. After a complicated pregnancy and delivery a nurse at the hospital told me if I would have had any other doctor I probably wouldn't have my son. As a matter of fact I'm at the end of another complicated pregnancy and I will be seeing him tomorrow for an amnio and as scared as I am, I trust him fully. I can't say enough about how intelligent this man is.  "
4083,40791,1.0,"He was very short with me and did not take the time to explain anything.  His nurse was the one that had to explain the findings of the ultrasound, he actually told the nurse I had to get dressed and out of the room so he could see his next patient.  During the ultrasound he did not explain what he was looking at or what he was measuring, I was more concerned and confused after seeing him then prior to going to my appointment.  "
4084,40791,1.0,"He helped deliver two of my babies, and I trust him and his staff (esp. his two nurse practitioners) with  our lives. He is a high risk OBGYN, and truely cares about his patients and their babies. When you walk in they not only know their patients by their names, but also their history.  They are like an extended family:) "
4085,40792,2.0,"Dr. Jaradeh is a very caring and compassionate doctor.  When no one else could help with my daughter's CIDP, Dr. Jaradeh came up with solutions.  "
4086,40792,2.0,kept going in and out during office visit.   Seemed more self-involved than patient oriented 
4087,40793,2.0,Dr. Johnson is an outstanding doctor!! 
4088,40794,0.0,"dr mark is a wonderful dr with a great personality.i like him very much,he's a good dr.my mother who has seen him for 4 years loves her and he really likes her,great job dr mark.ty dr mark is a caring special dr.  "
4089,40794,0.0,"An outstanding, candid and compassionate care giver. He's been my doctor for over 10 years, he not only treats the body but also treats the mind with straight answers and humor and he listens! I trust him with my health and more importantly the health of my family, I wouldn't want to be treated by anyone else. "
4090,40795,1.0,Was very rude and did not follow a standard of care. Told me to run along after a very short visit. I am currently on Chemo-therapy and was treated terrible.  
4091,40795,1.0,"Dr. Jones is a good doctor, but relies heavly on the internet and his PDA for drug related questions, and some medical concerns. He is very caring when it comes to most medical concerns. He was very thorough when researching my fertility problem and helping me find another dr to resolve the situation. "
4092,40796,0.0,"I love Dr Jeranek's,  she is such a nice and caring chiropractor.  My results have been wonderful and I love going there.  The office is very warm and inviting. I would highly recommend. "
4093,40797,2.0,.  
4094,40798,1.0,"Very arrogant. would not listen to my concerns and from the get go was an ass, I strongly felt like he thought I was lying by the accusatory things he would say. And when he found out I was getting a second opinion he completely flipped out and was yelling at me about and claimed he was the best Doctor in the lans and should not have another doctor look at me. Avoid at all costs "
4095,40798,1.0,"WORST MD I EVER! I am an RN.  No bedside manners, if you ever see him more than 10 minutes.  Very arrogant.  Would not let me ask a single question about family members health.  Ignored the sympotoms my loved one was experienceing and then blamed me and my family for causing my loved one's symptoms.  We were told to DEAL WITH IT!!  I would not ever recommend him to any one.  I don't believe he is still practicing medicine because he shouldn't be! "
4096,40798,1.0,This is by far the worst doctor I have ever went to.  He accused me of making everything up after he had diagnosed me with a disease.  Then he told me to hurry up with my questions because he had other patients to see and I only would have 15 minutes.  I was sitting there crying because of his rudeness and meanness towards me.  He was not very knowledgeable and ran down other drs in the area as well as Mayo Clinic.  Do not see him if you don't have to.  
4097,40798,1.0,"by far the worst Dr I've ever seen, and his staff was even worse. I was accused of dr shopping, being an addict, abusing drugs, and even had the nurse hang up the phone on me mid-sentence. After over 2 years, the symptoms have not only failed to improve, but have gotten worse. He even told me straight out there was nothing more he could do for me other than keep writing scripts for an opoid pain reliever, then, within a month, threatened to stop writing scripts. After one script was stolen while I was out of state, his office refused to refill for another 2 months.     I wouldn't recommend Dr Jaffri to my worst enemy. How this man is still allowed to practice medicine amazes me. "
4098,40798,1.0,"we found him very arrogant, and would not listen to family questions and  information. This failure lead to significant negative effects for the patient. He failed to listen to patient, family and the medical records,leading to the amnesic loss of five days out of her life. "
4099,40799,0.0,"I see Dr. Jahnke at the Aurora Clinic in West Bend, WI. She's been my doctor for over 10 years and cannot say enough good things about her. She's caring and friendly and doesn't give up in her search for answers. She respects my feelings and never lectures, and discusses any treatments or procedures she recommends with me. "
4100,40800,2.0,"Very nice doctor, had no issues and worked with me nicely. "
4101,40801,2.0,Best rheumatologist I have ever had. I have a very rare auto immune disease &amp; Dr. J is one of the only Dr.'s who would even consider taking my case.  
4102,40801,2.0,Not very helpful when desling with pseudogout.   Many appointments with no treatment 
4103,40801,2.0,this doctor has not been very helpful in the area of expertise when it comes to managing lupus symptoms or treatments.  i am very dissatisfied with the level of care.  
4104,40802,1.0,Does not return phone calls promptly. I called on a Thursday afternoon. He didn't return my call until Monday night. That is unacceptable. He also lacks personality.  
4105,40802,1.0,"very knowledgable, asks a lot of questions.  Needs to exhibit a little more personality though. "
4106,40802,1.0,Pretty good doctor. Soemtiems doesn't follow thru. 
4107,40803,1.0,Dr Jereb is excellent...   He has been the doctor for both our sons for over 5 years and is excellent with the kids and parents.  I'd recommend him to anyone that is looking for a good ped.  
4108,40803,1.0,I love Dr Jereb! He has been my daughters pediatrician for over 6 years.  He is great! 
4109,40804,1.0,Great Dr to have on your team.  I am a breast cancer patient and Dr Janitch is awesome to work with.  He also went above and beyond what I expected.  Good work on reconstruction surgery.  The staff was also very friendly and understanding. 
4110,40804,1.0,Dr. Janitch did the reconstruction surgery after my bilateral mastectomies.  I could not decide which size implants to go with.  I had Dr. Janitch choose the size based on my body frame. They turned out perfect! Dr. Janitch is the nicest doctor I have ever had and truly cares about making sure you are totally satisfied with your results.  His nurses Jackie and Meagan were also wonderful.  He did an excellent job on the reconstruction of my breasts and they look amazing! Dr. Janitch is the best!!! 
4111,40804,1.0,After doing research and waiting several years we chose Dr. Janitch to do Otoplasty surgery on my daughter. My daughter spent several years getting teased by her peers for the appearance of her ears. Dr. Janitch changed all that for her. They turned out great! My daughter is so happy and confident now! Thank you so much Dr. Janitch!! :) 
4112,40804,1.0,Dr. Janitch is a very caring and knowledgeable doctor. He made me feel very comfortable as to what I wanted to have done. The results are excellent and I now have the flat stomach that I have wanted for so many years. It was well worth the surgery and recovery time. 
4113,40804,1.0,"I am very happy with Dr Janitch and his staff, Jackie and Megan.  Everyone was very helpful and answered all of mine and my husband's questions.  I am very pleased with my abdominoplasty. Dr Janitch did a great job.  No more flabby belly, the scar looks great and my slacks fit much better.  Thanks Dr Janitch!  You are the best. "
4114,40804,1.0,"I had a breast lift as well as small implants and they turned out just beautiful!  I am not a very large person and I didn't want huge breasts so I left it up to Dr. Janitch to implant the size he thought I would be most satisfied with.  Without a doubt, he made the right choice for me and I made the right choice as a surgeon.  His staff are so welcoming and friendly and the office is top of the line as far as cleanliness.  I highly recommend Dr. Janitch. (I have also seen a tummy tuck on a client of his; she looks fabulous!) So...............I say see Dr. Janitch for any surgery you might be thinking about.........He's definitely the best! "
4115,40804,1.0,Dr. Janitch and staff were awesome! I had breast augmentation 3 months ago &amp; am extremely happy with my results. They exceded my expectations.  Dr. and his staff are very professional and always made me feel comfortable. I was explained all my options and glad I went with his professional recomendation. I feel that I made the right choice by going to him.  THANKS DR. JANITCH! 
4116,40804,1.0,"Dr.Janitch is the doctor my husband and I chose for my breast implants surgery.I met many other doctors and did a year of research.I had a hard time picking any of the other doctors I met.I asked my ob gyn doctor for a recommendation.He gave me Dr.Janitch.When I met Dr.Janitch and the staff,I knew I was not going to find better care.Theres nothing that could have been made better from day one.He operated at Saint Marys hospital,which was also amazing.Thanks to the excellent job he did in surgery,I had only minor discomfort for a few days.I only wish I would have done this years ago because of the happiness I gained from it.I absolutely recommend Dr.Janitch and the staff if you are trying to decide.I had many questions and he answered every one of them when I asked in the office.His nurse was always there when I called with questions.Easy making appointments with very little wait time.All the way through,it was a pleasant experience. :) "
4117,40804,1.0,"I recently had Dr. Janitch perform a mini tummy tuck on me. Two weeks out and I already look great. Dr. Janitch and his nurse Jackie make a great team. Dr. Janitch is exactly what you want in a surgeon: confident, capable, and considerate. Add to that Jackie's cool calm and her willingness to answer endless questions and you have a dynamic duo. I am happy I went to Dr. Janitch for my procedure and I recommend him to anyone. "
4118,40804,1.0,"Dr. Janitch performed by B.A. about a month ago and although it is still early, so far so good!  Never having surgery before I was a little nervous, but his reputation and confidence made me feel very safe and in good hands.  I found his staff, both at Prevea Plastic Surgery and at St. Mary's to be wonderful in every way. I recommend him not only for his knowledge and skill, but also for his honest and professional opinion.  I will return to Dr. J for my next surgery or if I choose to have any other procedures done:) "
4119,40804,1.0,Dr. Janitch did my Tummy Tuck and Breast Augmentation.  I interiviewed several other surgeons in the area and felt he and his staff were most knowledgeable and helpful.  I couldn't be more pleased :)Thanks 
4120,40804,1.0,"He did my abdominoplasty and breast augmentation, most professional and skilled, I couldn't be happier!!:) "
4121,40804,1.0,I really liked Dr. Janitch.  He looked after my boyfriend when he burnt his self trying to cook.  Dr. J was very informative and caring.  he even called to make sure my b.f. wasn't working too much.  Lots Of Caring Staff!!! 
4122,40804,1.0, 
4123,40804,1.0,Dr. Janitch did my breast lift/implants.  My scars are hideous at best and the implants are not in the correct position.  When I asked him to repair the bubble left under one of my breasts I was charged a ridiculous amount. I went to a different doctor to have the entire job done over and now all is great but basically I had to pay twice for the surgery as Dr. Janitch did such an awful job. I regretted having Dr. Janitch do my surgery every day. 
4124,40805,1.0,"This doctor mis-diagnosed my condition. He offered very little direction or treatment, ordered no tests. He was rude and unsympathetic. He spoke to his resident when he examined me rather than speaking to me directly. I felt degraded and disrespected. I left his office crying. "
4125,40805,1.0,"No, I mean NO bedside manner.  Had me crying in my husbands arms with his harsh replies to my fertility concerns.  I could never treat someone as he treated me.  When looking for advise and expertise I found textbook answers and no guidance or help for my situation of cysts and endometriosis.  All he could offer me was, &quot;Well then you need to try another type of birth control pill.&quot; (I had tried 4 different doses & brands) and &quot;The pain is in your head, you should seek pain management help.&quot;                                              I hope you can avoid being treated by this soul less person. "
4126,40805,1.0,"Unusual personality but is up to date, knowledgable, helpful, explains options well. "
4127,40806,2.0,Femoral nerve damage from surgery with a 3 month to 1 year recovery.  
4128,40806,2.0,vary caring doctor 
4129,40808,2.0,Poor bedside manner. Did not communicate effectively.  Could be more professional.  
4130,40809,2.0,Dr Jaglan is awesome. Takes the time to explain everything and is very kind and gentle. 
4131,40810,0.0,Dr. Kris is extremly warm and caring and it comes through in the care she gives her patients. I can't imagine anyone not loving this lady for their doctor - unless they have their own mind made up about what they want to hear from their doctor before going in and Dr. Kris doesn't tell them exactly what THEY wanted to hear. 
4132,40810,0.0,"I liked her the first visit, thought she seemed terrific. But boy, did I see another side of her!  I wanted to talk to her about holistic medicine, and she wanted nothing to do with me after that.  I think she's a terrible doctor.  So closed minded. Terrible.  "
4133,40810,0.0,"Awesome!  I switched because I felt my previous doctor wasn't &quot;getting it&quot;...wasn't listening to my concerns.  By the time I met Dr. Juntunen, I had quite a few of them, but she took the time to handle each of them in one visit.  I was very happy.  "
4134,40810,0.0,. I feel Doctor was brisky with me and offered no favorable outcomes 
4135,40810,0.0,"Very impressive doctor.  The best I've come across in a long time.   No ego problem, listens and will work with you,  Plus is warm, good sense of humor, and easy to talk to,  Very smart and very capable,  I am thrilled to have found her, "
4136,40811,0.0,Beth was intuitive and extremely helpful with my issues.  She was a sympathetic listener and offered constructive suggestions that helped my situation when I thought no one else could understand.  I highly recommend her.  
4137,40812,0.0,"Absolutely wonderful! From start to finish! Great attitude, care, professionalism, and team work through out the entire staff. "
4138,40812,0.0,Getting LASIK surgery done was the best decision I have ever made.  I am free of glasses and my quality of life is so much better.  The world looks amazing through my new eyes.  The procedure was easy and Dr. Jay and her staff are amazing.  The really took care of me! I would recommend LASIK with Dr. Jay to everyone.  Worth every penny!! 
4139,40813,1.0,I have never trusted a doctor until I met Dr J.  I am not afraid to tell him a thing because he has been in the shoes of a patient - typically doctors just read on addiction and think you have to follow an order or you MUST do this and this if you want to remain sober.  Thank God I have years of sobriety (now) but the path would have been so much better if Dr J was my doc at the onset.  So smart about everything! He even helped when a medicine caused a dental issue.  He knew what would help and it did.  He is out of pocket for my insurance but well worth the cost.  Nancy - his wife - runs the office and is beyond friendly.  She always greets you by name - that means a lot.  
4140,40813,1.0,"This doctor really screwed me over. The story is too long and bizarre to write in such short space. Basically we had problems, I felt we were doing work, he was disapointed I wasn't his &quot;superpatient&quot;  he was mean and cut me off of treatment with little to no warning leaving me in a terrible place. "
4141,40813,1.0,"I spent more than 2 years seeing Dr. Junig and can say without reservation that he is the best physician I have ever had the pleasure of having care for me. I found Dr. Junig to be very knowledgeable, friendly, caring, thorough, understanding, and overall extremely helpful in whatever capacity I was seeing him for. In short, if Dr. Junig offers services that you need for your continued good health, I recommend as strongly as I can that you see him; you won't be sorry! "
4142,40814,2.0,"Dr. Jhansale takes the time to explain things and provides options, unlike many other doctors I had.  "
4143,40815,1.0,"I feel I found a good doctor, good eye contact, nice bedside manners. Answered all of my questions and most of all he was on time.  "
4144,40816,0.0,Dr jones is a very good doctor. She was very patient and keen on every word i was saying.  She called me at home.  And that really impressed me. Great Doctor. 
4145,40816,0.0,Great Doctor!!!  Listens and talks in understandable terms.  I really feel at ease with her. 
4146,40816,0.0,Excellent. Very attentive and easy to talk to. Love her! 
4147,40816,0.0,Dr. Jones seemed very knowlegeable and friendly. She seemed truely interested in me and willing to listen to my concerns.  
4148,40816,0.0, 
4149,40817,1.0,"I initially discovered Dr. Jin and his clinic first in the phonebook back in 2009 while me and my husband were trying for our 1st baby to no avail, we then decided to ask around our circle of friends (who are always health conscious) as to their recommendation of an acupuncturist in the area who specializes in infertility treatment (as you'll soon find out there are many), and to my surprise, all of my responses were Dr. Jin and Ace Acupuncture to be my  best bet, so that was the easiest decision I've ever made. 3 months later, we achieved the impossible, our oldest son (Joakim - now 2) was conceived! We attribute our success to Dr. Jin and for my friends who referred him to us! "
4150,40818,2.0,"Make recommendations for four fillings for a child that were entirely unneeded.  Injured me, the adult patient, during my fillings.  Refused to acknowledge any wrongdoing.  "
4151,40819,0.0,Also known as DR Nimrod.. Not sure about the rest of his patients but not only did he mis diagnos my mother with sinus/allergie problems but also my father... Well for having sinus/allergy problems Pnemonia fits right in!! my mom had to get rushed to the ER and have 1 1/2 liters of fluid drained from her right lung and was in the hospital almost a week!! way to go Dr NIMROD!! thank god my parents lived !! 
4152,40820,1.0,Very knowledgeable and empathetic.  I trust him completely! 
4153,40820,1.0,"My wife and I have used Dr. Greg Johnson for years based on the many recommendations of others.  We have found him to be an exceptional doctor.  He is very bright, knowledgeable, caring and talented.  When we are with him we find him very focused on us as patients.  He gives wonderful advice, is concerned about our wellness and even worries about the economics of health care.  We couldn't be more pleased with him as our family doctor. "
4154,40820,1.0,Went to walk-in with my daughter who had strep and there was a football game on- Dr. Johnson didn't know we were sitting where we could hear him. He said we could sit there until halftime! Staff at clinic are just down right rude. I changed doctor and clinic. I wouldn't take my dog to that place.  
4155,40821,1.0,Dr. Ross is the best chiropractor I have seen.  He spends time each visit to listen to and care for my concerns and chiropractic needs.  His adjustments are great and his bedside manner is fantastic. I highly recommend Dr. Ross Jensen.  
4156,40822,2.0,Competent and caring but difficult to schedule appts. I called on a Monday to reschedule a Thursday appointment because my work schedule changed. They sent me a bill for a &quot;missed&quot; appt and told me that I could get in again for 7 months. I changed to Brian Fick 
4157,40823,1.0,Dr. Jasek is very friendly and caring.  I had to have my left knee drained twice last winter and his concern and expertize was very comforting throughout the treatment.  I suffer with RA and he has been my rhuematologist for @ 5 years.  I always feel very much and ease and in good hands with Dr. Jasek!!! 
4158,40823,1.0,"It takes awhile for this Dr. to warm up to you, but well worth the wait. He is extremly knowledgable and is tenacious on finding the correct diagnosis. I am very happy to have him as my Dr.  and his nurse Terri is a gem! "
4159,40823,1.0,"I have an appointment to see a new Rheumatologist tomorrow.  Dr. Jasek's bedside manner is very cold and apathetic .  I have seen him twice and both times he told me that I have a &quot;connective tissue disease&quot;  He ran some test put me on some meds and told me to come back in 4 months.  I have called his office 3 times, and emailed twice. 4 times his nurse responded for him and the last no response at all.  He seems as though he cannot be bothered, and has no time for me.  Worst doctor I have ever been to.  "
4160,40823,1.0,This doctor has always been very kind and patient with me.  He gives me adequate time to ask questions and explains everything.   I had a different rheumatologist at one time and he was horrid.   This one is a gem.  
4161,40823,1.0,Bedside manner is HORRIBLE!!  He is very abrupt and seems in a big hurry to get out of the room to the next patient.. perhaps overbooked&#63;  I never was able to get all my questions in before he was out the door.  His nurse is really great though.  
4162,40824,1.0,"Dr. Johnson was our dentist for several years, until we moved away from La Crosse. We never had any trouble with him or his staff. Dental work was always fine. He was very gentle. "
4163,40824,1.0,Everything that he did now has to be re-done by another dentsit. Everyone in our family now has problems due to work that he did. He is very unprofessional and does not know what he is doing. He is also very rough when working on you. 
4164,40825,2.0,We came in to have my daughters glasses adjusted.  The frames were hard to work with and they accidentally scratched the lens.  They told us they would replace the glasses and the frames.  So nice to have a company that stands behind their products! 
4165,40826,0.0,Dr. Johannes was gentle and pleasant as she did a complete exam and staff was accomodating to schedule exam & cleaning at the same time.   As a new patient I was extremely satisfied! 
4166,40827,1.0,"I was extremely disappointed in Dr. Jacoby's attitude towards me, he was very dismissive and made my condition worse instead of better. Maybe it has to do with medicare people or old people in general, that he has no empathy. Maybe it is not entirely his fault that they jam 15 people into the same time slot and somebody had to get left behind, it may as well be the old guy. I have a lifetime of back injuries because I used to be a brick layer for a construction company, and I went to Jacoby because I lost all feeling in both my hands from various surgeries over the years to my lower back and hip replacements. He treated me like it was my fault that my body is going to hell at 59. I don't think they should allow doctors to practice pain therapy who have never experienced chronic pain themselves. It was a total waste of the taxpayers dollars, he obviously never did a day's work in his life. I don't expect him to work miracles anymore, but he could at least have shown some compassion.  "
4167,40828,2.0,.  
4168,40829,1.0,"I have seen Dr. Johnston for almost 16 years and he is by far the most attentive, patient, caring doctor I have ever meet. He is the only doctor I have ever truly felt comfortable with and at ease telling him anything! Absolutly the best! Wish more doctors were like this kind, gentle, and caring man! Some should take lessons from him.  And most importantly, he is a very knowledgable and thorough physician! "
4169,40829,1.0,"Very nice, was my primary for several years. I am still unable to find a quality, patient, caring doctor like him.  "
4170,40830,1.0,"My father died on April 14, 2010 as a result of the surgery that Dr. Matthew Johnson performed. During a routine laproscopic gall bladder surgery Dr. Johnson clipped the common bile duct in error.  He never requested a follow-up visit for my father which was odd given that he was 79 years old.  After several procedures performed by other doctors and several hospital stays there was nothing they could do to repair the error. This situation involved poor care which we have outlined for the health care provider to no avail.  I would not recommend this doctor.  "
4171,40830,1.0,"My husband died as a result of an incompletely done and rushed surgery. Also, the hospital where the surgery was performed did not have the facilities to help my husband after he was in trouble. The doctor was aware of that and should have informed us. The doctor also did not follow up with him after he was in trouble. "
4172,40831,2.0,Very knowledgeable @ congenial.  Doctor to 2 of my family members.  Well liked.  
4173,40832,1.0,"Worst experience I have had with any doctor, anywhere, in thirty years!  Why this man became a doctor, is beyond me.  He is so cold, no real caring or empathy.  Offered me no help, no suggestions, was a complete waste of time and frankly, very upsetting.    And very little knowledge.  I wish someone had warned me about him.   What a terrible experience! "
4174,40833,0.0,This is the second time this doctor has sent me home in pain without doing anything for me. Terrible.  
4175,40833,0.0,"Very rude dr, doesn't want to really help people in need, assistant was great. Would not recommend this doctor. She cannot handle a patient with many different health problems and be professional about it.  "
4176,40834,0.0,"Every visit I have had with Dr Jekot has been great. She is enthusiastic and carign and answers all my concerns during the well checks. She is genuinely concerned when my kids are sick, takes time to really listen to me, and  is kind with my kids and makes them feel comfortable. She is very experienced and knowlegeable.  She has picked up on things other docs have overlooked , even though I mentioned them. This lead her to diagnose my daughter quickly when others had missed it. She is part time, but certainly worth it. "
4177,40834,0.0,"Very easily flustered &amp; confused. Very quick to jump to &quot;wait &amp; see&quot; or &quot;here, try this ... now this, now this&quot; modes &amp; when parents want a more proactive approach, she slithers from the room &amp; leaves the rest of the communication up to her nursing staff. Works less than part time so it takes forever to anything done. Good to go to for easy things (check ups, strep throat, etc.) but should something serious arise, Dr. Jekot is not one to fight for her patients or their families. "
4178,40835,0.0,Arrived for pre-op consult 10 mins late. Told Dr. had to leave to teach in another building at 12:30  Later told Dr. had to be in surgery.  Does not matter she would have only had 15 min by her schedule for an entire pre-op consult if I was on time  Ordered ultrasound at clinic and did not advise tech what to look for.  She didn't find the tumor that was to be removed and would not re do the test.  Two days later I had an ultrasound with another dr. and there was the tumor clear as day. She dismissed me and sent me home to revisit her in 2 months for a another matter.  I have cried She had my husband believing that the tumor was gone  She had my family doubting me  So disappointed as she was high;y recommended  But she could not admit or try to fix the problem  According to her there simply was no tumor and the patient was wrong.  Well I wasnt and it caused a bunch of problems and even when made aware of her mistake she did not call or try to make contact with me dr. s need to listen! 
4179,40835,0.0,Best doctor I have ever had. Period. She was amazing. 
4180,40836,0.0,"While his nursing staff, especially Jean (oy, what an evil thing she is) is a bit dense and prone to errors (I am an RN myself) Dr. Jerzak more than makes up for their follies. His front desk staff is friendly and very efficient, as is the lab staff. Dr. Jerzak himself is very busy and is not great on keeping records and diagnoses up to date, but he LISTENS and treats you like a human being, not a number. He genuinely cares. I've been seing him for over 20 years now and I can trust him to refer me to a specialist when necessary, treat me as a partner in my health care, and despite my chronic condition always treat me with respect and compassion. He is well versed and up to date on what's new in health care and is open to the information I bring him from reputable sources. He keeps an open mind.  I love him! "
4181,40836,0.0,"EXTREMELY PERSONABLE DOCTOR.  VERY EASY TO TALK TO (HE TALKS IN PLANE ENGLISH, NOT OVER YOUR HEAD LIKE SOME DOCTORS DO). HE SITS AND TAKES THE TIME TO LET YOU TALK. OCCASSIONALLY WILL BLOW OFF THINGS, BUT YOU JUST NEED TO OPEN UP TO HIM AND TELL HIM YOUR CONCERNES. IT'S A GOOD THING THEY HAVE GONE TO LAPTOPS FOR THE DOCTORS BECAUSE HIS PENMENSHIP IS HORRIBLE, so don't let him write any notes you might want to read later :)  HE'S VERY COMMICLE AND EASY GOING.  A DOCTOR I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMEND, YOU WILL LOVE HIM! I'VE BEEN HIS PATIENT FOR OVER 20 YEARS.  "
4182,40836,0.0, 
4183,40837,1.0,I've seen him 20 years. He has taken excellent care of me. He is genuinely concerned for my well being. He puts me on the meds best for me. I am more stable than ever before under his care. I have only good things to say about him. His staff is top-rate. I have no idea how he just remembers many things about each medicine. 
4184,40837,1.0,"Excellent service. Knowledgeable. Understanding. Thorough. Thoughtful. Easy to talk to. He is not only a sleep specialist, but is a practicing psychiatrist as well. The center itself looks like an upscale hotel and the staff are very helpful. Overnight sleep study room was incredibly comfortable.  "
4185,40838,2.0,"Misdiagnosed me which led to serious illness. Did not examine, run any labs or imaging, and failed to look further even when symptoms got progressively worse.  Was rude and arrogant.  "
4186,40839,1.0,I was very impressed by Dr Johnson. Took plenty of time and showed me my MRI and explained everything to me. Very knowledgeable.I felt like he really cared.  
4187,40839,1.0,"I was referred to Dr. Johnson and came in with an entire page of typed up questions to ask regarding possible surgery.  He dismissed me saying he would not recommend surgery, and therefore would not answer my questions.  He stated that if I wanted a second opinion there were plenty of other neurosurgeons to choose from. I also waited 45 minutes to see him for 10 minutes. I found him to be arrogant.  I was very disappointed.  And yes, I am seeking another opinion...  "
4188,40839,1.0,. Seems to be very honest and helpful 
4189,40840,0.0,My daughter just turned 3 and has been seeing her since she was born. Me and her both love him! Being a first time mom I always have lots of questions and he answers all of them and doesn't rush me. He even visited her when she was admitted into the hospital over night. I would highly recommend him!!! 
4190,40840,0.0,We have been going to Dr Johnson for our children the last 3 and a half years.  We actually moved from West Allis to Oak Creek 3 years ago but like him so much that we make the drive for their pediatrician visits.  He is has a comforting bedside manner with children and is both thorough and pleasant.  We wouldn't go anywhere else for quality healthcare for our children.  
4191,40840,0.0,Dr. Johnson is a great doctor. Very informative and doesn't rush you out.  Our daughter enjoy's her experiences with him.  
4192,40840,0.0,He is very patient with the kids. He treats the parents with respect and dignity. He has four kids of his own. He absolutely understands kids/teens. Highly recommend him.

4197,40844,2.0,Extremely knowledgeable and compassionate 
4198,40845,1.0,Dr. Jansen and his staff were incredible!  I had a rhinoplasty and breast augmentation. The staff was very knowledgeable and made me feel very comfortable.  I really liked how Dr. Jansen was very forward with me and didn't sugar coat anything.  He is very honest and trusting.  Thank you for doing such a great job and boosting my confidence.  I will definitely go back! 
4199,40845,1.0,"Very professional doctor and staff.  Went in for gynecomastia treatment, and the results are awesome.  I recommend Dr. Jannsen to anyone who is considering the procedure.  The staff had me well prepared before, during, and after the procedure.  My recovery time was much less than what I had researched from other doctors. "
4200,40845,1.0,I contacted Dr. Janssen's office after having had a less than satisfactory result from a rhinoplasty done by a local plastic surgeon.  I had contacted the original surgeon about a possible second surgery and was told that I looked fine and there was nothing more he could do.  I heard about Dr. Janssen from a radio ad for the Fox Valley Plastic Surgery Center. I went to the initial consultation expecting to be told that he couldn't do anything for me.  Instead Dr. Janssen started to explain what changes he could make to my nose and then took out a diagram of nasal structures to show me exactly what he would be able to do.  I was thrilled that he was willing to do something for me.  The surgery went very well and I am very happy with the result.  Dr Janssen and his entire staff were extremely courteous and professional and I have recommended them to my best friend and sister-in-law. I would not hesitate for a moment to return to Dr. Janssen for any cosmetic work in the future. 
4201,40845,1.0,"I had a nipple sparing double mastectomy 6/2010, reconstruction 11/2010 and a follow-up procedure called lipo-structure 4/2011. I am extremely pleased with the results. Dr. Janssen was wonderful throughout this entire ordeal and I would not hesitate to highly recommend him. He is a professional yet was very attentive to my needs and concerns. My husband is also very happy with the way all turned out and we have an attitude of graditude towards Dr. Janssen. We are so thankful to God for using this Doctors skill and expertise in a difficult time in my life. "
4202,40845,1.0,"Dr. Janssen wanted to make sure that I was very happy with the results after having a large portion of by breast removed while having cancer.  He did a great job, was very professional and answered all the questions that my husband and I had prior to the surgery.  After feeling like a part of me was missing I decided to have the surgery and am so very happy that I did.  Not only do I feel better about myself but I look so much better.  I am someone who is in a bathing suit all the time and believe me people noticed that there was something wrong with my breasts.  Friends are one thing but when I was around strangers I felt so embrassed.  Dr. Janssen not only fixed the large hole that was missing but also aligned my nipples and now I would beg for anyone to tell me they can tell the difference.  Dr. Janssen and his staff were just wonderful and I would recommend him to anyone who has had my problem or just needs to have something fixed.  Very professional and caring people.   The Best!!! "
4203,40845,1.0,"Over the past 14 years I have had two mastectomys and reconstruction.  Dr. Janssen's professionalism and caring manner made me feel whole.  When you go through something that tramatic it is important to have a doctor that you trust.  Dr. Jannsen, through my reconstruction, made me look even better than I expected.  I have the confidence to wear a swimsuit and partake many athletic activities.  He is a true artist of the body.  I look and feel like a woman.  I give thanks every day that I had a surgeon who made me feel like I was his only patient.  His office feels more like a business office than a Drs. office.  His staff is professional and are dressed accordingly.  I was always greeted with a smile and met punctually by the Doctor.  Even thought the situation was terrible I couldn't have had a better medical experience.  "
4204,40845,1.0,"Our daughter had a unique circumstance in that she was home from graduate school for a very short time and needed a procedure. She is in school in LA, yet asked to come home to have Dr. Janssen do her surgery. The staff was extremely helpful given the tight time constrants. Phone calls were returned promptly, and when we met with Dr. Janssen he explained what needed to be done (this was a trama related procedure)with clarity and kindness! After our daughter was out of surgery, Dr. Janssen met us in the waiting room and escorted my husband and I to her recovery room. In addition to the nurses, he checked in on her,and us, frequently until her dismissal. Our follow-up visit was also met with the same consideration. I would highly recommend David Janssen.  "
4205,40845,1.0,Dr. Janssen was very professional and made me feel at ease. His staff is by far the most friendly group of people I ever met.  His staff is very intelligent and kind.  Dr.Janssen was always on time for appointments and seemed to have genuine concern for my well being. 
4206,40845,1.0,"My son who was 6 had cut his chin wide open, I took him to the Mercy Medical E.R., I requested a plastic surgeon to repair the wound.  My son was very nervous but Dr. Janssen was awesome with him &amp; ME.  Even when we had to go to the office to remove the stitches Dr. Janssen &amp; staff made my son very comfortable.  A very GOOD experience for a child.  You can't even see the scar.  I trusted him enough that I scheduled a consultation for my self &amp; had liposuction.  I feel great about my self &amp; would recommend this practice to anyone.  "
4207,40845,1.0,Took time to explain the procedure and all my different options.  He also made me feel that I mattered and that he truly cared.  I also felt he was very knowledgeable and had the expertise I desired in a surgeon.  
4208,40845,1.0,"After finding out I had breast cancer many things came to mind.  The one thing I did not hesitate with was to have Dr. Janssen be the one to do my reconstruction surgery.  His knowledge and expertise skills along with his caring staff walked me through a very difficult time.  I can honestly say he put me at ease, was always available for questions and understood the stress one has to go through during this process.  If I had to do it again he would still be the doctor of choice.  I am a cancer survivor and loving my new look thanks to Dr. Janssen.  "
4209,40845,1.0,"I had a tummy tuck and lipo....sure it looks better than before BUT....the work is BAD! My belly button is too high, I am unevenly lipo-ed and my stomach scar shows with pants on!!!! TERRIBLE bedside manner...he compliments himself too much. I also have lost a lot of feeling around my belly button area that he said would come back and 1 1/2 years later...it hasnt. DO NOT GO HERE!!!! "
4210,40845,1.0,"Excellent service, well trained board-certified surgeons and attentive staff for Botox/Dysport injections. "
4211,40845,1.0,Dr Janssen thinks he is much better than he is. I would never go back to him and I will absolutely tell anyone who asks what a terrible post op doc he is. His work was FAR from satisfactory. 
4212,40846,1.0,"Just an FYI - he was the exact same way back in 2003, when I stopped going to him.  I've always wondered what type of infections you were set up for from his constantly talking on the phone while drilling in your mouth.  He was quite knowledgeable - you just wondered what on earth was going on in his office. "
4213,40847,1.0,Dr. Johnson is the best.  His patient care is the greatest.  I am so glad I have him taking care of my kids and myself.  
4214,40847,1.0,Doctor J is AWESOME!! He delivered both my girls and is there Dr. still. My husband and I both see him. Sometimes hard to get an appt. though. would highly recomend him to people. 
4215,40848,0.0,"Dr. Jones Nosacek is an advocate and teacher for NFP.  No, she doesn't prescribe the Pill.  She taught us a great method of NFP and we are so thankful for that.  NFP takes more than just charting.  It takes discipline and communication.  Even outside of the NFP/BCP issues, Dr. Jones Nosacek is a caring, thoughtful, funny, and interested doctor.  When I was going through a hard time, she called me multiple times.  She has taken care of my daughter and I am willing to drive the distance to get to her.  She is well worth the drive!!  She always asks if we have more questions.  She's always willing to sit and listen.  And she certainly cares about each and every person that comes into her office.   I love this doctor!!! "
4216,40848,0.0,She uses NFP and doesn't pressure you to use birth control (or make you feel like you're loose if you don't want any). 
4217,40848,0.0,She refused to prescribe birth control to me after I already used NFP and got pregnant.  
4218,40849,2.0,Very good. Knows a lot about research. 
4219,40851,1.0, I wish all doctors were like him. He treated me well and my problem is gone.  
4220,40851,1.0," Explained things well, seemed to know what he was talking about and helped my problem. "
4221,40851,1.0," was knowlegeable, explained things, was on time and helped a lot. Paid/Co-pay:$59"
4222,40854,2.0, one of the best doctors around 
4223,40858,1.0," he would rather keep married people together rather than  apart now that he, the husband, and/or the wife should know better; maybe it's a Catholic thing on his part "
4224,40863,1.0, Dr Kaldas is amazing.  He has been with me through two high risk pregancies and I have always felt comfortable and at ease.  He definitely puts the patient first and never rushes us out of the office.  I feel so fortunate to have found him at my OB.   Thank you!!! 
4225,40863,1.0," Can't say enough good, this guy is amazing, talented, extremely competent, and VERY kind.  Thank you, Dr Kaldas! "
4226,40863,1.0, Excellent doctor!  I have neeeded to have several surgeries and Dr. Kaldas has given me excellent care - I trust him for the best care! 
4227,40863,1.0, WONDERFUL!!! I was recomended him with my first pregnancy and i am so happy i went with that recomendation. I will stay with him for all of my yearly appointments and use him with my next pregnancy.  i cannot say enough good things about him!!!! A++ 
4228,40863,1.0, I went to Dr Kaldas and had a etopic pregnany that ruptrued and he was very helpful..He helped me alot with my pcos and endro.Now that my ins changed I can't go to him any more.The OB I have now isn't as good or helpful as he was. I have had numerous surgies and repairs on my uterus and the pain I have is terrible. I feel if I was still with him things would be much better.. I miss him.. He is the best OB in the area. I would highly refer any female to him..  
4229,40863,1.0, I have been going to Dr. Kaldas for seven years. Because of him I lead a pain free life thanks to a hysterectomy and lasering of all endometriosis. Best Doc around. Great with Thyroid problems too. 
4230,40863,1.0," great knowledge base, wonderful bedside manner! Great listener and calming demeaner. "
4231,40863,1.0," I have been through two high risk pregnancies with Dr. Kaldas, laser surgery, and many other issues requiring follow up visits/procedures. He is the best! I trust him with my health without a doubt. He takes his time and exudes confidence with all of his decisions and diagnosis. An all around fantastic individual. "
4232,40863,1.0, I have been old by two other doctors that Dr. Kaldas is &quot;brilliant&quot;. I have been going to him for the past 4 years and had two high risk pregnancies. He is very intelligent and genuinely concerned for his patients. He takes his job very seriously and listens to your concerns. I completely trust the decisions he makes. We are luck to have him here in this area. 
4233,40866,0.0," Dr. Kaehler was great.  She was an excellent listener, and when she did weigh in, it was obvious she knew what she was talking about.  Though, I must say, for the record, that Dr. Kaehler passed away some time ago. "
4234,40866,0.0, Tremendously helpful and attentive to details concerning specific issues raised. Great listener and always willing to consider alternate views. Very professional. 
4235,40866,0.0, Did not listen when we questioned a reaction to meds. Upped the dosage twice after we were concerned. Ended up in hospital. Didn't answer phone message during this time. 
4236,40866,0.0," Attentive, helpful, and suggests more than just medication to allievate mental issues/problems. Very kind and empathetic as well. Very professional.  "
4237,40869,0.0," I saw Dr. K for about a year to help battle a lifelong eating disorder and was soooooo sad when I moved because I couldn't see her any more, and if I could have, would have flown back weekly to continue sessions with her.  Best therapist I EVER had.  We did actual therapy, not just counseling or talk like all my previous therapists did.  Cool office, too! "
4238,40874,1.0, Dr. Kamsler really is a get to know the whole family type of Doctor. He Makes the kids feel at ease which makes the parents feel at ease. He has a lot of specialists he can choose from if specialty help is needed. He Goes that extra step for his patient. You're the Best DR.  MARK 
4239,40874,1.0, Dr Kamsler is a gift to SE Wisconsin.America's health care is controlled by bureaucracy. Insurance has ruined America's sense of wellness.Most doctors are not in the position to make a decision for their patient that isn't directed by ACOG.The powers that control our health care decisions often do not have our best interest in mind.My husband and I are expecting our 6th child. It is an honor to have Dr Kamsler involved in the health care of our children.He has a rare ability to respect and educate parents that desire to think away from the mainstream.He has fantastic tools to offer holistically minded families.MOST importantly he is knowledgeable and skilled in respects to any teachings held by any Academy.Although we rarely see Dr Kamsler because of our unvaccinated children’s extraordinary good health we are looking forward to having him as part of our baby’s birth in 2008.His presence as our daughter’s complicated birth was nothing short of a Godsend. 
4240,40874,1.0," My children have been going to him for 7 years and he is by far the best doctor I have ever been too. He is compassionate, easy to talk to, never talks down at you. My children love going to him. He is extremely knowledgeable. I love that he is not part of a huge corporation and does not have to abide by a ton of corporate rules. He has helped me in so many situations. My daughter had apendicitis and another doctor told me she had the flu 3 times. I went to Dr.Kamsler and he knew what she had right away. he sent me to Childrens, called ahead and it turned out she had a ruptured apendix. He really know what he is doing and is extemely inteligent both in conventinal and natural medicine. He knows when to prescribe a needed medication and then he knows when a nutual product will do the trick. My daughter had a virus when she was 18 months old and she could not keep food down, she was at the point of hospitalization, I purchased some homeopathic pelets and they did the trick. "
4241,40874,1.0," Kind, Compassionate and extremely knowledgeable about both traditional and natural medicines. My son actually LOVES going to the doctor's office! He is amazing and we feel so fortunate. "
4242,40874,1.0, Does not follow recommendations of The American Academy of Pediatrics. 
4243,40880,1.0," Staff unorganized.  Called in prescriptions (for other patient) from front desk area and I heard the meds ordered as well as the name of the patient (i.e. spelling of name, etc.)  Dr. Kadile did not listen to what I had to say upon my third visit and &quot;severed our relationship&quot;.  No compassion whatsoever!  I consider my whole experience to have been costly, disappointing and unprofessional to say the least. "
4244,40880,1.0," I met Dr. Kadile to have him assist me in a life extension plan.  He asked me if I had kids and I said &quot;no&quot;.  He asked me if it was it was by choice (which was none of his business) and I said &quot;yes&quot;.  He got all tensed up, shaking and red-faced...I could tell he was really mad, but didn't say a word.  He went on with the general question and a few minutes later he did calm down got all preachy about why I should have children.  That just spoiled everything for me.  I couldn't go back.  He lost thousands of my future dollars. Paid/Co-pay:$100"
4245,40880,1.0," Dr. Kadile was the only Dr. who took the time to help me lose weight with out any surgery, or diet.  My quality of life changed because of him.  I wish I would have came to him sooner "
4246,40880,1.0, This doctor will diagnose and treat thyroid disorders and allergies with a great deal of thoroughness and knowledge. He is a great doctor. 
4247,40880,1.0," My familiy went to Dr. Kadile many years ago, he was very helpful and kind. He went out of his way to research things and spent a great deal of time with us. We wish we lived closer to him, he was and is a very good doctor. "
4248,40881,1.0," An excellent dentist, but this office charges Beverly Hills prices in Middleton, Wisconsin. "
4249,40881,1.0," My 3 yrs old son has seen Dr.Chris 3 times and loves him. We drive from MN to see him and it has been great. He takes his time and never rushes my child. He is respectful and extremely nice. He has never tried to sell anything extra to us and the treatment we arte doing can only be found in one other place in the country. With all that the most I have spent there was about $ 300. The treatment was not covered by insurance since we did not have it for our son. That included inicial exam, cleaning ( wich Dr. Chis performed himself), ozone ( healozone) treatment in 4 teeth, and a remineralizing kit purchased. I think that waas a fair price. His assistant Carriee was also wonderful.We recomend him. "
4250,40881,1.0, Beware of this dentist as their Center oversells dental work. They tell you you have a cavity when you might have a tiny speck on one tooth that they say might become a cavity. Overcharged us $2000 using this sales approach. 
4251,40885,1.0, Very smart guy. Addressed all issues that I had with factual information.  
4252,40885,1.0,  
4253,40885,1.0," I am a male, 59 years old.  I Would not recommend this guy to anyone! asked me questions, but gave me no time to think about what he asked.  If I did not answer promptly he moved on to the next question, more than once cut me off in my conversation.  But it is when he said to me, &quot;I am trying to make you understand&quot; and its the patients that get called  &quot;anxious&quot;&#63;&#63;&#63;&#63;    He went to school to be the doctor not me, yes patients have questions!  Talked about a procedure he indicated it was not necessary, when I agreed and said ok, he then said he would note in my chart I refused the test at this time&#63;  Another young cocky doctor, don't waste your time on this guy, he's rude and quite conceded. "
4254,40893,2.0,.   
4255,40904,1.0, Dr. Kagen was very knowledgeable.  He's one of the top doctors in his speciality.  He's very personable and easy to talk with.   He help my family and I tremendously! 
4256,40922,1.0, Dr. Tom Kalinosky is by far the most caring doctor I've had the opportunity to meet.  He truly cares about each &amp; every patient that comes into his office. 
4257,40925,0.0," Our wait time for a scheduled appointment was 2 hrs and 15 minutes.  Asked receptionist if this was typical and she said, &quot;Yes.&quot;  I won't ever return to see him. "
4258,40925,0.0, Terrible doctor. He did not help me with my condition (thinning hair as a young woman) and he was also incredibly rude. I would not recommend this doctor to anyone. 
4259,40928,2.0," Horrible customer service - it has taken weeks and weeks to get my glasses, tons of wasted trips and they can not seem to get an order right. They forget to give you the discount for using them bsased on your insurance and it takes weeks to get your money back for their error. They do not take accountability for their errors and pass the blame off to anyone they can. I can not express enough how poor the customer service is. Avoid this place like the plaugue.  "
4260,40928,2.0," Very detail oriented, knowledeable and helpful.  Staff is polite and helpful as well.  Highly recommend. "
4261,40930,1.0, awesome dr!!! very helpful and kind. i highly recommend him. 
4262,40930,1.0," Very very good MD. I have been working with Dr. Kamelle for 4 years now.  He has a good bed side manner, and really cares about his patients.  I am very pleased of the care that I am receiving with Dr. Kamelle.  I would reccomend him to anyone that is in need of a Gynecological Oncologist.  "
4263,40930,1.0," Dr. Kamelle is confident,optimistic and highly skilled  in his profession. He listens compassionately to patients concerns and offers multiple options for treatment. If surgery is your treatment option,you can be certain he will do a fantastic job. All around wonderful Doctor. "
4264,40930,1.0," I have full confidence in this doctor.  He is kind, caring and invests himself in his patient's wellbeing. "
4265,40937,0.0," Totally agree with other review of this doctor. Saw her once and never went back, but was at her mercy again some years later when my regular doctor asked for her opinion concerning a problem my then 20-day old infant was suffering. Not only was her advice terrible, but she then proceeded to completely ignore me, treating me as nothing more than a fly on the wall instead of a HUMAN BEING. Never, never again will I go anywhere near this doctor. "
4266,40937,0.0," Will not see this doctor ever again. She is cold, unfriendly, and makes me feel completely ill-at-ease in her office. Her clinical skills also need some brushing up.  "
4267,40939,1.0, Awesome doctor very caring. He is very nice and good with patients. 
4268,40939,1.0, Entirely unhelpful. He has a horrible demeanor and will not consider his patients best interest (maybe due to his own gigantic ego and desperate need for power). He is one of the absolutely worst human beings I have ever come across in my entire lifetime. Unless you want to be spoken to with complete condescension and receive inadequate care then avoid this &quot;pseudo&quot; doctor (not a real MD) at all costs.  
4269,40939,1.0," I have been seeing DR Kaiser for over 10 years now. He is very concerned and knows how to explain medical things in terms that we can understand. I have NEVER seen the dog collar aid that was spoken of. His Nurse, Karen is the Best. Judy in the Reception center is one of the nicest most efficient and knowing people you will ever want to meet. perhaps the more casual atmosphere at the clinic was misinterprited as uncaring. But I tell you, you will never find a more caring and giving Doctor. EVER. He does not push pills, He does not push procedures. He referes his patients to specialists if he feels we need one.  I have never been sorry that he is my doctor!  ~Toni "
4270,40939,1.0, Run from this Doctor!  He actually swears while explaining things. His staff ugh... you will wait a good half and hour in the waiting room and then another 10 for him in the patient room.  One of the  nurse assistants was wearing a spiked dog collar and a nose ring!! A Surreal Nightmarish Doctor Visit for sure....  
4271,40939,1.0, Very Punctual. Willing to take take time to talk to patients and get to know his patients. Paid/Co-pay:$260
4272,40941,1.0," Very wonderful experience here from the office staff to the hearing technincian(I do not know her name). The hearing technician was very sweet and calming. I did not actually work with Dr. Kandula this time, but worked with Ashley Hertel and she was very professional, knowledgeable, and made me feel very comfortable. I would highly recommend these professionals to anyone looking for an EN&T. ; Thank you for a wonderful experience! I hope you get to read this!! "
4273,40941,1.0," The doctor was on time for my appointment.  This is huge because I have to take the time from work to make appointments during the day.    Thanks to everyone -- they execute perfectly, and are extremely pleasant to work with.  "
4274,40941,1.0, Dr. Kandula and his staff were excellent and attentive.  
4275,40941,1.0," Dr. Kandula is very personable and caring.  He has helped every member of my family through various ENT issues.  From medicines to surgery, he is up to speed with the latest and greatest.  His staff is awesome as well.  "
4276,40941,1.0, I would say Dr. Kandula is the best ENT I have ever been to. My experience was wonderful! He knows what he is doing.  Prompt and efficient! Very satisfied! 
4277,40941,1.0," Dr. Kandula is simply THE BEST.  He has the ultimate combination of compassion and expert hands.  If you have ENT problems, look no further.  "
4278,40945,1.0," This physician may be a good doctor, but he does not listen to the patient.  The office staff leaves a lot to b desired.  I rate this doctor and office staff at poor. "
4279,40947,1.0,"Dr. Lenz has been my son's doc since he was born. He is a very nice man, but boy does he talk! His staff of nurses are good, but the receptionists are very rude. It is always a super long wait, so give yourself extra time. After waiting forever, he comes in and talks for sometimes up to 40 minutes. It sounds good but it can get a little annoying. Overall, he's a good doctor. "
4280,40947,1.0,"Dr. Lenz is an incredible doctor.  He is very knowledgable and passionate about certain issues and ADHD is one along with smoking, weight, etc.  Dr. Lenz after long testing helped me when I did not know I had ADHD.  The fast locomotive in my head I thought was normal, but now I can concentrate and focus on one task at a time.  He also has helped me quit smoking and become non-insulin dependent as a diabetic and am forever grateful.  My son also has ADHD which is hereditary and now going into the third grade is just starting to write stories and understand what he is reading and focus thanks to Dr. Lenz.  He is so caring of my husband after a work injury and continues to help him work through continuous problems.  Everybody has an off day I know, but I must admit if Dr. Lenz has an off day I have yet to see it and would recommend him to absolutely ANYONE I know, ANYTIME.  Thank you very much for your hard work and patience Dr. Lenz (if you ever get a chance to read this).  "
4281,40947,1.0,"I am a registered nurse, and am very picky about my health care providers. I do not see physicians unless they are up to date on current research and trends. I want someone who treats me with respect and care, and includes me in directing my care. I have found Dr. Lenz to be the best primary care physician I have ever had. He always takes as much time as I need in the office, and spends a lot of time getting to know me and my concerns. I always leave his office very appreciative of his help. I have never had a physician who has taken so much time to address my concerns. Due to family health issues and my job, I know many physicians. I highly recommend Dr. Lenz without reservation!! "
4282,40947,1.0,"Dr. Lenz is very so-so. I am a young woman and he made me feel uncomfortable during my visit. He seems to know quite a bit, yet isn't very personable.  "
4283,40947,1.0,"HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE!!! I went with my fiance to have a routine checkup (he went, not me)  and to have him look at some strange bone growths he was experiences. I kid you not, while feeling his ribcage (where the bulk of the bone growth is) he asked, &quot;Soo, did you have trouble concentrating in school&#63;&#63;&quot; &quot;What&#63;!&#63;!&quot; He kept pushing, and pushing, and pushing, that my 20 year old fiance has ADHD and MUST have Adderall. He even called his mother to pressure her that he did in fact have this &quot;problem&quot;. It was ridiculous!!! No was not an answer with this man. The thing that sealed the deal was when he addressed me as &quot;girl in the corner&quot; (excuse me&#63;!&#63;!) and then insinuating I tricked my fiance into getting me pregnant. Yeah....horrible, horrible doctor. I would never recommend him to a single soul. Unless of course they want Adderall when they have weird bone issues.  Sounds so ridiculous reading this through again, but it's the complete truth, unfortunately. "
4284,40949,0.0,"Dr. Larson is not a very thourough doctor. I went in to see her complaining of a sore thoat. She did not even give me a throat culture. I then went spent money out of pocket and went to the ER and was diagnosed with Strep Throat. She also made rude remarks about me while in her office when she was a Urgent Care doctor at Affinity. Please our community does not need doctors like Dr. Larson. There is NO ROOM FOR MISTAKES in the Medical Profession. I know why she left Affinity and went to Aroura, she was the worst doctor I have ever seen. Shame on you, Dr. Alyson Larson!!! "
4285,40949,0.0,"I have been seeing Dr. Larson for over a year.  She and her staff are outstanding in every way, including punctuality, kindness, and overall patient care.  From the first minute I walked in, and the receptionist Michelle stood up and shook my hand and introduced herself, I knew I had the right doctor.  I can't say enough wonderful things about this highly professional office.  As a side note, there is an office from this same health network 2 blocks from my house, and I drive 20 minutes to see Dr. Larson.  "
4286,40950,2.0,.  
4287,40951,0.0,"Very helpful. As a transsexual it was important to find a doctor that was both knowledgeable about the processes involved, and willing to work with me, and Dr. Leigh is both. She's was helpful to the point of being enthusiastic about helping to meet my care needs, which is rare for this condition in the Midwest. At first I wasn't certain I would leave a comment because the rarity of my condition is potentially identifying, but in case there are others out there, it's important that they know Dr. Leigh is NOT the sort of doctor you hear gatekeeper horror stories about.  "
4288,40952,1.0,I found Dr. Levin to be very knowledgeable about my condition. His bedside manner was excellent and he was very good in discussing the various options to take. I'm glad that I found him rather than having a general surgeon for my situation. Great guy! Glad he is in Madison 
4289,40952,1.0, 
4290,40953,0.0,"I'm seeing this doctor for pre-natal care and she's awesome.  Very understanding, very helpful, and I'm always able to reach her via email -- and get answers quickly!  She's also our family doctor and she's great with kids.  I highly recommend her.  "
4291,40954,2.0,Very knowledgable and personable. Would recommend to a friend! 
4292,40954,2.0,Feeling much better. Discussed why adjustment was needed and how we will proceed. 
4293,40955,0.0,"My husband and I have seen Dr. Lentfer for 4 years now and just love her.  She took cafre of me through my pregnancy and helped deliver my little boy via c-section.  Although we don't always agree on the childhood vaccination schedule, she respects that I am the parent, and ultimately, it is my decision.  She is caring, honest and we never feel like a number.  The clinic staff is great and she is wonderful.  I think she listens to our concerns and takes the time to discuss options.  Never has she ever pushed pills on us.  I would highly recommend her. "
4294,40955,0.0,Just does not listen. Think what she want to think and also a pill pusher. 
4295,40956,1.0,he helped me though everything that was going on in my ovary with all the cyst i was making. i was suffering with this for 4 years until he found out what he was wrong with me. I went to so many doctors for this and he was the only one that helped.  
4296,40956,1.0,Dr. Lalich is very compasionate and very helpful.  He answers questions in plain english and he isn't condescending at all! He sat with me and answered all of my questions - he wasn't constantly looking for the door! 
4297,40957,1.0,Excellent Doctor!  He takes his time and does a detailed job. 
4298,40957,1.0,great doctor.   Takes his time to listen and is very knowledgeable 
4299,40957,1.0,listens well and works well with children and teens 
4300,40957,1.0,"Dr Lemkuil is personable and responsive to patient concerns and questions. At first I was put off by a couple things that I had not encountered before, eg, using stethoscope through clothing (reduces sensitivity) but it is a contamination preventions step and is not done during periodic exams. HE appears to have a  good knowledge base and seems thorough. On an early visit he called with test results that were actually better than previous tests while he flagged the current results as concerning. Subsequent visits indicate thorough review of one's medical history at each visit. To what extent he stays current is difficult to ascertain unless one runs into a clear conflict with recent information they have discovered on their own but evidence so far indicates current knowledge. (I improved my previous rating; old rating deleted) "
4301,40957,1.0,"Dr. Lemkuil always presents me with my treatment options and includes me in the decision making. He doesn't always know what is wrong with me, but he admits it and offers the treatment he can. He is very personable and when I've been at my worst health-wise, he made me feel like things were under control and that we'd figure it out. I've recommended him to friends because of his friendly, caring manner. He's even called me at home on two occassions to touch base with my situation, which I've never encountered before with other doctors. "
4302,40957,1.0,Daniel was our family Doctor for 3 years before we moved. We actually were very sad in leaving him as our Doctor.  He truly does care about our family which is more than I can say for most doctors today! 
4303,40957,1.0,Excellent manner with the kids. He is very thorough.  
4304,40958,2.0,Did not help my migraine in any way in St. Mary's Emergency Room.  Very inflexible.  
4305,40959,1.0,Great doctor.Very thorough.He was recommended by a local nurse and I have been very satisfied.  
4306,40959,1.0,Very helpful.  Took time to listen and explain everything 
4307,40959,1.0,Took the time to talk with you and make you feel like you're heard.  Great with kids.  
4308,40960,1.0,"I have gone to this Dr. for years and received excellent treatment including a knee replacement and rotator cuff surgery. I recommend him, although he isn't warm and fuzzy -- just good and efficient. "
4309,40960,1.0,"After reading other testimonies, I realize I am not the only one. Dr. Lemon made many false accusations in a report to my employer! As a result, I am receiving no worker's compensation, am not released to go back to work, and am worrying how I will pay my next bill. Please note that Dr. Lemon has never seen me nor talked to me.  "
4310,40960,1.0,"very condensending preoccupied, did not like that i had a opinion from a very well known specailist "
4311,40960,1.0,"Dr Lemon's treatment was dismissive and wrong. He told me my knee pain was caused by osteoarthritis based on an x-ray, even tho I noted that the injury and pain started after a fall and felt very different than the regular minor arthritic pain I feel in both knees.  He balked at suggestion of an MRI to see if there was soft tissue damage.  Later, I finally got an MRI ordered by my pcp, and a different Orthopedic Surgeon confirmed a meniscal tear, a cartilage tear and a cyst that needed to be removed surgically. (The tears were small but also would be smoothed to avoid further damage since the surgery was necessary for the cyst anyway.) The cyst turned out to be the size of half a golf ball with a long tail that was growing around my knee.  The surgeon said had it not been removed, it would likely have kept growing and growing.  I am just so happy I finally got excellent treatment, had the problem confirmed and addressed effectively medically, had the surgery and am now on the mend! "
4312,40960,1.0,"I experienced what many others have.  I received a PPD (perminant partial disability) rating of 5% from my Doctor.  The insurace carrier sent me to Dr. Lemon to dispute what my Dr. said.  He inaccurately claimed I had a pre-existing condition, stated I was fully recovered 1 year before I stopped treatment and therefore I had a 0% PPD rating.  Dr. Lemon is a disgrace to his profession and should not be allowed to practice.  "
4313,40960,1.0,"This doctor has a history of lying in his reports and claims that workers injuries are pre-existing so the insurance company gets out of paying benefits.  He sells his testimony, reports, and diagnoses.  He's a disgrace to the medical community and should have his license revoked.  "
4314,40961,1.0,.  
4315,40961,1.0,"Dr. Tom was my childhood Dentist, and when possible, i always seek him out.  he keeps up with the state of the art, and never compromises the patients needs and attempts to accomidate them at all times.  He cares more about your teeth, he cared about the rest of you too.  "
4316,40961,1.0,"I do not recommend this dentist at all, his attitude is very cold and uncaring.  I was treated for TMJ and the &quot;treatment&quot; made the condition worse.  "
4317,40961,1.0,Whole office seems like they have major attitudes.Also didnt treat me for my problems i came with but tried to get my to fix something that wasnt bothering me for 2x the amount of money.  Hmmm possibly tring to fill their pockets&#63; 
4318,40961,1.0,Dr LaSelle is very caring and compassionate. He makes sure you are not in pain and are comfortable. He offers sedation dentistry and it is great! Very good at answering any questions you have. Excellent staff.  
4319,40962,1.0,"I was a victim of a severe auto collision.  Dr. Lange was in charge of my case.  I had broken both arms, heals, neck, nose, orbital and had a calcaneus  reconstructure done by this Dr.  Dr. Lange was so wonderful and went the extra yards to help in all my discomfort.  I can't thank him enough.  "
4320,40962,1.0,Dr. Lange is great. He is very thorough. Does a great physical exam.  He always explains his reasoning so you understand what is going on and why he wants to take the course of action/treatment that he does.  He is very caring and respectful. 
4321,40963,0.0,Excellent Dr- worth the wait -good idea to call ahead to find out if she is on schedule.   Again she is the best! 
4322,40963,0.0,"I've gone to Dr. Rebecca Lawrence for years and following every appointment I think, &quot;She is the most personal, informative and caring doctor I have ever had.&quot;  She gives such personal attention, you would think she was your closest friend.  Dr. Lawrence is thorough and she knows how to talk on your level.  If someone asks who I go to, I refer them to her.  She is the only physician I have ever felt strong enough about to refer to and I am 54.  It is hard to get appointments but I'll compromise if it means I get the best.  You will never feel like your appointment is rushed with Dr. Lawrence.  She is not only a superb doctor, she is genuinely nice person. "
4323,40963,0.0,"Dr Rebecca Lawrence is the BEST.  She's very thorough, caring and explains things.  She is such a caring doctor and will even call you at home to followup.  She's a very caring and sincere doctor.  I've had her for at least 15 years and she is SIMPLY THE BEST in her field.  I'd recommend her to any one. Her nurse, Georgia, is also very helpful.  The practice is very busy but Dr Lawrence takes the time with you.  No rush in and rush out.  She truly cares about her patients.  She's awesome and I thank God for her.  I hope to be her patient for another 15 years or more.  Thank you Dr Rebecca Lawrence=you are a wonderful ob/gyn and so caring.  "
4324,40963,0.0,WONDERFUL WONDERFUL WONDERFUL!  I always felt at ease with Dr. Lawrence and she always had plenty of time to talk to me.  The birth of my daughter was great with her help and postpartum I had some complications and she was extremely helpful in getting me into her clinic ASAP to be seen and help me out.  
4325,40963,0.0,"Though her practice is booked solid, Dr. Lawrence will still take the time to be thorough and answer questions.  I would certainly recommend her to anyone else.  "
4326,40965,0.0,She knows her stuff 
4327,40966,2.0, 
4328,40967,2.0,Very respectable :) 
4329,40968,1.0,My appointments were canceled constantly. He was always overbooked so that he didn't have time to see his patients. He says he specializes in high risk pregnancy but didn't recognize that my pregnancy was high risk. It wasn't until I went to another doctor specializing in this field that I found out that indeed I was high risk. In fact my daughter was born a month early despite my being on bedrest for over 2 months. In this particular practice you need a high degree of sensitivity and tact. I found his office to be extremely unhelpful and unfriendly. It is also my opinion that Dr. Larson is not as knowledgeable as I would like when it comes to something as important as my child. 
4330,40969,0.0,She is a fantastic doctor.  She really listens and does not brush off a &quot;mom's gut feeling.&quot;  She is a mom too and understands that 6th sense that moms have when something is going on with their kids.  My kids have been seeing her for 7 years.  She  gets to know her patients.  She asks the kids how their sports and other activities are going not just how they are feeling.  She has a child with asthma so she is very knowledgeable on how to manage and treat it from both sides of the fence (a Dr. and a mom).  We love her!  I don't know if she is accepting new patients though.  I think her patients like her so much that they tend to stay with her. 
4331,40969,0.0,Excellent physician; takes time to listen and gets to know you as an individual. She orders tests when appropriate but doesnt waste your time or money on unnecessary things.  I've gone to her for 7 years and think she's the best.  
4332,40970,1.0,"Treats patients poorly, the second things dont go smoothly, you are out of luck and he is out the door.  "
4333,40971,1.0,do not ask Q's or dare to disagree w/ his opinion. A real pill pusher !! 
4334,40971,1.0,Dr. Lawler is conscientious and very very smart. He doesn't talk down to the patient and helped me understand my illness and let me be an active participant in deciding the course of treatment. 
4335,40972,2.0,"According to my trauma doctor at Froedtert Hospital Dr. LeSage did not sew up a portion of the stomach wall (during a rou-en-y) and my small intestine lodged into the lining. I had 16 surgeries, 39 days at Froedtert, 2x almost dying and am now permenantly disabled. I am on TPN 3 days a week and my medical costs are astronomical. I could not sue due to the statute of limitations.  "
4336,40973,1.0,"I am a registered nurse and I have found Dr. Lange to be very knowledgeable and well-read.  He is always able to quote the most recent articles in regards to treatments, diagnoses, etc.  He sometimes runs behind but it's because he gives you the time you need to express your concerns and he takes the time to assess the situation in order to offer the correct, most cost-efficient treatment plan.  "
4337,40973,1.0,"You may want to be very careful and get a second opinion before you take his medical advice.  While he can seem like a caring and intelligent person who gives you time and explains things, are they in your best interest&#63;  Some medications prescribed are not always necessary and can lead to dire consequences.  While it may seem at the time that he is helping it leads to so much more trouble and when you really need things resolved he may become suddenly uninterested.   Be very very cautious!! "
4338,40974,1.0,Dr. Laufer was our doctor for both our children until we moved out of state.  DR LAUFER WE MISS YOU!  He helped us so much as a doctor and a parent.  He is on your team and I truly felt he was rooting for us.  
4339,40974,1.0,He is by far the best pediatrician i've ever brought my kids to.  
4340,40974,1.0,"He is very thorough and doesn't rush you out of the office. He actually sits down and waits until all your questions are answered before even heading towards he door. My daughter was very ill, and I feel he went above and beyond with reassuring us and doing everything he could to get her well. I strongly recommend him to anyone looking for a good ped doctor. (Added bonus- he's really good looking!!) "
4341,40976,2.0,Would not recommend.  Once our accounts were paid in full - the level of care and customer service fell to the point of non-existence.  
4342,40977,1.0,"Dorctor Leone is a wonderful doctor.  He speaks to you like a person, treats you like a friend instead of a patient.  He is able to tell when things seem to be weighing on you and getting to much and is able to ease you, even offer suggestions of good therapist in the area if you both think it is a good idea.  He is very understanding and caring.  Dr.  Leone is a human being and knows his patients are as well and treats them as such.  He is truly an A+ doctor and I am glad to have met him and happy he is my neurologist, not happy I need one, but happy that he is the one I have for one... "
4343,40978,1.0,"Dr Lee is a great doctor! He is very patient and takes the time to sit with you and answer all your questions. Making his patients feel comfortable is very important to him. I've never felt like he was rushing through my appointment, just the opposite. "
4344,40979,0.0,"I love her. She's a great doctor and I'm disappointed my insurance changed. She has seen me through some very traumatic times and was always caring, professional, knowledgable and did everything she could do.  "
4345,40979,0.0,Dr. Landauer is very easy to talk to about any problems you have.  She truly cares!  Couldn't be happier with her.  Common sense does prevail with this doctor. 
4346,40979,0.0, 
4347,40980,1.0,"Complex asthma/respiratory condition. He was approachable, listened and immensely knowledgeable in approach and treatment of condition. The staff had encouragement and professional teaching for adolescent patient. "
4348,40981,0.0,"I have been to see Dr. Lawrence several times over the years -- first by myself when I was depressed, and then with my husband when we were having marital problems.  She has always made me feel very comfortable and understood, and I felt she was much more &quot;real&quot; than the couple of other therapists I had tried in the past.  Dr. Ann seems to know a lot about a lot of things, and she helps you to see yourself and your circumstances in a way that lets you move forward and resolve problems effectively.  I have referred many friends to her over the years and will continue to do so.  The only negative is that she is not a participating provider with my insurance plan -- but I would still go back to her if I ran into difficulty again! "
4349,40982,1.0,This dentist is VERY GOOD! He will help in any way to make your expierence with him a plesant one. He uses headphones with the radio on and the staff is very friendsly. He does anything that you ask of him to with explaining the best thing for you. He is the only Dentist that my family will use from this point forward as long as he is covered iunder my insurance. I wouldn't switch willingly but I won't pay more just to go there.  
4350,40982,1.0,"Had never been to this dentist before.  So before hand called and asked if the Dr. could cut out a bridge and extract a tooth that I have never been able to bite on.  Was assured Dr. could do this.  Appt. made, when I went into Dr lees office all he kept saying for two hours is you don't want to cut that $5000.00 bridge, have a root canal done on that tooth and you won't have any more problems with chewing on that side.  Will after two hours I finally said ok little did I know that within 24 hours of Dr Lees care I would land in the hospital with an IV for three days and antibiotics for another 10 days and loose 13 days of work with two jobs and still had to go see an oral surgeon to get the tooth removed.  The oral surgeon said that this is a tooth that should have never been saved and showed me approximately 12  little pieces of the tooth and said there was nothing left of the tooth.   That I had made the right call on wanting to get this tooth pulled DO NOT GO TO THIS DENTIST! "

4352,40983,1.0,"Changed insurance, came to him for new doctor choice.  Have never looked back, best choice I made.  Been with him since.   Has been a positive health choice since too! "
4353,40983,1.0,"not co-operative, poor comunication to patient "
4354,40984,2.0, 
4355,40985,1.0,"ALWAYS Running behind and staff do not inform you, have to ask how long it's going to be.  Word in town is that he's there for the money, tries to see as many patients as he can in one day - hence the reason he is always behind (he's double booked)  Does not ask many questions of patients.  Took my son to see him and wanted to start meds after the first visit!  Diagnosed him as bipolar due to a family hx though we in the family all thought he had ADHD.  He wanted to put him on antipsychotics right away.  We went elsewhere, had testing done.   Dx with ADHD started on ADHD med instead of an antipsychotic and grades went from c/d's to A's!  Whole different kid!  Maybe if he listened to the people involved he would dx correctly! "
4356,40985,1.0,"Always running late and staff never inform you, just leave you sit.  Seems to not comment much and asks very general questions.  "
4357,40985,1.0,Dr. Larson is an outstanding psychiatrist.  He truly listens to his patients and is extremely thorough in examination regarding past and current mental history and physical well-being.  He attempts to achieve and maintain the correct balance in both. He is diligent in attempts at providing the proper diagnoses and in the development of each individual's treatment plan; I am the grateful recipient of his success. He possesses a wonderfully kind and caring personality.  I can happily state that I would not be on this earth today if it had not been for Dr. Larson's expertise and understanding. I strongly recommend this wonderful psychiatrist! 
4358,40986,2.0,This guy is by far the BEST in the business 
4359,40987,0.0,I love Dr. Lee.  She goes the extra mile to be sure the diagnosis is correct.  She also has a great personality and is very easy to talk to.  
4360,40987,0.0,"I've seen her several times, she is a very knowledgable doctor, and is extremely caring. She knows what to test for, and I feel very relaxed knowing I have her as my doctor. She listens to your symptoms as a person and as a doctor and really cares about your well being...as all doctors should. I would recommend her to anyone! "
4361,40988,1.0,"Ive doctored with Dr. Lyle for more than 20 years. In my opinion he has always been a caring, responsible Physician. He always seems to be prompt and willing to go the extra mile, to bring comfort to his patients. Ive found him knowledgable and very capable. I would recommend his care to anyone I knew, in my opinion there isnt anyone better in the Chiropractic field. I havent been to them all so you will have to just trust my opinion. "
4362,40990,1.0,Dr. Larson opened up after hours to see me in an emergency.  He was extremely thorough.  Some of these other reviews seem very questionable (especially the one that claims he refused to tell what the condition was).  Also saw Dr. Lavey.  Both were professional and knowledgeable. 
4363,40990,1.0,"Overall, I am very disappointed with Dr. Larson.  His staff was very VERY kind and helpful, but Dr. Larson himself was very unfriendly and not professional.  I recently had an operation where I had to wait in the operation chair for over a half hour due to his tardiness. During the operation he said very little. His nurse was the one explaining everything to me and encouraging me.  After the operation, he took off before I even sat up from the table. The real kicker is, I had a problem with the medications (anti-biotic and painkiller) prescribed, where when he was the doctor on call, he was unable to get a hold of and would not return mine nor the pharmacies phone calls.  After nearly 3 hours of horrid pain and no anti-biotics, the pharmacist got a hold of a nurse at the office who called the other doctor on staff to help me.  If you or your loved ones are looking for a friendly doctor who cares about his patients and their well-being, I highly recommend looking elsewhere.  "
4364,40990,1.0,"I was initially seen in the ER on a Saturday. Diagnosis and treatment was started for a corneal infection (ulcer&#63;) Dr Larsn called me at home later that day and again on Sunday to be sure I was  comfortable and that I would be coming in for a follow-up on Monday.   I was impressed with his caring manner ( I have never had a Dr call me) his staff, and all of the follow-up visits to his office "
4365,40990,1.0,Would never go to Dr. Larson again.  I was passed from person to person &amp; got less then 2 min. w/ Dr. Larson he told me I had an eye condition &amp; would not take time to explain it.  I asked if they had any info on the condition was told no.  I could only get them to right the condition down so I could research it on my own.  
4366,40990,1.0,"After waiting 6 weeks to get scheduled for an outpatient cataract surgery, my elderly father never regained eyesight following the surgery.  GET A SECOND OPINION BEFORE YOUR PARENT OR LOVED ONE LOSES THEIR INDEPENDENCE AND QUALITY OF LIFE.  "
4367,40991,1.0,. he's a good person to erson DR very nice but don't like to work with my meds told me i had to see a phyciatrist behavior routine to see 1 never had any problem etting my meds refilled or kept up he refuses to do what my other DR had wanted to do because of all my conditions and head in juries and starokes and al a MRI of my brain but Badger Care Plus denied him i wasnt registered with that isurance com and it has to be done to help see any damages there are from al the falls i take he doesnt keep updated with all new updates of how to help patiences better he doen't have any knowedge of my many diseases or anything 
4368,40992,1.0,"Dr. Leach was great. I just was concerned about an issue I was having that turned out to be PCOS and picked the Doctor that was available the soonest. I was very glad that I did. Dr. Leach sat with me for over an hour at my first visit and his nurse KiKi was also great. Dr. Leach has a great bedside manner and an awesome sense of humor, which is rare in most doctors I've seen. Dr. Leach eventually sent me for an ultrasound and sat down with me to explain the results. A couple months later I thought I may have had another condition as well and Dr. Leach didn't feel insulted at all and gladly sent me for the bloodwork. Sadly, a couple months later he got a job in Manitowoc and moved. I debated on keeping him as my OB/GYN but the drive was just too far. I highly recommend him to anyone in the Manitowoc area.  "
4369,40992,1.0,"Dr. Leach took every possible step to get to know me--something that is very valuable when determining how to treat individual patients.  I felt like I was able to be clear and firm with what I wanted out of a Dr. and he made me feel like my requests would be granted without problem.  Excellent at communication, good sense of humor, very knowledgeable about his work, and also let you get to know him.  I am excited to work with him during this pregnancy and for other future needs. "
4370,40992,1.0,"Dr. Leach punctured my bladder during surgery, didn't recognize his error, sewed me up, and tried to hide his work by transferring me to 2 other facilities. My body blew up like a balloon with fluids, I was critically ill, he was not confident in caring for me at my final destination, (Aurora)and I have legal action pending against him. Beware.  "
4371,40992,1.0,DR. LEACH IS THE BEST DOCTOR. WHEN YOU GO TO HIS OFFICE TO TALK TO HIM IT IS LIKE TALKING TO A FRIEND AND HE ANSWERS ALL OF THE QUESTIONS 
4372,40992,1.0,"Dr. Leach is an amazing doctor.  He is by far the best doctor in the milwaukee area.  He is kind and down to earth.  Always makes time to answer all of your questions and make you feel comfortable.  He has delivered my two children and my husband and i plan on having at least two more and I'm so comfortable knowing Dr. Leach will be there.  It is so hard to find a great doctor now a days, but Dr. Leach truly is one amazing doctor.  Also, his nurse Kiki makes you feel at eased and is always pleasant.  "
4373,40992,1.0,"I recently saw Dr. Leach for the first time and was very pleased with his bedside manner and wealth of knowledge.  He made me feel very comfortable, there is no question that you cannot ask him-very down to earth and pleasant. "
4374,40992,1.0,"Dr. Leach is a fantastic doctor with great bedside manner.  When I first went to see him, he sat down with me and discussed what I was there to see him about.  We ran some test to see what was wrong with me and I never had to wonder when the results were going to come.  Him or his nurse, Kiki, always called as soon as they came in a and we went from there.  He also personally checked in with me while I was in the hospital to make sure things were going okay and to make sure I was being treated well.  He knows a ton and is eager to share the imformation with me in a way that I'll understand.  "
4375,40993,1.0,"I agree very good,very concerned about patient,and family too. "
4376,40993,1.0,Dr Leibert is an amazing Doctor. He always takes the time to answer questions. My children love him and I think that says alot. He is very knowledgable and truly cares about his patients. We recommend Dr Leibert to everyone we know with children. We have been seeing him for 13 years with no negative experiences.  
4377,40994,1.0,. been my doctor for over two years a friend recomended him to me and i have never had any issues 
4378,40994,1.0,"Very informed, up to date on research.  Took his time and covered things in detail as I needed them.  Great personality.  "
4379,40994,1.0,A physical with him was the worst experience I have ever had. I will never go back to him again. 
4380,40995,1.0,Dr Leveille is friendly enough but needs more training in endocrine issues especially thyroid.  He would not even do a test on my until I demanded it after feeling terrible and researching it all myself.  I knew I was suffering just like my sister with this disease.  Well I was RIGHT and the test came back way off.  If he does not know how to treat an illness then refer them to someone who does.  I guit going to him and found an internal medicine doctor with more common sense and knowledge.  
4381,40995,1.0,"Dr. Leveille is an okay doctor. He doesnt have great bedside manner or make you feel comfortable, however he is very knowlodgeable and his nurse is very pleasant. Went to him a few times and am undecided on weather or not I will keep him. "
4382,40995,1.0,. Wonderful Doctor 
4383,40996,1.0,I can see!!!  Talked to me and answered all my questions.  Took time.  All I cam say is I've never seen so well in my life since he did cataract surgery on me 
4384,40996,1.0,The vision in my eye is twice as bad after he operated. Another person walked out of his office just before me saying &quot;but I still can't see&quot;. 
4385,40997,1.0,"I've dealt with Dr. Lesko for years.  Scoped my knee, Acl Repair on one of the kids, worked through petellar tendonites on another, and a new knee for my mom.  absolutely outstanding on all 4 occasions! "
4386,40997,1.0,"I saw Dr. Lesko three times for a broken foot.  He was arrogant, condescending, and rude.  The 2nd visit he spent more time complaining abut the health care reform and Obama than looking at my foot.  The third visit he appeared very annoyed that I had called several times that week regarding a buzzing in my foot.  When I came in he made reference to my phone calls as if they were a bother to him.  His instructions to me were to put a shoe on start walking through it.  I saw a new doctor the following week at which time a fracture was diagnosed exactly where I was telling Dr. Lesko it hurt.  He never did follow up xrays or MRI to see if additional damage was done. He tried to tell me I was developing RSD, reflex sympathy dysdrophy, in other words it was all in my head!  In my opinion he was an idiot and  I feel he has a problem with women. I will tell everyone not to go to hime EVER.  "
4387,40998,0.0,"Jennifer was great! It was my first appointment with her, after my primary physician relocated recently.  She was very methodical, and went carefully through my past medical history with me. She was very polite, and very thorough.  She explained everything she was thinking to me in detail, making sure I had time to ask questions.  A very pleasant experience.  "
4388,40999,1.0,Motorcyle accident and Dr. Lang did emergency surgery to save leg.  Follow-up visits also.  Takes time to answer questions  and is very helpful. 
4389,40999,1.0,"My husband was a trama patient.  He was lucky Dr Lang was on call. He is an excellent orthapedic surgeon with an excellent, knowledgeable staff.  Great bedside manner, really cares about his patients.  "
4390,41000,1.0,Very good doctor. Takes time to listen and doesnt make up your mind for you. He is very compassionate (even calling on a weekend with test results). His Nurse Charlotte and Mindy are very nice as well.  
4391,41001,1.0,Best podiatrist I have ever visited. He was caring and helpful. 
4392,41002,1.0,"Dr Langen, and his nurse Mary Jo, were outstanding and made my bunion surgery a positive experience.  I 100% recommend Dr. Langen, and the entire staff, at Mile Bluff Clinic &amp; Hess Memorial.  Each and every staff member was kind, understanding and a wonderful caregiver.  Bunion surgery isn't fun, but my surgery was successful due to the excellent care from Dr. Langen.  I am extremely happy that I go to Mile Bluff for all my health care needs.  I also appreciate the patience and kind reception I have received from the front desk reception ladies, and the receptionist for Dr. Langen.  They are all excellent to work with.  Thank you everyone for your help and excellent care! "
4393,41004,1.0,Few months ago I went to Dr. Lanoway for the first time for back pain. He helped relieve some of the pain. I might of continued my treatment but his hours were very limited and I found myself waiting 30 minutes or more past my scheduled appointment. Or the doctor would come in late for work. Dr. Lanoway would do what he called a side posture adjustment&#63; There were times when after performing this adjustment he would fall on top of me. And there were times I could smell alcohol on him. I do not recommend this Chiropractor.  
4394,41005,1.0,PLEASE FOR YOUR FAMILY AND YOU DONT SEE THIS DOCOR!!!!  This doctor does not listen and would not perform a scabies test on me because he &quot;knew&quot; it wasn't scabies.  Seeing him twice and getting the same advice and only seeing me for 10 min. max at a time...he would not listen (ego too big maybe) I decided to seek a free clinic and they confirmed scabies.   PLEASE FOR YOUR FAMILY AND YOU DONT SEE THIS DOCOR!!!! 
4395,41006,0.0,"I was a patient with Dr. Glenda Lee for over 20 years. When I lost my job and health insurance I was told not to waste my time coming back. I offered to pay cash for my visits, however Dr. Lee's office staff said I need not bother. I wrote a letter to Dr. Lee and never received a response back. I thought she was the best Dr. ever until I lost my health insurance, then I was insignificant and not valued as a patient for over 20 years. Very very sad........ "
4396,41006,0.0,"While Dr. Lee is a good doctor, her staff is horrible. They are rude, disrespectful, don't know much, and argue with you if you ask for something as simple as a doctor's note. Their billing department doesn't know what they're doing either; we switched insurance companies and they continually billed the old insurance company for a few months after, and overcharged us a few times. They also double booked an appointment of ours and said nothing about it except sorry, you get another doctor today. Overall, horrible service. "
4397,41006,0.0,"Dr. Lee is very nice and cheerful person. She always had time for my questions. She delivered my first baby. Thanks to her.    But, she doesn't have courteous staffs so I faced lots of problem in follow ups. I never got any proper answers on phone. You can rarely see smile on their face.    They don't have proper coordination with billing department. Several times I was charged extra and then I have to call them and correct it!! It was a big hassel for me.  "
4398,41006,0.0,She is very kind and sincere.  Really listens and takes as much time as is necessary.  Very knowledgable.

4401,41008,0.0,"This doctor was somewhat nice, her staff was the best! Friendly and helpful. I wasn't crazy about Dr. Leonhardt herself, but I think that was just a personality clash between us. the main thing that turned me off about her office was the age! it REALLY needs updating. It is old, old, old!!! And I felt dirty when I was in there. so I left. I was sad though because the office girls were the best. I really miss them. I would recommend this doctor if you don't thave issues with old buildings and old decor, otherwise, she was ok.  "
4402,41009,1.0,Dr.LaVora is a very genuine physician with incredible bedside manners. He has related well to my 14 year old daughter who he has been treating for the past year.

4404,41009,1.0,"Dr Lavora is an outstanding individual and doctor.  Extremely personable, does not rush out of the exam room until you and he are satisfied with the treatment and his explanation.  "

4408,41009,1.0,The doctor really cares. He took the time to explain to me my problems and felt comfortable after I left. I really liked his follow up letter from the office.  
4409,41010,0.0,"I saw Dr. Latterel for several years. She always took my health very seriously. She listened to my concerns and never put me off. She saw me as I was trying to get pregnant, and all through both of my pregnancies. I had a miscarriage that was misdiagnosed (as a health pregnancy)and she helped me through that as well. When I was in labor with my daughter, I saw her for maybe 30 seconds. She was apparently leaving for a conference that day and had to go &quot;get her hair done&quot; so she missed the birth of my daughter. My family and I were a little put off by her priorities, but we continued to see her for the care of my daughter until her practiced moved 3 years later. "
4410,41010,0.0,"She looks like she just left med school, but she is helpful and accomodating. My first visit with her was not great, she was rushed and had her hand on the doorknob the whole time. Since then she's been better, and she really empathizes with my problems and was willing to explore multiple treatment options with me. "
4411,41011,1.0,"Dr. Leek is a very nice doctor. He was in no hurry and explained my back problem very thoroughly. A lot of my family and friends suggested Dr. Leek and I am glad to have meet him. Unfortunately my back did not respond to the epidural shots. Doctor Leek put all he could into trying. I like his wonderful sense of humor and that in its self made me feel comfortable. Thank you, Dr. Leek.  "
4412,41011,1.0,Great doc to see. listened well and explained everything to me.  
4413,41011,1.0,Went in as new patient with history of diagnosed painful health problems. This doctor told me he didn't think I was in any pain and refused any treatment with me. Can you imagine that&#63; But he sure was quick to send me a bill. This is a doctor in for the money and nothing else. Something should be done with these types of doctors. They should not be allowed to send bill for refusing to treat patients with known health problems. I don't even think he read my medical history! 
4414,41012,0.0,she is very kind and always on time. I really liked her 
4415,41013,1.0,"Dr Lanzer deserves a gold star. He really is a talented doctor. I had some cosmetic surgery done including face work and some body liposuction and found him to be very generous with his time and very patient (I need things clearly and slowly explained  - and he did this with a smile). I was nervous to go in , but from the moment I did step into the surgery I was made to feel really at ease. My results are impressive. Everyone comments on how much younger I look - I feel the same way too! - Thank you Dr Lanzer. I was also so impressed by how someone from his office called me after to make sure I was happy and had any questions. I would not hesitate to suggest anyone of my friends or family to be treated by Dr Lanzer - he is a wonderful caring doctor, the best! "
4416,41014,1.0,"I'm 25 years old suffering from chronic pain for 5 years.  I've had pointless surgeries and seen so many specialists who have done nothing but shove me back into Physical Therapy and take multiple MRIs, CTScans, and x-rays.  Dr. Leonard was the first doctor to take time and really look over me.  He knew what he was doing and now after 6 years of pain I'm about to get the treatment I need. "
4417,41014,1.0,"Kind,  caring, hard working doctor that truly cares about your recovery.  He is an asset to his profession. "

4419,41015,0.0,"Dr Leslie is an amazing doctor! He found that my daughter had hip dysplasia within hours of her being born. With him finding this made the difference of her being able to walk, run and play vs a life with many difficulties! He is kind and comforting and very down to earth.

4422,41017,1.0,"My whole family goes to this dentist, and though I now live 70 miles away from Jackson, I refuse to consider anyone else.  Dr. LaBudde and his staff are extremely patient and attentive (several of the ladies on staff helped me plan my wedding!).  Their new facility is nice and though they do not have laser cleaning, I've always gotten the impression that the staff makes an effort to stay up-to-date.  You have to make appointments several months in advance - they are always busy - but in all the years I've been going here they never seem to be running late.  I can honestly say I've never minded going to the dentist and it's because of these hygienists (especially Leah) and Dr. LaBudde. "
4423,41018,1.0,"Dr. LeMarbre is a kind and knowledgable oncologist.  I never feel rushed during an  appointment.  My only negative thought may be that he is difficult to reach on the phone. He always has his nurse follow up on calls rather than returning them himself. Besides that, I would recommend him as a gentle, understanding doctor.  "
4424,41019,1.0,"Very knowledgable.   Direct, but good bedside manner.   Sat and listened to everything I said going through each and every ailment and had direct solutions for each problem.  Would recommend to anyone.  "

Her nurse Ruth know.s more about HIV then a lot of doctors. When gives you a vaccination you will hardly feel a thing. She took care of a partner to the end of his life and he trust he more then the specialist she refereed him to for his eyes. She might be small on stature but she helped me stand tall.  Her education is impressive, her level of experience is extensive she is frequently consulted by other medical professionals. You will not wait too long (without an explanation)  She will take complicated HIV medication and help you make sense of them. She knows that one of the most important traits of long term survival is a partnership and you taking an an active role in planning your care.  "

4433,41023,1.0,"VERY rude to myself and family. insensitive to area being treated and was willing to burn area, without offering any alternatives to reduce scarring, pain. Lehman suggested we seek second opinion, but then prevented any of the other specialists from seeing us, after he contacted them. "

4445,41028,1.0,"VERY good doctor. I have had him since I was born, and now my daughter goes to him. He's such a good, caring, informative, and nice doctor who really loves what he does and cares genuinely about his patients. He also cares about costs. When our daughter was in the hospital, he told them to clear the room of equiptment that wasn't being used so we wouldn't be charged for it. He is an amazing doctor, and he daughter, Amy Lautz is also a great doctor in pediatrics. I recommend them both HIGHLY.  "

4449,41031,2.0,"No Medicine for pain, I had body aches, sore throat, STREP throat and was giving Lidocaine which made me throw up every time. Cough syrup is what you give to a strep throat person which helps both the body aches and the painful throat - duh I was treated badly - I'm 43 yrs old like I would go get STREP THROAT just to get cough syrup. There is no reason why I should be in pain!!! "

4454,41032,1.0,"I had a very bad experience with Dr. Lasser.  He recommended a treatment plan that I believe was the most convenient for him and was not in my best interest, and a second opinion from another doctor confirmed this.  I felt like he was rude and condescending to both me and my husband.  He made me feel uncomfortable and I would not recommend him to anyone. "

I know if I ask a question I'll get an honest answer.  Would, and have, recommended her.  "
4458,41033,0.0,DR. LAMPING DID NOT RECOGNIZE A SERIOUS ILLNESS I HAD DESPITE MY COMPLAINTS AND CONCERNS.  I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS DOCTOR.  SHE WAS EXTREMELY AROGANT AND DISRESPECTFUL.  +

After those results I asked for another meeting w/Dr. Laibly, hoping he might consider less radical treatment for an issue they couldn't even guarantee was giving us problems. Unfortunately, my follow up was one of the most awful experiences of my life. I was inthe middle of a miscarriage &amp; treated rudely &amp; disrespectfully. When I asked about an alternative treatment plan, I was immediately crushed and told that he didn’t want to “spend his weekends doing IUIs”, even though that wasn’t even what I was asking for.  I was told I had no other options and that I needed to go home and talk to my husband about IUI or IVF. At end of our “consultation” I was told “I don’t want to see you again until you’re pregnant”.  He was unkind, uncaring &amp; unwilling to provide care for me. "
4461,41034,1.0,WONDERFUL! He solved the mystery of my pain! We performed a perfect surgery and was there for me every step of the way! I only wish I didn't have to leave him (due to insurance change).  He has been the best dr I've ever had! 
4462,41034,1.0,"This doctor is amazing he really listens to the patient. I had an ongoing problem for over 10 years of my life living with pain Dr. Shawn Liably is the best doctor that I have found, He treated me like a human being not a number.Listens to patient and talks with you about your problem didnt just hand me a prescription and tell me take the pills... VERY HAPPY and WOULDNT TRADE HIM FOR A DOCTOR FOR ANYTHING "
4463,41034,1.0,"Dr.Laibly was my surgeon for a hysterectomy in Jan. 2009.  He takes the time to listen and involves you in your healthcare management.  Very professional, very caring and very respectful of his patient's choices. The reason I rated a 4 on punctuality is because I always had to wait to be seen..but I didn't mind because I know how he is...he gives his patient that extra time and answers all questions. I never felt that he was rushed to get to the next patient.   Wholeheartedly recommend this doctor! "

4467,41037,2.0,. Very Helpfull 
4468,41038,1.0,"Dr. Ladwig was the first doctor that I felt actually listened to my questions/concerns.  He remembered who I was personally after one visit and made sure that I left his office feeling confident in what was happening with my injury.  His actions have made me decide to find a new primary doctor within St. Luke's, feeling that I will be taken care of by any doctor within the hospital with the same level of excellent care.  "
4469,41038,1.0,"Was 1 hour and 10minutes waiting in the exam room.  Came in asked some questions, ordered xray, told me I should have injection. Never explained it, said it would help, never really had hands on my knee except to decide where to inject it.  Was in extreme pain following injection. Called office, and was initially told that was normal to experience discomfort following injection.  Discomfort is one thing extreme severe pain another.  Cannot recommend his services- "
4470,41038,1.0,I recently had complex knee surgery by Dr Ladwig. He was very explicit in describing the surgery and the recovery time and therapy. I've also had other surgeries with him that were compeletely successful and afforded me the opportunity to continue to lead a relatively active lifestyle.  His reputation with other doctors I've consulted with is excellent; often these doc say they would use him themselves for surgeries similar to mine. I recommend him very highly for his skills and williness to expain procedures to the patient. 
4471,41038,1.0,"Dr Ladwig is very skilled and professional. I had a difficult and complicated surgery with him that other surgeons were unwilling to touch, as I had multiple fractures.  He has an excellent reputation among other docs. He is known as the doc to go to if nobody else can fix you. Very prompt and on time. Returned weekend calls quickly. Highly recommended.  "
4472,41038,1.0,"Excellent Surgeon, I had a right total knee replacement.  No problems at all.  My husband saw Doc Ladwig for a right rotator cuff surgery with excellent results.  Again, no problems at all.  I would say that Dr. Ladwig is a gifted Surgeon, my husband and I were very blessed to have him as our Surgeon.  Would recommend him very highly. "
4473,41038,1.0,dr. ladwig spent time explaining what was wrong and how to best remedy the pain.  on all of my appointments he was within minutes of the scheduled time and never seemed to be rushing me out 
4474,41038,1.0,Excellent surgeon.  Very professional and through.  Highly recommended.  
4475,41038,1.0,This doctor was rude with an attitude! UNPERSONABLE and seemed to be uncaring! Staff couldn't get appointment correct! 
4476,41038,1.0,"Dr. Ladwig is quiet.  I had arthroscopy of my knee.  He did not tell me what my recovery would be like, but I didn't ask pre-op.  My fault.  He answered all my &#63;'s post-op.  Arthroscopy is a slow heal.  Google it.  Everybody heals differently, based on what's been done, and individual healing.  Dr. L did respond to concerns and returned phone call when I had a &#63; pre-op.  Be sure to get crutches if you have arthroscopy.  I felt good the day after surgery, but the 2nd post-op day was the worse.  I would ho back to Dr. Ladwig.  For surgeons priority is skill over bedside manner.  Great if you can get both.  Dr. Ladwig has a good reputation in the community.  When on this site, keep in mind that people are more apt to get vocal about their gripes than they are about their satisfaction.  MD was willing to review my MRI and show me what he did in surgery.  It's YOUR job to ask &#63;'s.  Go to appt. prepared.  You won't be disappointed if you ask &#63;'s.  His staff is great.  They go above & beyond.  "
4477,41038,1.0,"I agree with others, post-op care was dismissive and inattentive.  Overall v. disappointed w/ Dr. Ladwig, he didn't seem to care much and never accepted my input as relevant in his diagnoses, which ended up batting 1 for 3 as 2 diagnoses were way off.  If you're going to visit Dr. Ladwig, don't make any decisions w/o a 2nd opinion. "
4478,41038,1.0,"Dr. Ladwig performed a orthopedic scope surgery to remove a loose body from my knee.  After 4 weeks I continued to have discomfort, swelling and instability in my knee.  After nearly falling 3 times in one day I went to see him.  He told me nothing was wrong.  The next week I fell and caused severe nerve damage to my leg.  He began to tell me that I wasnt having any pain and it was normal recovery.  From my knee to my toes I had no sensation for a week.  This was the worst experience with a doctor I have ever had in my life. "
4479,41038,1.0,"Excellent surgeon; however, I was not satisfied with his post operative care. Also, he was unable to advise me how to proceed when the initial surgery was unsuccessful. "
4480,41039,0.0,"I was a patient of hers for 25 yrs.I have no idea what those low reviews are talking about.She is caring and friendly. She will spend as much time with you as needed. She is tenacious when trying to find a cause of your physical complaints. She may seem curt and in a hurry because she is fast talking, but that is her type A personality. I moved out of state 2 yrs ago and can't find a Dr here half as caring or smart.I really miss having her for my physician.  "
4481,41039,0.0,Did not help me with my problem had to ask my OBGYN for help and it wasn't even his field of expertise..did not seem to care what my symptoms were just to give me pills that didn't help and send me off.  Not very connected with patients. 
4482,41039,0.0,I have been seeing Dr Langlois for over 15 years and my parents have been going to her much longer.  She promptly returns phone calls and is curteous and extremely helpful and sympathetic to the needs of her patients.  
4483,41039,0.0,She is a very cold hearted and cruel doctor. She does not seem to mind killing old and helpless people in nursing homes. She does not allow them to get proper medical care to keep them alive.  
4484,41040,1.0,"We finally found a doctor that truly cares and is willing to listen to our needs. Other doctors in the past have completely dismissed many signs and symptoms that unfortunately wasted a year of our time. Dr. Lebovic is extremely prompt and very detailed.  I love that you can communicate with him directly through email or by phone.  Every time I have contacted him, he has responded in less than 20 minutes.  Even though we are not pregnant yet, I cannot say enough about how wonderful Dr. Lebovic is with his patients.  We trust him 100% and this has helped us stay calm and stress free through this difficult journey. "
4485,41040,1.0,My husband and I thought Dr. Lebovic was very professional. We had a tubal reversal done in April. He answered all of our questions and was very helpful. He is a soft spoken and gentle doctor. We trusted him completely. We had several visits with him prior to and following surgery and found his mannerisms to be consistent and professional. Although we are not pregnant yet we hope to be soon. We wouldn't have the possibility without Dr. Lebovic and his great staff. 
4486,41040,1.0,Dr. Lebovic was quiet and professional. My husband and I were very nervous about tubal reversal surgery. The Doctor answered all of our questions and helped to set our minds at ease. The surgery went well and was affordable considering our insurance did not cover the procedure. We had to visit the office several times before the surgery and we were always greeted by a friendly staff and great nurses. We hope to soon be pregnant and thank the entire staff and especially Doctor Lebovic for the professional care. 
4487,41040,1.0,My wife and I went to every reproductive specialist in the Madison area and Dr. Lebovic is the only one who took the time to answer all our questions and made my wife and I feel relaxed and as if we finally had hope. 
4488,41040,1.0,"I saw Dr. Lebovic for removal of a large intramural leiomyoma. He performed a robotic myomectomy on me two weeks ago, and I am recovering very well. I met with two other doctors prior to meeting with him, but neither could offer this less-invasive, specialized procedure. In my experience, Dr. Lebovic is soft-spoken and serious, and demonstrates a thoughtful respect for his patients. He was very kind to me throughout, encouraging and answering questions, and he was available at each step -- before the signing of the consent form, pre/post-surgery and at the follow-up visit. His staff are also helpful and compassionate. I felt very well-cared for, and feel fortunate to have had him as my surgeon. "
4489,41040,1.0,Terrific bedside manner and overall superb care with wealth of knowledge base. 
4490,41040,1.0,We have been very happy with Dr. Lebovic's care. He may be quiet and reserved but he has gone out of his way to help us. We have a beautiful little baby because of Dr. Lebovic and his great staff. We have always felt that he put a great deal of thought into his decisions about our treatment and is vert cautious. We have gone back to Dr. Lebovic to assist us in getting pregnant again. He remembered who we were and once again we feel that he exudes professionalism and a great deal of knowledge. We really like Dr. Lebovic...don't mistake quiet for cold and uncaring. Dr. Lebovic has shown us on several occasions that he cares and wants us to succeed. 
4491,41040,1.0,"Dan was extremely helpful to my wife and I after we saw following my wife's second miscarriage. He is a bit reserved, but found him to be very caring. He was extremely generous with his time, e-mailing us with extended answers to our questions. He is very knowledgeable of the literature. If anything, we found him less pushy than we actually wanted him to be, giving us a significant latitude in how we wanted to proceed (entirely the opposite of the other reviewer). I have, very enthusiastically, advised two other couples to seek him out. "
4492,41040,1.0,I did not feel comfortable with this doctor during my visit. It was obvious to me that he did not want me to ask questions. He was somewhat rude and dismissive when I did ask questions. He was extremely cold and clinical. I would not trust him with my care and requested another doctor. I was shocked that someone who is an infertility specialist would not have even a shred of kindness or understanding for what women are going through. It was obvious to me that he had none. 
4493,41040,1.0,"He was someone I didn’t trust. He pushed me toward a surgery that I didn’t ultimately need. He was rude to my husband when my husband voiced concerns about the surgery and it was my husband and I that actually pushed for the course of action that resulted in the conception of our child. With the doctor’s plan, I would have had surgery and it would have done me no good.  "
4494,41041,0.0,Best Psycologist around!! Compassonate and caring... 
4495,41041,0.0,"This woman turned my life around with her compassion, intelligence, kindness, professionalism, and human connection. I've been to many counselors/psychologists, but no one anywhere close to as fantastic as this woman. In fact, I haven't ever needed counseling again; that's how profoundly her work affected me. Count your lucky stars if you live near enough to entrust your mental health to Dr. Lehman. You will NEVER find a better therapist. Never. Beth D. "
4496,41042,1.0,Very expensive treatment that did not get to the cause of the problem. He does not answer calls after hours - even if the medication he prescribed is making the patient sick. 
4497,41042,1.0,Limited treatment options considered. Little consideration of patient input. 
4498,41043,0.0,Nice bedside manner. She's intelligent and doesn't rush you.  
4499,41044,0.0,"My wife is a pediatrician, and this is the guy that she picked saying &quot;hands down...no question.&quot;  I don't much like doctors, but this guy is such a special doc that you don't feel stupid asking questions, and you NEVER feel belittled.  He is unbelievably intelligent, but more than that he just loves kids (and even parents too, I think). "
4500,41044,0.0,"I have an almost two year old, and we've been going to Dr. Leach since she was born. He makes new parents feel confident and at ease! He listens to his patience and his sense of humor makes going to the Dr. less of a pain. The staff on the other hand is often less then helpful and at times even rude. Sometimes it's difficult to see him on short notice (as if you can tell he is a popular doctor) but there are always doctors in his clinic that can see my daughter if need be. I would recommend Dr. Leach and can't imagine seeing anyone else! "
4501,41044,0.0,The best doctor by far - one of his best attributes is that he does not have &quot;knee jerk&quot; reactions to you childs ills and other problems. He is very judicious in presribing meds. He does just walk in ask what you &quot;think&quot; is wrong and prescribe something for your child just to get you out of there.  GREAT DOC! 
4502,41044,0.0,"Dr. Leach is the best doctor for children as well as their parents.  As first time parents, he made the appointments fun and non-threatening for us, he is always open to questions and helped us think through making appointments affordable because our insurance doesn't cover anything.  Our son loves to go to him and and always says &quot;He's silly, isn't he, Mom&#63;&quot;  He has never been scared of going to the Dr. because Dr. Leach just isn't scary.  His staff is excellent and most helpful when calling in with questions.  One nurse called us several times a day to check on our son, and helped us through an illness so that we never needed to go to the office.  I just can't say enough about Dr. Leach! "
4503,41044,0.0,Dr. Leach's knowledge along with his sense of humor makes him very approachable. He's great with both of my kids (boy and girl) 
4504,41044,0.0,"I started going to Dr. Leach when I was 4 mths old and got my last appt in a few months before I turned 18 and am extremely disappointed I cant continue to see him. He is very helpful, friendly, and knows how to LISTEN. He always took what my mom told him seriously and treated her like she knew what was going on with her child. I recommend anyone I know who has children to him, because he is just that great. He also works closely with Children's Hospital of Wisconsin. "
4505,41045,2.0,"Kind, gentle, not dictatorial, tries to meet patient's needs and desires; very current with techniques and approaches.  "
4506,41045,2.0, 
4507,41048,0.0, Dr Saitis is very nice and she know her staff very well. I will recomend her to my friends.  
4508,41051,1.0," Go some where else.. Find yourself a real Doctor to take care of you. These are anesthesiologist. If you do go here, Good Luck...  "
4509,41051,1.0," The staff is kind and helpful. Dr.Saini is knowledgeable,kind and friendly. The treatments I have been receiving for my neck and lower back are very helpful and are working to relieve my pain.  "
4510,41051,1.0, They have the friendliest staff and everyone is very helpful. The doctor and his assistant took thier time and I felt that they really listened to my concerns and answered questions.  I had a procedure done and Dr. Sani made it absolutely painless.  I've never been treated more gently or kindlier!! 
4511,41051,1.0, He said &quot;Americans do not tolerate pain well.&quot;  Draw your own conclusions as to the torture you will endure.  
4512,41051,1.0,.   
4513,41051,1.0," Amazing, perfect, beautiful.   He did so much to help out. It was very helpful. He is a very good doctor.  "
4514,41051,1.0," Dr Saini was very helpful in diagnosing my pain. After the birth of my first child, I had extreme pain from my back going down to my legs. He diagnosed the cause and performed an injection. It took three injections, more than I would have wished, but I'm pain free today. He was a little late, but I was told when I came in that he was running behind. I've been to many doctors offices and the vast majority run behind, I was thankful the staff alerted me when I came in. I did see Earl, I didn't feel he was rude, a little short, but he explained everything very well.  "
4515,41051,1.0, Dr. Saini's P.A. Earl Beam has poor communication skills with patients... has no &quot;patience&quot; with us. Then Dr. Saini chooses to try to &quot;smooth things over&quot; but then plays games with you and your medication.  
4516,41051,1.0," Very arrogant and unprofessional. Demanded a complete history out of a patient on valium and Vicodin. Anybody knows when on a new pain med the patient maybe confused and can not give a detailed, accurate history. Rude and worked for the enemy company that caused the work damage to the patient. All treatments were useless and extremely painful. Never admitted the patient had two blown discs to cover-up for the hospital. I would drive to another state before I would see this criminal. "
4517,41061,1.0," Dr. Daniel Sajdak is the best doctor i have ever been to all the way around.  will listen and evaluate according to your symptoms, try to find the problem and look things up to be sure of medications being appropriate...etc. "
4518,41061,1.0, He is a really caring doctor who explains things well. Like him for our whole family. 
4519,41065,2.0, Great doctor. Very helpful and friendly. Highly recommend this doctor. 
4520,41071,1.0, The doctor's hands were very shakey during our ER visit. My 11 year old son needed stitches...he ended up having staples instead. He gave shakey shots to numb the area and stapled before it was even numb!!! Then he had to redo one of the staples. The staples are still in very poorly.  Maybe he was havng a bad day but he was not friendly! 
4521,41085,0.0," Tara was great with the birth of our child. She was very sensitive to our needs and was caring, professional, and personable. We'd definitely go see her again.  "
4522,41088,2.0, excellent clinician highly recommended and extremely knowledgeable who has great listening and communication skills Paid/Co-pay:$50
4523,41090,2.0," This was a hernia repair and, although expensive (what else is new about health care &#63;), Dr. Salaymeh did an excellent job. Minimal discomfort, little followup required and most important, no post-op infection. Paid/Co-pay:$12000"
4524,41100,0.0, Dr Sabo was my doctor throughout a stressful yet wonderful pregnancy.  I loved having her there while my son was born. 
4525,41100,0.0," Most wonderful doc you could find, called me at home during a difficult time just to check in.  Problem is not accepting new patients and only OB now.  If we could just clone her... "
4526,41100,0.0, I *heart* Dr. Sabo.  She is a really great doctor.  
4527,41100,0.0, She is very caring.  she was wonderful after a lost my daughter last year at 38 weeks.  she is just a wonderful doctor and i definately recommend her to anyone. 
4528,41115,1.0," I have never felt so little until meeting this doctor. Didn't bother to even talk or ask questions. He was literally in the room no longer than 5 minutes.  Told me he didn't know what was wrong and it didn't pay to look at the MRI because the radiologist didn't see anything so neither would he.  Said if thought of anything he would give us a call and showed us the door.  But, he did have the time however to call the short-term disability office to let them know he wouldn't be filling out any papers for me so I could get payed while i was off.  The only people who were friendly were the Medical Assistant who brought me into the room and the receptionist at the desk.  He was unbelievably rude and wouldn't recommend him to ANYONE.  "
4529,41129,2.0, This guy is thorough and eager to help.  Found a tear in my shoulder tendon many others missed.  A+ 
4530,41134,1.0," I don't normally see Dr. Saikie, however he was the doctor on call the weekend I had my daughter.  He came to my room the next day and spent time checking me over and seemed to really care about how I was feeling.  "
4531,41134,1.0," Dr. Saikie was wonderful. He isn't one to induce for non-medical reasons (which I think is a plus - he obviously cares about the well-being of both patients and won't induce because it's trendy). His specialty is high-risk pregnancies, although mine was routine. My husband liked him - they would talk and talk about music. On a smaller note, Dr. Saikie always helped me up from the examination table but when I visited a female doctor in the practice, she didn't. It was a small but appreciated gesture, especially since sitting up is a luxury lost after the first few months of pregnancy. He is very personable.  I would highly recommend him! "
4532,41136,1.0,"I liked Dr. Thompson. He did a very thorough exam and notates everything with some dental software program.  Very competent.  Very friendly.  But when I had my teeth cleaned, the hygienist left the office door wide open!  I felt like I was on display for every Tom Dick & Harry who strolled down the hallway.   I don't know why I didn't say something -- next time I will :) "
4533,41137,0.0,"My son never cried at a doctor appointment (other than vaccinations) until I met Dr. Taylor.  I saw her for 3 appointments, starting when my son was about 18 months.  At his final appointment with him she pulled back his foreskin so hard that he was screaming in pain.  Ever since this episode he would barely let us wipe him at diaper changes.  I found her bedside manner to be lacking.  I also didn't appreciate the manner in which she talked to us as the parents.  I felt her to be somewhat condescending, and not in tune with the parents' wishes in their child's healthcare and raising.  I raised concerns several times over feeling like my son was getting vaccines that he'd already had, and felt railroaded into just accepting them.  Personally, I would never recommend her to someone else.  Her nurses were always friendly, though. "
4534,41138,1.0,"I've been going to Dr. Tipple for over 10 years. I've never had a negative experience, everyone is very nice and I feel I have a very healthy mouth due to their their watchful eye. Dr. Tipple checks in at every dental cleaning just to see how things are going and alert me to any upcoming issues.  "
4535,41138,1.0,"Dr. Tipple is very personable, talkative, and I have had a much better experience with him than with my previous dentists.  His staff - front desk, hygenists - are first-rate too.  "
4536,41139,1.0,I have been a patient of Dr. Toonen's for  over 20 years and have always had excellent care from Dr. Toonen and his staff. The front desk goes out of their way to help me understand my insurance benefits and finding appointments which fit into my schedule.  The staff is friendly and makes me feel at ease. I feel they offer a great service at a competitive price. I actually don't mind going to the dentist.  Debbie Millies  Thanks sis  I appreciate it  Linda 
4537,41139,1.0,"I am so happy to have found Dr. Toonen and his office since I have had dental issues all my adult life going to the dentist is not my favorite thing to do.  The staff at Dr. Toonens office has made it enjoyable, they have always been helpful and patient with my concerns and fears.  The dental work I have been extremely happy with all the dental wark I have had done here.  I have been a patient for over 10 years and would not think of changing offices.  "
4538,41139,1.0,"Staff was unbelievable rude, and flat out lied about what I could expect from them.  I am sad that a place like this is out there.  My experience with this office has been the worst service experience I have had with any provider before. "
4539,41140,1.0,he is very caring and a pleasure to be around. he actually trys to help figure out whats wrong. I have always felt 100% cared for there.  
4540,41141,0.0,"Great doctor! Good listener, very nice, nonjudgmental, and extremely competent. Highly recommend. "
4541,41141,0.0,"Dr. Torgersen is fantastic! She is very nice, super helpful and understanding.  I had never been to this clinic before and choosing her for my Dr. was a great decision!!!  I will definitely be keeping her and having her as our family doctor! "
4542,41142,2.0,Very helpful in helping me understand what is going on with my teeth and why I'm having the pain I have. I thought I needed root canels but was instructed I need a mouthgard for TMJ issues.  Staff was very friendly and helpful. Recommendations and treatment have helped these issues. 
4543,41143,2.0,Explained all options of care very well. Always willing to squeeze you in if medically needed. Wonderful bedside manners.  
4544,41143,2.0,"not very informative, doesn't seem knowledgable with brain injury issues, patient has to be well informed with meds and issues....  "
4545,41144,1.0,I think Dr. Thompson is the best!  He explains procedures.   His staff is awesome! 
4546,41145,1.0,Dr Tjarksen is a great doctor he was refered to me from my family doctor.  He offered me many options to fix my back and i picked surgery thanks and having surgery the 23rd of august 
4547,41145,1.0,I had used Dr Tjarksen for a neck issue. I had been in pain for several months before being refered to him. He was fast in making a determination on the root cause of my pain. He originaly scheduled my surgery out 3-4 months but after watching me walk toward the lobby he called me back and rescheduled my surgery for the following week. I found him very knowlegedable and helpful. The operation was a complete success and I wish I hadn't put it off for so long as I did. I haven't felt this good in years.  
4548,41145,1.0,"Dr. Tjarksen performed a 4 hour, 4 level spinal fusion with discectomy on my 74 year old mother in Jan '10.  He is incredibly caring, kind, polite, knowledgeable, willing to listen, and most importantly, highly skilled!  My mom has since recommended Dr. Tjarksen to several friends who have all had a positive experience with him.  She is back riding her lawn mower 4 months after surgery.  Thank you Dr.  Tjarksen! "
4549,41145,1.0,"Saw him for neck pain suffered in a compression type injury.  Was in the room for 3 minutes, had me move my neck around then sent me for an x-ray.  Did not even have the decency to come back into the room afterwards.  Told his nurse to come in and tell me that he thought it was a strain.  I asked about pain meds and she had to go ask him.  She came back and said that with Physical Therapy, I won't need meds.  Cannot get into physical therapy for over a week.  HORRIBLE bedside manner!  I would never recommend to anyone.  "
4550,41145,1.0,Dr. Tjarksen is great! Very knowledgable.. He picked up my case from another doctor and is doing surgery and finishing up what I had done at a hospital that is out of network for my insurance. Thanks Dr.  T! 
4551,41145,1.0,Dr. Tjarksen did 3 major surgeries on my left hip and thigh. He has excellent beside manner in addition to great skills. He is honest and freely admits if your case is complicated beyond his expertise. (That was my situation.) He immediately had the name of another orthopedic specialist. Too many times I have not been given a referral by MDs. Too many doctors will not admit when they don't know what to do. Dr. T always took me seriously too.  
4552,41145,1.0,"Wouldn't order tests, said it wouldn't change his mind & refused to look at past test results. I have a history of major back problems & he was a waste of my time. I refuse to recommend anyone to him. Very arrogent & rude. "
4553,41145,1.0,This doctor was very patient and caring when I was asking lots of questions. He was always on time and he did a great job on my back. My recovery is going well. They make sure you have all the instructions in writing so you know what to do when you get home. Great communication! Thanks Dr. Tjarksen! 
4554,41145,1.0,"Dr. Tjarksen was wonderful!!! He diagnosed my back problem, giving me many options besides surgery to correct my problem. I still opted for surgery. He had me in for surgery within one week, and within a month I was back to &quot;normal&quot;. My followup visits were quick and very thorough. He took much interest in any questions that I had, he was wonderful to my family after surgery, answering any and all questions they had. He is always smiling and had a great &quot;bed side manner&quot;. I would definately recommend him to anyone. He gave me my life back!! Thank you Dr. T.!!! "
4555,41145,1.0,"Dr. Tjarksen was NOT at all helpfull to me when I saw him for neck and back pain. He was extremely arrogant and insinuated that my pain was in my head even though I had a MRI showing multiple disc herniations. Fortunately, I was able to find a doctor that treated me with respect and was actually able to help me.  "
4556,41145,1.0,I thought he was excellent! I was in so much pain that I could't bear to sit or stand. He saw me on Wednesday and had me in surgery by Saturday. I am pain free and recovered beautifully. He even called me at home personally to see how I was recovering. Very concerned and caring doctor. 
4557,41145,1.0,This Doctor saved me from a life of pain and misery...I think he is a wondeful doctor.  
4558,41145,1.0,Saw him for back pain I have had for 10 years and waited over an hour past appointement to see him. He was in the room for 5 minutes and told me I was fine and he could not help.  Terrible doctor 
4559,41146,1.0,I have been a patient of Dr. Tovar for 11 years. I was shocked to see the negative reviews. He delivered my two children and has operated on myself. The only issue I have is that his appointments often run 30 to 45 minutes late. After saying that I would have no problem recommending him.  
4560,41146,1.0,the staff is very unpleasant i felt as though i was getting a attitude from them everytime i asked a question or was asked to do somthing.  
4561,41146,1.0,When I went into labor 9 years ago...he was my doctor. To this day I still have horrible memories of that event. He never really wanted to tend to me. All he wanted to do was cut me up. He wanted out of there...because he had a scheduled appointment in the morning... I was in labor for 14 hours...and I remember him yelling at the nurse attending to me...about waking him up... I remember how upset he was...when I was in such tremendous pain. He didn't want to be there...and towards the middle of my labor...I didn't want him to be there either. Like I said he kept on wanting to cut me up...to get the labor over with. He was horrible. His partner finally came in and resued me. My baby had to be sucked out of my vagina. My vagina...ended up staying purple for over 3 years after the horrible incident. My husband and I thought I was going to die that day...if not both my baby and I. He was horrible... Horrible. I wouldn't even recommend him to my worst enemy. 
4562,41147,1.0,"Dr. Thomas is usually running behind, but that is because he is thorough and makes sure all your questions are answered.  He is worth the wait. "
4563,41147,1.0,Dr. Thomas is very knowledgeable and professional.  He takes the time needed to make sure you understand.  He cares about his patients and truly listens.  
4564,41148,2.0,Excellent doctor 
4565,41149,2.0,I have seen other Dr.'s that couldn't diagnose the problem with my hand/arm. Dr. Taylor made a quick diagnose and prescribed treatment that took care of the problem within a couple weeks.  I had been suffering with this condition for months. Best Dr. I have ever seen! (Cute too) 
4566,41150,0.0,"I have gone to Dr T for 11 years and she has delivered my three boys.   I love both her and Terry.   They are very friendly, professional, caring and I would not consider going anywhere else.  "
4567,41150,0.0,"I love Dr. Trebian. She is personable, kind and patient, with a great sense of humor. Even my husband (who distrusts most doctors) thinks she is fantastic. On the rare occasion she doesn't have an immediate answer, she will find it for me. Terri is a huge help in the office and very easy to talk with as well.  Great team! "
4568,41150,0.0,i was a patient of this doctor for many years. After having a tubal failure with this doctor and how she handled it i wouldnt go again nor would i recommend her to anyone.  
4569,41150,0.0,I love Dr. Trebian!  I wish I could see her for all my medical issues.  She helped me tremendously when I had post-partum issues.  
4570,41150,0.0,"WONDERFUL OB/GYN.  She really listened to what I wanted during my first pregnancy and was supportive of my choices during labor and delivery.   The office is small, so things stay on time which is great too! "
4571,41150,0.0,"I found Dr. Trebian completely on accident in my early 20's, and would recommend her to anyone who wants a female OBGYN who will listen to your concerns with genuine interest and care, without passing judgement (hey, we all make mistakes in our early 20's!).  There's a reason you practically have to book 6 months in advance to see her!  She's wonderful - highly recommended. "
4572,41150,0.0,"Dr. Trebian is very kind, personable, and knowledgeable.  She explains thing in a down-to-earth way without making you feel she is talking down to you.  Normally I dread going to the doctor, but she made me very comfortable.  "
4573,41150,0.0,"Dr. Trebian is the best. She's very friendly and thorough. She talks to me when I come in, she addresses my concerns and has diagnosed me quickly and accurately whenever anything was wrong. She's surprised me by calling me herself with test results. I trust her absolutely, and I don't DREAD going to see her. I'm lucky I found her.    (p.s. I actually have Trilogy Insurance now. ) "

4578,41150,0.0,"Fantastic doctor. She listens and values her patient's time as much as her own. As another medical professional, I appreciate her depth of knowledge and dedication to working as a partner with her patients. She also has a great personality and is very interested in the issues that women face in all aspects of health care. I can't recommend her highly enough. "
4579,41150,0.0,She recently delivered my first baby. Explains everything well and allowed me to give input regarding my care. Very friendly and seems to really care about her patients. 
4580,41151,1.0,Had total hysterectomy.he was very attentive and explained everything as he went.friendly.  
4581,41151,1.0,"Dr. Tiffany was a decent doctor for my annual exams...but once I got pregnant, he seemed to change completely.  Did not respect my choices regarding prenatal testing, did not seem concerned about my questions or concerns and only once asked me about any discomforts - my acne, so that he could try to sell me an expensive skin product that his office now prescribes.  I don't know what happened, as I used to really like him, but after my second prenatal appointment I chose not to return to his office due to his rudeness and unprofessional attitude.  I am concerned that someone who doesn't respect my wishes or concerns for my pregnancy would not care about those same things in labor and delivery. No thanks. I'll be having a home birth with a midwife, and Dr. Tiffany helped me make that decision.  "
4582,41151,1.0,"Dr. Michael tiffany was VERY VERY VERY rude and I would not recommend him to anyone I know, he didn't seem to care about anything, he asked me if I was a smoker I told him yes and he started to go on and on about quitting smoking and I told him im well aware, and when i recieved my bill in the mail he charged me $46.00 for talking about smoking when I didn't even ask to talk about it. Also he left to do a delivery without even telling me until his staff came in and asked me why i'm still here that he went to deliver a baby, and no one told me I was still waiting to be seen!!!!! "
4583,41151,1.0,"I had a very bad experience with Dr. Tiffany.  He was arrogant and rude and yelled at me while my blood pressure was high about my blood pressure.  At the end of my visit with him, he told me that I was not allowed to step foot in his clinic ever again, and believe me, I would not.  "
4584,41151,1.0,"Dr. Tiffany was very helpful and caring. He got along very well with my fiancée and of course myself. Next baby I have, I will go to him. He was no nonsense when it came to delivery, I ended up needing a C-Section, and as soon I was I told, I was in the operating room.  The staff is wonderful and caring, and I haven't had better! "
4585,41151,1.0,Dr. Tiffany is pretty cool. Like a caring brother. He did my hysterectomy and followed up with me professionally. I still see him outside of visits now and then and he takes the time to stop and say hi and ask how Im doing. I never had a GYNO Dr in my whole life until him and I like him.  
4586,41151,1.0,"Dr. Tiffany and his staff really care about his patients. He saved my baby's life as well as mine. I could not have more faith in, and respect for a doctor.  "
4587,41151,1.0,"Dr. Tiffany has been my Dr. for 5 years and he has always been very nice and professional, along w/his nurse. "
4588,41151,1.0,Dr Tiffany is a very good Dr. he is very sincere when it comes to his patients. He is very cautious and doesnt like doing unwanted surgery. But he has been very good with me and my family.  
4589,41152,2.0,Physician was abrupt with patient; seemed annoyed when asked to explain medication issues. Was not sympathetic to patient's inability to pay for expensive medical tests. Was unwilling to offer less-costly alternatives to tests. 
4590,41153,1.0,"I found him to be a very sincere doctor,and he spent a fair share of time with me.  It just seemed as though he used his computor too much instead of examining me but I did like him "
4591,41154,1.0,Excellent knowledge and diagnostic abilities.  Dr. Torres detected a blood clot in my leg that my orthopedic doctor had dismissed a day earlier.  He sent me directly to the hospital for treatment which most likely saved my life.  He seldom prescribes medication and encourages patients to take responsibility for staying healthy with good diet and exercise programs.  He will answer as many questions as I am prepared to ask and makes great referrals when I ask him to suggest a specialist for any reason.  
4592,41154,1.0,Takes advantage of the older generation. Pushes drugs not needed. Difficult to understand as he speaks poor english. His charges are way out of line and should be reported to medicare.  
4593,41155,2.0,"A complete waste of time, has no compassion.  Typical corporate medicine attitude.  No personal care at all.  "
4594,41156,0.0,"Rearranged her already full surgery schedule to the point of seriously inconveniencing herself, just to  accommodate my very narrow time frame for a necessary surgery, prior to my losing health insurance. Was genuinely concerned about my future health care options. Was thorough in examining xrays and MRI scans, explaining the problem I had, outlining my options, and explaining her surgical repairs.  Took photos during surgery to show me exactly how the repair was performed.  Saw me as many times as I needed to be seen post-surgically without any additional charges.  Made sure I had good pain control for months afterwards. Accommodates residents of the Winona, Minnesota area by traveling weekly from La Crosse to see them closer to their home. Is pleasant and personable. Her nurse is very consciencious and responded to me quickly, whenever I called with a question or problem. Honestly, I didn't have a single negative issue with her and will be using her services again in a few months.  "
4595,41156,0.0, 
4596,41157,1.0,"Dr. Tache handed me a prescription. When I asked him about potential aide effects, his response was that &quot;my face would stop hurting&quot;, said flippantly. Turns out the drug he prescribed is (a) habit-forming (b) can severely deform a fetus if pregnant and (c) can aggravate mental illness if it already exists. His response to my question was completely arrogant and irresponsible. I will never return to see any doc in this practice again.  "
4597,41158,0.0,"I was told after consulting with the doctor here that I was REQUIRED to do PT at this clinic and not at the clinic where my other specialist had already referred me (and was many miles closer to my home) or the doctor would not see me as a patient.  Hmmm, interesting since she has a financial interest in that PT business.  I did go for the PT assessment; there was no range of motion,the young lady argued with me, told me I was not going to have my 'exercise routine modified due to my knees being pretty terribly' (ACLs completely torn due to inflammation, surgeon just told me I needed both replaced, another trying to hold with steriod injections to quiet them).  There are things I cannot do; that aggravate them, like deep knee bends.  I was told I WOULD be doing whatever exercise routine they gave me without modification.  I chose to go elsewhere for PT. Dr King told me she would NOT see me as a patient simply because of that!  The staff are rude robots. They read prewritten scripts.  "
4598,41159,1.0,Dr Tange has been my doctor for greater than thiry years. He is excellent and his nursing staff is also excellent 
4599,41159,1.0, 
4600,41160,0.0,Dr. Peggy Tong is the most helpful dermatologist I have seen. I saw 5-6 dermatologists and they all tried to rush me out of the office without carefully listening to my symptoms/history and answering my questions. Dr. Peggy Tong took her time to answer all the questions with a smile. She is very knowledgeable. I had to make an appointment 2-3 months in advance to see her. But it's really worth it. Now I know why she's booked for 2-3 months in advance.  
4601,41160,0.0,"Dr. Tong and her staff were absolutely wonderful. Very professional, very helpful. I called the nurse to discuss a problem before my wedding. She called me back the next day just to see how the problem was doing. They went above and beyond the call of duty. Although very busy, Dr. Tong makes time to listen to your questions and respond fully. All of her nurses are wonderful, too! I can't recommend her highly enough "

4606,41163,0.0,Great Doctor listened to everything i had to say and very compasonate.  Will defenitly see her again! 
4607,41163,0.0,"Does not listen to patient. Shrugs off any complaints I had as,&quot; You're at that age&quot; and in turn missed a condition I have had for 2 yrs. that was finally diagnosed when I insisted on a referral to a specialist. I am getting a new primary care physician.  "
4608,41163,0.0,"I am very thankful for this doctor. She may not always be the most friendly. she saved my son's life by diagnosing a heart condition that could have cost him his life at a routine doctors appt. She also has a strange sense of humor, but so do I at times, so I find her enjoyable and look forward to my visits.  "
4609,41163,0.0,"Dr. Thomsen does not listen to her patients, and I ended up going to another doctor the same day I saw her to receive treatment for a simple sinus infection and ear infection.  If you are looking for a doctor, I would keep looking.  We went to her a few times as our family doctor, and we were never impressed.  This last visit was too much, and we are finally going to look for a new doctor.  "
4610,41164,0.0,Very pleased. Dr Takata has the best patient manner I have ever seen. Very easy to talk to and her staff is great. I would recommend her without reservation. I feel confident that she cares and has my best interests at heart.

4613,41166,1.0,The staff is helpful and he took the time to explain treatment to me. 
4614,41166,1.0,"This doctor is not professional, and unclean office and patient rooms. He took an oath and he dont abide by it.  "
4615,41167,1.0,"Dr. Taylor was my Dr. from the late 1990s to the mid-2000s. When I changed insurance carriers through work, I wad to choose another physician. When I was again able, I chose Dr. Taylor again. I trust few medical professionals, but I have always felt Dr. Taylor has the holistic health of the patient in mind, he is very knowledgable, asks very pointed questions, and in several cases, where he did not know the answer to something, told me he would find it, and did within a matter of hours. There are not enough people like him.  "
4616,41167,1.0,"He has been my doc for almost 20 years and we have gone through many illness.  He is always so kind, has empathy and very knowledgable!! "
4617,41167,1.0,"Wonderful Christian man, really cares for his patients. "
4618,41167,1.0,It is rare to have a physician truly LISTEN as well as this one did. 
4619,41168,2.0,"Excellent care of my problems, very patient, caring, and understanding. "
4620,41169,0.0,"I first met this doctor shortly after my first on was born. She was always kind, and understanding of all I didn't know as a new mom.She was my rock at times when I was at a loss on how to make my children better whenever they seemed to be sick.She remained my go to person for all three of my kids. Always welcoming, and always willing to teach,not judge.Show, not push away. My kids are now 16,13,9 and to this day they love all she did for them. ;) "
4621,41170,1.0,"Great doctor. Helpful, listens, does appropriate tests, gets to the bottom of your issues. He can get behind schedule a bit, but that is because he is actually helping his patients. "
4622,41170,1.0,"When no other doctor would attempt to help me, he offered his services, and became a good trusted friend. He has an excellent empathetic manner, and encouraged my involvement in my own healing process.  "
4623,41171,1.0,"I foune this doctor to be exceptiionally knowlegable, very personable and proficient. I was more impressed by this Dr more than any other that I have had treat me in my entire 73 year life.  He is FANTASTIC!!! "
4624,41172,0.0,"Dr. Tanel is excellent in dealing with patients like me with multiple health problems. She remembers details of my various conditions and follows up accordingly. She shines when it comes to diagnostics, and the specialists with whom she consults have been stellar. Her staff of nurses, nurse practitioners and physician assistants are well-trained professionals; I trust them as well. I've been Dr. Tanel's patient for almost 20 years, and would leave her only if I relocated.  "
4625,41172,0.0,"Dr  Tanel has been on target for any symptoms I have discussed with her.   She is attentive, knowledgabls and returns any of my calls with question, promptly "
4626,41173,1.0,"I worked on a professional level with Dr. Timmermans before he becamse my PCP at the beginning of the year.  He has always been treating my symptoms seriously.  He is very wordy which is fun and takes the mind off of whatever I'm suffering.  Never condescendanting if I don't like a med he's suggesting, we work as a true doctor-patient team (I have a Medical bacground as well) .  Only negative is his nurse Wilma.  I've learned to get on her good side, but she does abruptly slam the door on your face after she has done her initial assessment.  She really takes a lot to open up.  Overall, I am very satisfied  I am espacially pleased by the ease of getting documentation to my employer for FMLA for 2 days of excruciating pain. "
4627,41173,1.0,"I cannot say enough about the excellent care that I received from Dr. Timmermans and his staff. The procedure that was required was explained in great detail which made the surgery easier to deal with.  The follow-up after the surgery was exceptional. I couldn’t believe that this man took the time to call my home to ensure we had made it home safely without any complications. Wow, you’re in safe hands with Dr. Timmermans and his team. "
4628,41173,1.0,Dr. Timmermans has been willing to go the extra mile to care for me and my family and really works hard to get us the care we need within the guidelines of our insurance company. He has excellent followup and really seems to care.  
4629,41174,1.0,"Knowledgeable and caring. Whenever i consulted him, his diagnosis we accurate insightful and to the point. "
4630,41174,1.0,"My daughter saw Dr. Temple for appx. 4 years for migraines and partial seizures but he neglected to do any type of a head scan. When we went ahead and did a head scan on our own, we discovered that a brain tumor was causing the headaches and seizures. When I wrote Dr. Temple a letter explaining why we would no longer be seeing him I received no response.  "
4631,41175,2.0,. The very best 
4632,41176,1.0,"I just had my second son and Dr. Taylor has always taken time to listen to my numerous concerns and questions and although a quiet man is easily approachable and I have always been able to talk to him with ease.  He told me exactly what to expect when I had to see a specialist because of a spot appearing on the ultrasound; including my chances of having a child with downs and was extremely considerate of my feelings.  With my second son I was to have a planned c-section and my son decided he would come early.  Dr. Taylor had the day off but talked to me on the phone and came in on his day off to deliver my baby.  He did a great job with both surgeries and checking in after.  Dr. Taylor has always been very open to our decisions, took time to listen and has a good bed side manner. "
4633,41176,1.0,"This needs more insurance choices or a &quot;none&quot; option.  He's not a warm, friendly, personable guy, but I felt I was in good hands.  I had PIH with my son, and I thought my care was managed very well.  Never did I feel like something more should have been done. "
4634,41176,1.0,"I saw Dr. Taylor during my pregancy with my first child. During my prenatal visits he often seemed as if he weren't listening to me and that I had to remind him of things.  The final straw was when post-delivery I asked him to check a hemorroid. He told me that it was 'fine', which I found out was clearly not the case when I visited a surgeon the following week.  "
4635,41176,1.0,"I saw Dr. Taylor for an ovarian cyst.  He assured me he could remove the cyst w/out removing my ovary.  When I asked him about it again bef. surgery, he said &quot;I spent an hour going over this with you.  I already told you the reports indicate we can remove the cyst w/out removing the ovary.&quot; I was on the operating table, and everyone else was ready to go, except him. The nurse said he was not answering pages.  One of the other drs. said he was sitting in the lounge talking (which did not reassure me as I was lying there waiting to be cut open). I woke up from surgery, was of course horribly groggy and out of it, and he told me he removed my ovary, and then promptly left. When I saw him in his office afterwards, he could not respect my choice not to go onto Lupron to induce early menopause (something other doctors have since told me would be a horrible idea given my situation).  He said, &quot;well, you only have at least 12 years of painful periods then. &quot;  I would never recommend him, ever! "
4636,41177,2.0,I wouldn't recommend going here.  Nice Dr. but the place smelled of dust which is disgusting.  Had to wait.  I was also told that WEA insurance would pay for STD testing and sure enough I got my bill and it wasn't covered.  Thank you to the insurance office staff for ensuring it would be covered when it wasn't 
4637,41177,2.0,Dr. Thompson is a fantastic all round Doctor.  Highly recommend! 
4638,41178,1.0,"Dr. Thomassen's surgical skills reflect the advanced training he received during his fellowship at Wills Eye Hospital in Philadelphia, PA. His knowledge and skills, especially in cataracts,cornea, external disease and his skill in LASIK are exceptional. I now see 20/15 without glasses and would recommend him to anyone. He treats every patient like he would treat his own family, and always takes the time to explain exactly what is going on and what the treatment plan will be. While I have been in the office, other doctors interrupted to seek his consultation on difficult cases. The staff were very helpful and caring.  "
4639,41179,0.0,"Dr. Toth was amazing. In clinic, she's funny and personable yet knowledgeable and confident. Prior to surgery, she was all business, but still very approachable. Upon consulting with her, she evaluated my issue and just &quot;knew&quot; the treatment plan. Her awesome nurse was able to schedule my procedure the next business day. At the hospital, everyone spoke highly of her. One of my nurses even said that, of all the surgeons available, his family used Dr. Toth with confidence. On the day of my procedure, she was slightly late only because another surgeon had requested her to be on stand-by in case their procedure went wrong. All of this says volumes to me! My surgery went quickly and without a hitch. My incision is much smaller than I expected; recovery has been pretty easy. She was prompt to my follow-up, even before her nurse had finished vitals. I would send closest friends and family to see Dr. Toth without hesitation. Should I ever need another procedure, I will go to her. "
4640,41179,0.0,"I found Dr. toth to be extremely helpful, knowledgeable and while she was late she took the time with me that was needed for me to understand my situation. She was kind, thorough, answered all of my questions in a way I could understand and most definitly did not promise me anything that was not deliverable.  Frankly I doubt very much that she would ever promise anything that was not an absolute. Because I was scared and could not &quot;hear&quot; everything, she went over and over it all with me and also followed up with me.  I felt that she bent over backwards in trying to help me manage my fear and lack of knowledge.  She has been rated best general surgeon in Madison for many years and I believe, given my experience that it is well deserved. "
4641,41179,0.0,DR.Toth promised things she could not deliver.She said if I removed the breast I would not have to have chemo.She did this before doing any testing.After my surgery I ended up having extensive cancer and had to have chemo and radiation therapy.If testing would have been done before hand the outcome would have been different.

4645,41180,0.0,"Dr Torres is an awesome Dr. She is so helpful, explains things so I can understand. Dr Torres cares about those who come to see her. She has a passion for her patients that comes threw. Never rushes me and is always listening to what I am saying. Even if I have a question as we are leaving the exame room she stops to take the time to answer that question. Patients can tell if the Dr really cares. Dr Torres Cares. If every Dr cared about the patient as much as she does the medical field would be so Blessed. Maybe I should say that we the people needing a Dr care would be  the blessed ones. I pray Dr Torres stay her in the Valley to grow her medical career. "
4646,41180,0.0,"Dr Torres is very helpful and very knowledgeable. She took the time to listen to my concerns, and recommended a course of treatment while explaining things very clearly and in a manner that I could understand.  "
4647,41181,1.0,"I hate the women in the office and I can't say he knows everything about everything but I WOULD JUMP OFF A CLIFF FOR THIS DOCTOR! I am deeply in love with him and will never go anywhere else. We have seen him since my eldest son is born which will be 19 years in January. He is so warm, has the best bedside manner and generally seems to care.  I would recommend him to anyone, he is a rare gem! "
4648,41181,1.0,He's a very caring and very knowledgeable GP. Everyone in my family has been seeing him for years. 
4649,41182,1.0,"I have been with Dr. Teclaw for almost 20 years now. I am always taken right on time, everybody is very polite, and most importantly, I have never come back with a problem for any treatment in that time.  "
4650,41182,1.0,"I first came to Dr. Teclaw in the early 90's. I've never had a more caring and thoughtful person in the dental business. Soon after I had children we all were under his care. Every time when I have had a situation where I needed attention due to tooth pain, mouth injury, or any other needs, he was always there for me or my family.  His attention to detail and zest for quality oral health has always amazed me.  He is a very dedicated professional person, and I will always be his patient.  I have in the past always tried to refer as many people to him as I could. Dr Teclaw, thanks for all you do for me. "
4651,41182,1.0,"The atmosphere is kid friendly yet professional.  The staff are personable, caring and informative.  I recall as a kid that visiting the Dentist was a fun adventure rather than a frightful experience. "
4652,41182,1.0,All the staff at Dr Teclaw office work to make the entire experience from scheduling to cleaning to major dental work a pleasant one.  Dr Teclaw is a great family dentist. 
4653,41182,1.0,"After being premedicated for a procedure to be done in Dr. Teclaw's office, he cancelled the appointment because he was running 20 min late and the &quot;office manager&quot; did not schedule enough time for the procedure. I had been so anxious about the appointment I had not slept for 2 days and he was aware of this. I told him I wanted my medical records and filled out a release. When I arrived at the office (which is located near a very congested bus stop) they were closed and all of my medical records were taped to the front door. I was mortified to know that people could have seen my name and personal information. "
4654,41183,1.0,did a lobectomy and cut the lobe in 3 peaces. that's not the normal way. one wedge for biopsy and the rest of the lobe if the wedge is cancerous. by doing the the path. did not do a correct path on all the sections of the lung and when i went for second opinion the oncologist &#63; him and the path. it was redone and another tumor was fond. this makes a big difference in staging and treatment.  
4655,41184,1.0,Dr. Thor's staff is very courteous and professional.  I've been there 3 times now and I have never had to wait more than 2 minutes.  Dr. Thor takes the time to personally explain everything he is doing and what you should expect.  
4656,41185,2.0,Fantastic Surgeon. Very skilled. 
4657,41186,0.0,Would NEVER recommend Dr. Trampe to anyone!! Heres why: for a year she let me suffer with my gynecological problems without doing anything! I called multiple times and even saw her in the office three times before going elsewhere. I work in womens health and asked if she could maybe schedule me a pelvic ultrasound to see if there was anything there that could be causing the abnormal bleeding. She told me i didnt know what i was talking about and switched my birth control instead. When after three monthes this hadnt helped a bit i scheduled an appointment to see Hilary Kufahl. She recommended the ultrasound and lo and behold yes there was an abnormality causing all my problems not birth control! She did surgery on me and i havent had a single problem since. Dr. Trampe spends as little time with you as she can and asks if you have any questions while she is walking out the door so even if you do you cant ask them.  Horrible doctor dont waste your time! 
4658,41186,0.0,"i love dr. trampe. she is quick and helpful. i like to see a woman, as i am one. she answered all &#63;s and i was on my way. she offered great advice and made my visit easy.  "
4659,41186,0.0,"Definitely wouldnt recommend this Dr. to anybody else. I only came to her for my physical because I wanted a woman and she took my insurance. She was nice I guess, but only spent about 10 to 15 mins in the room with me, seemed rushed and seemed to dismiss my questions and concerns like I was taking up too much of her time. I dont know that I really want to come back to see her, I love the staff at her location however so I am going to try and find a different doctor at the same location.  "
4660,41186,0.0,Complete physical lasted less than 10 minutes. She ordered blood drawn and never called me with results. . . .all this for $200.00.  I will never so to her again 
4661,41186,0.0,"Compassionate, articulate and knowledgeable. No hassle check-in, called within 4 minutes. Dr. Trampe took her time to answer any questions.  "
4662,41186,0.0,VERY BAD BEDSIDE MANNERS........  SEEMED RUSHED   THATS PROPABALY WHY ALWAYS HAS OPEN APPOINTMENTS  I WOULD NNNOOOTTT! SEE HER AGAIN 
4663,41187,2.0,.  
4664,41188,2.0, 
4665,41189,1.0,Excellent physician -- very efficient with his time utilization -- allows for optimum time with patients.  
4666,41189,1.0,"Good doctor who listened to me and talked over my issues. Sorry I had to leave him, but disagreements with Aurora forced me to. Too bad this clinic wasn't still Advanced Healthcare and not Aurora, because I'd still be with Dr. Tanty. "
4667,41190,1.0,"Dr. Tilkens is Great. He explained everything in plain english so that I could understand. Answered all my questions in detail and I never felt rushed. After the surgery, things went exactly as he said it would. I highly recommend him. He's the only podiatrist I would ever use.  "
4668,41191,2.0,"Very rude staff, Office canceled appointment and did not offer to reschedule. Long waits when on time for appointment's. Dr. Tan is very nice and a good doctor but staff needs work.  "
4669,41192,1.0,Dr. Tamez and the whole staff are always wonderful.  My kids and I love them!  He always takes the time to answer my questions and concerns.  Appointments are normally very timely.  
4670,41192,1.0,. I changed my entire family over to him after our first visit 
4671,41193,0.0,"Dr. Theyerl truly listens and addresses any concern that I express. I greatly appreciate the time that she gives in an office visit. I did in a past year have some difficulty with scheduling appointments, but that seems to have improved in the most recent 2 years. As a female, I can say that she is very well informed on women's health issues. Her recommendations have benefited my health through changing eating habits. "
4672,41193,0.0,"Dr. Theyerl is the best doctor I have ever had.  She listens to every comment and doesn't rush.  She is not about how fast she can type/dictate while &quot;listening&quot;.  She is not afraid to research something in front of you, consult other physicians or refer you for tests.  She is thorough, thoughtful and most importantly respectful.  She is an advocate for your needs and will go the extra mile for you.  Dr. Theyerl diagnosed a rare condition and saved my life; literally, I would have died less than 24 hours later had she not recognized what was going on with me and admitted me to ICU.  I am lucky to have her as my doctor.  "

4674,41193,0.0,"I appreciate all the time Dr. Theyerl takes with me when I come into see her each year.  She was very helpful in setting up the cares I needed after the visit. Dr. Theyerl takes the time to listen to the problems, respects your judgement and I feel I can approach her about anything.  "
4675,41193,0.0,"Awesome doctor, Takes the time necessary to help me.  "
4676,41193,0.0,"I scheduled a first time appointment 6 weeks in advance for my elderly mother with this doctor. I cannot comment on the services of the doctor as we never saw her. The office called 10 minutes before her 9AM appointment to inform us that we would be seeing a nurse practioner, not the doctor. We were already in the office, having arrived 20 minutes in advance as requested by office's new patient dictum. When I voiced objection to the switch, they quickly 180'd and said we would be seeing the doctor. Once inside the exam, the NP appeared and the doctor never did. We felt sandbagged. This is no way to treat a new patient. If you don't have time to see patients, then close your intake. "
4677,41193,0.0,"I contactet Dr. T when she first came to town, she seemed nice and said she'd treat my porphyria. The American Porphyria Foundation sent her information, and I wrote her to see if she would check me into the hospital-she never replied, I wrote her three times! Finally I had to have a hospital administrator intervene to get her to return my things.  Terrible, terrible experience and a complete waste of time, so rude,,,,,,, "
4678,41193,0.0,"After seeing 8 different health care providers, looking for an answer for my medical problems, I found Dr. K. She spent more time with me than many others combined. She listened to me, asked me great questions & ordered tests. She responds quickly & genuinely cares. My condition is rare & something she does not treat but referred me to a specialist. Even though she would not treat a patient for my condition she was still interested in any learning about it.  She is the most incredible, caring Dr I have ever seen "
4679,41194,0.0,I strongly disagree.  Sounds like you are the one with the problem and not her.  She is absolutely amazing and highly recommend her!!!!!  Her staff are the most caring welcoming people I have ever met.  They know you by name and treat you like family.  I wouldn't change clinics even if my insurance wouldn't allow me to go there!!! 
4680,41194,0.0,"I started seeing Tran about a year ago for normal gyno procedures and started using her as my primary doctor. There was my first mistake. She diagnosed me with depression and put me on an SSRI Lexapro. I found out the hard way that Dr. Tran SHOULD NOT prescribing SSRI drugs. I would never send anyone i cared about to her for anything other than GYNO appointments. Because of her lack of knowledge about the drugs she had prescribed me my husband and I spent the first year of our marriage plagued with, at that time, unknown side effects. I complained of severe headaches, sexual side effects, electrical shock sensations and intense dizziness, Dr. Tran never connected the dots as to the fact that lexapro was causing all the issues instead she put me on more drugs when all the signs were clearly pointing to the fact that Lexapro was not working for me.  I want all of you to be aware and do your research before you listen to her! She isn't a psychiatrist and don't trust her to act as one! "
4681,41195,0.0,"My daughter had a short hospitalization at the hospital, she left after one night. The staff was really friendly and helpful. "
4682,41196,1.0,"This doctor has given gifts to child patients an act that is suspicious, unprofessional and dangerous especially to children who are victims of parental rejection syndrome. He is part of the problem rather then part of the solution. One should tread lightly. Any father struggling with divorce should keep his kids clear of this 'doctor'. "
4683,41197,1.0,"I'm still in awwhh over seeing Glen Toth. Never in my lifetime have I looked a doctor straight in the eye and they tell me there going to find the cause of the illness and not throw a bag of sample medicine at me. This is just the beginning but...you know in that movie when the actress says:&quot;you had me at hello&quot; right before he he does the wedding proposal. Well....same here, doc had me when he said &quot;I'm going to find the cause&quot;.  "
4684,41197,1.0,". I have been going to see Dr Toth for years and was very surprised to find one negative review for him at all! I would fly to see him if I lived far away! Not only do I get calls returned within the same day( same cannot be said of my Cardiologist!) but I am always treated w/ respect and kindness, NOT too common in Dr's ( I am a nurse, so I have seen a LOT!) He gets down to the actual cause of the condition even if it takes awhile~I am wholeheartedly pleased and love his new office~  he gets a 10 out of 10 from me  More Dr's could learn from him! "
4685,41197,1.0,"I just had my first intital appointment with Dr. Toth and can honestly say that I have never had a doctor spend as much time as he did with me.  He asked a lot of questions and really listened.  I have a complex condition that will take some time to figure out and he was not arogant about admiting that.  I would recommend him to anyone that is frustrated with the conventional medical system and lack of attention and care.  Unfortunately, doctors such as he are rare and it takes quite awhile to get into see him, which speaks a lot of his capabilites as well.  I feel that if anyone is going to be able to help me figure out the cause of this, he will. "
4686,41197,1.0,"Dr. Glenn Toth is a very rare MD in that he: (1) takes time and has the compassion, intelligence, humility, and humor, to work with me and my long, complex list of conditions; (2) treats patients as individuals and considers multiple factors, i.e. person, symptoms, circumstances, and unique environments; and (3) remains open-minded, keeps abreast of research and practice in various healing modalities, and has a keen understanding of naturopathic research and practice.   As an intelligent and analytic person, I take responsibility for my own life and do exhaustive research before making my own decisions regarding meds and procedures.  Whereas most cookie-cutter MDs are annoyed by such a patient, Dr. Toth is willing and able to work WITH me in exploring solutions that work for me.  After too many specialists, I feel blessed to have found Dr. Glenn Toth; he is worth the out-of-pocket expense, the three-hour commute, and 2-3 month wait time. --G.M., MSSW, CISW "
4687,41197,1.0,I used to say I'd drive 1000 miles to see him...  Now I come close... I fly!  He's awesome with diagnosis and interest in his patients' total care.  He takes the time to really listen and work on each symptom to achieve optimal health for his patients. 
4688,41197,1.0,"Intensely knowledgeable, very good with my complicated situation - Chronic Fatigue/Immune Dysfunction. Diagnosed and treated heavy metal poisoning, something none of the other dozens of doctors I've seen figured out. Very helpful. "

4690,41197,1.0,"I love Dr. Toth! He is the most patient caring doctor I have ever met, and I have been to many. He spends alot of time with you and answers any questions asked. When you discuss issues with him he will be thinking about what you are saying and searching for answers as you speak. Getting an appointment can take weeks but he is worth the wait....Thank you Dr. Toth for being what all doctors should strive for. Keep up the good work and pleasent personality.  "
4691,41197,1.0,"dr toth is a gem.  i feel that he is very caring, kind, and knowledgable.  his goal is to find the root of the problem and turn it around.  he has helped me so much.  i now enjoy good health and am very happy.  his staff is so wonderful and very caring.  they have given me their whole hearted attention so that i felt that they truly were my friends.  this office is one in a million. "
4692,41197,1.0,"Been going to Dr. Toth for years, because he is the MOST knowledgeable Dr. I have ever met. He genuinely cares for me as a patient and works toward getting the BEST results / lifestyle for me with my health conditions...allergies, asthma, other. I recommend him to friends of mine all the time, because he never lets a person down. He personifies professionalism, honesty & morality. "
4693,41197,1.0,"dr toth very wonderful doc,after seeing many so call specailist and seeing my family doc. over 3 yrs peroid .dr toth was the only one that found real case to my high blood pressure.and his has called me back many times while at a meeting in other states.he also very informative.and take his time with you.not just 10.oo minutes and out door.i think god send me to me.and the office staff is great willing to answer question for you.also lab, billing nursing.i have work many in places.that were rude and none caring.they are very careing in office. sign debbie "
4694,41197,1.0,Dr. Toth is wonderful! He is compassionate and knowledgeable. He spends a lot of time with his patients. He has always returned my phone calls. One time I paged him at 7 a.m. and he called at 7:15 a.m. I've referred friends to him and they were greatly helped after getting nowhere with the so-called &quot;experts.&quot; 
4695,41197,1.0,Dr.Toth was very helpful. He was the first doctor to address the source not just symptoms. I had been on many prescriptions now on very few. He answered my questions and gave helpful advice.  
4696,41197,1.0,"I disagree with the other reviewer completely. I searched for over 2 years for a doctor who would listen, and Dr Toth is the first I've met who actually HELPED me and treated my symptoms and not just my 'lab results'. He was extremely knowledgeable, extrememly compassionate, and extrememely approachable. I've been everywhere - to the so-called 'experts' at the Froedtert/Medical College who pretty much blew me off - talk about feeling rushed! Dr. Toth is smart, kind, and completely without pretense. I'd choose him any day. "
4697,41198,1.0,"Dr. Thomas treated my husband, my son, and me.  He has the gift of being able to put together the correct combination of medications in order for the patient to have the best outcome. He saved our family.  After seeing Dr. Thomas, our lives completely changed for the better.  He always took as much time with us as we needed.  Many times he ran late, but I soon realized that he was helping someone who needed more time than was originally allotted.  I was one of those patients a few times after that.  The extra time helped me through some tough events in my life.  My family saw Dr. Thomas for over 13 years.  The only reason we stopped seeing him was because he relocated out of state. It was difficult to see him go. We will always be grateful for the care we received from Dr. Thomas.  We only wish he could have stayed here longer. "
4698,41198,1.0,I was a patient of Dr. Thomas for seven years.  There were many life events that occurred during this period and I don't think I would have made it through without him.  He was interested in what I had to say and I participated in my treatment.  The guidance he gave me was invaluable.

4702,41199,1.0,Dr. Tilleson is the greatest doctor I have every had the pleasure to visit. He purposely schedules time to &quot;just talk&quot; and truly wants to get to know you. He will take as much time as you want. He is very easy to talk too and will answer any questions you might have.  
4703,41199,1.0,"Only met with Dr. Tillison once to see if we wanted to switch doctors.  He was very friendly, had plenty of time, very punctual and staff was also helpful.  "

4708,41200,0.0,"I was assured via phone that Dr. King possessed a deep and thorough knowledge of fibromyalgia. This presumed assumption of her ability in this area prompted my decision to drive two hrs. out of town from my home, after many failed attempts locally to find relief. She was very rude to both myself and my family during the course of my visit, and could only deliver more of the same failed care that I received in the past. Also, the rooms were very dirty and in dire need of repair. I noticed the lack of basic medical equipment usually found not only in a doctors office, but specifically in a specialty clinic. Other than the intake person at the front desk, who was pleasant, the other staff were unfriendly.  "
4709,41201,2.0,Very professional and caring clinic.  You will like this clinic and Dr. Scheff. 
4710,41201,2.0,Great office and dentist!  I felt very comfortable and feel the dentist truly cares about my health and needs. 
4711,41202,1.0,My daughter had scoliosis surgery back in 2007. It was a scary time for my family except my daughter that had the surgery. Did not seem to faze her a bit. I would credit this to Dr. Tassone and his entire staff. Top notch in every aspect.. If you have this unfortunate situation arise in your family I would highly reccomend Dr. Tassone.World Class 
4712,41202,1.0,"I was his first patient at the milluake childrens hospital eight years ago, if it wasn't for him fixing my spine, I don't know where i WOULD BE TODAY.  hE SAVED MY LIFE!!!!!!!!!! "
4713,41202,1.0,he is an excillent docter. i had scoliosis and i had to get surgery. he did it perfect. he visited me every day in the hospital. now my back is perfectly straight. if i had to chose a docter i would diffently chose hime. after my experience i want to become a scoliosis docter as well. i thank hime so much for all he has done.  
4714,41202,1.0,"He seemed to rushed, and more in a hurry to see all his patients some days then most. never is on time.  so be prepared to wait. very knowledgeable though.  "
4715,41202,1.0,"Dr. Tassone has been our daughter's doctor since birth - she was born with clubfoot and Dr. Tassone handled the casting and a corrective surgery brilliantly.  Can't recommend him highly enough - explains things clearly, has the patience of Job, and as other commenters have mentioned, he helps you feel confident and hopeful.  This is what all doctors should be like.  "
4716,41202,1.0,Dr. Tassone is a remarkable doctor and person. He has amazing bedside manner with both his patient and parent(s).  Obviously a bright man and a top notch doctor we were lucky to find him!!! 
4717,41202,1.0,Dr. Tassone gave my daughter the best care. She had to have a salter osteotomy and spica cast. when in surgury he made sure that we were updated on her condition. It helped a lot when waiting and not being with my baby. I knew that she was in great hands. He was easy to reach at night when we were in the hospital. He was the first person to see her in the morning to release her to go home. I would highly recommend him to any one. 
4718,41202,1.0,"Regarding a scoliosis eval. visit when Dr. Tassone was at Scottish Rite in Dallas... Not only was Dr Tassone oobviously knowledgeable about his field, he was able to accurately put into nonmedical terms the things our child was facing. He was cordial and polite, not rushed even though he was quite scheduled that day, and he had an easy-going, disarming way with our little girl who was a bit scared. The best thing is that he was joyful and optimistic - that's contagious, it fosters hope, and when combined with his obvious expertise, makes for a very rare and very valuable man in medicine. My only regret (and it's a selfish one), is that Dr. Tassone moved out of the area, but those who have access to him in Wisconsin will be greatly served and greatly blessed. No question - his services are worth whatever it takes to procure them.  - Michael Russo "
4719,41202,1.0,"Dr. Tassone is excellent with childhood fractures. If he doesn't know the answer (which is rarely), he will direct you to others in the hospital who know, and will follow your case all the way through, even if it leaves orthopedics (like in the case of an infection). He is a very friendly doctor, and can relate with kids- a great doctor overall. "
4720,41203,1.0,Dr. Terlizzi is the best ob/gyn I have ever seen! He is very nice and never makes me feel rushed. He thoroughly answers all my questions and lets me know that he is always available if needed. Highly recommended.  
4721,41203,1.0,he is a wonderful doctor! he will spend as much time with you as you need and answer all of your questions.  i would not go anywhere else! 
4722,41203,1.0,I have been a patient of Dr. Terlizzi for 15+ years and have only good things to say about him and his staff.  He performed major surgery on my five years ago and I have had no complications.  He always listens to me during appointments and lets me know that he is available whenever I need him.  He is great and I highly recommend his professional services.  
4723,41203,1.0,"I absolutely love Dr. Terlizzi.  I turned 18 in 2008 and have been seeing him ever since.  He is both extremely knowledgeable in his field and takes the time to make sure I understand everything.  I disagree with the other commenter about feeling like a number--he has several patients and occasionally is running behind schedule or seems in a rush, but I always feel like he makes sure I get all of my questions answered and he takes the time to talk to me and see where I'm at in my life.  He is personable as well as professional, and tells me after every appointment he is always available by telephone or e-mail should I need to speak with him.  When the time comes for me to start a family, I will definitely continue to see him. "
4724,41203,1.0,"I think Dr. Terlizzi is a wonderful doctor. He spends a lot of time with me and is extremely patient. I am on my 3rd pregnancy after 2 miscarriages and he has been infinitely patient, even offering to me that I could come in everyday to hear the beartbeat if it would make me feel beter. The nurses are wonderful and he truly seems to care about what I'm going through.  "
4725,41203,1.0,The man is the perfect ob/gyn. At least the best one I have seen. He spent nearly 20 min in his office (after the room exam) explaining my condition to me. The secretaries are overwhelmed (or at least when I was there) there was a lot of problems and long waits at the front desk. 
4726,41203,1.0,"This doctor is very knowledgable, but he treats you like anumber and spends very little time with you. IT is like he has his hand on the doorknob the whole time you are talking. He missed several signs of problems I was having dutring my second pregnancy, and one and a half years later, I am dealing with severe physical and emotional trauma.  He is a very nice person, but he does not try to get to know you as a person and as a unique patient with unique problems.  "
4727,41204,0.0,"Dr. Thousand has been extremely helpful and compassionate in helping me cope with my infertility issues.

I would recommend her to anyone who needs someone who actually listens! "
4728,41205,1.0,Dr. Tick believes in Homeopathic remedies. That alone should be enough for anyone looking for a new doctor to avoid him. Save your time and money and seek medical help elsewhere. 
4729,41205,1.0,"He is an excellent physician. Extremely knowledgeable, and he cares about his patients. He spends the time that is needed with you. I would highly recommend him. Our family has been seeing him for over 11 years now.  The best of the best! "
4730,41205,1.0,My whole family is very pleased. 
4731,41206,1.0,"Terrible doctor.  He messed up my feet so bad.  I had surgery to prevent bunions in the future, and twenty years later went to a board certified podiatrist who said he's never seen a doctor mess up someone's feet so badly.  He also operated on a friend's wrong knee.  Why this man is still in practice makes no sense to me. "
4732,41207,0.0,"She is so great with the kids.  She is professional yet fun, so the kids actually enjoy going to the doctor.  She was my children's doc until we had to move last year.   WE MISS HER! "

4738,41209,1.0,"Dr Tobin Is a great physician. He takes the time to explain to his patient what is going on. He is very concerned about each of his patients. Excellent bedside manners. He's always running a bit behind; however, you dont feel as though your are on an assembly line when you go to see him. Thanks Dr Tobin, you are the BEST!!! "
4739,41210,0.0,My daughter has been a patient of Dr. Tahir's since she was born in 2010. Called this morning because she was running a fever of 101.0 and said that both of her ears hurt her. The office got us in at 11 am. We arrived and waited 25 mins for the dr to come in and when he did he refused care to my daughter because &quot;your coats smell like cigarettes&quot; is what he told us. He REFUSED service for a sick child because her parent's coats smelled (not her because we do not smoke around her... we do know what damage 2nd hand smoke causes and will not do that to her). We then had to take her to the ER seeing as how she needed care ASAP. The staff at the ER was shocked beyond all belief at what he did to our child. She was diagnosed with a bilateral ear infection.  
4740,41211,2.0,Great doctor!

4743,41214,1.0,"Dr Taxman is outstanding in everyway.  My ONLY 'complaint' would be he is not always easy to get into BUT, when you are that great a doc and there are so many clammoring to get in to see you, what else would you expect.  He bends over backwards to address emergencies.  His care and concern is GENUINE and real, not contrived or artifical like I have experienced at other offices.  He is a gifted physcian and would encourage anyone in need of his services to be patient in getting an appointmenet, I promise it is worth it. "
4744,41215,1.0,Dr. Thurlow cut the nerves in the side of my face as a way to treat migraines and as a result he paralized my face.  
4745,41215,1.0,"This dr perferated my intestine during a sigmoid resection. Refused to see me or treat me for 10 days even though I had a fever, extreme swelling, and diagnosis of sepsis. He then damaged the nerves to my spine during the second operation after he returned from his hunting trip. He also ordered xrays with iodine knowing full well I was allergic to iodine. It is a miracle that I am alive and it took two more surgeries at UW to put me back together. He was always arrogant and never talked to me about the extent of my injuries. "

4750,41218,2.0,Very kind and caring. Good with patients. Easy to talk to. Very knowledgeable regarding ECT.  
4751,41219,1.0,"I only saw him twice because of limitations on my insurance, but he was excellent. Insightful and to the point and yet caring and respectful. The one sticking point was that he assumed I was straight, so I didn't go back. "
4752,41220,1.0,He is the best He saved my sister's life She had a tumor on her pituitary and her was able to remove it without damaging her sense of smell or sight. 
4753,41220,1.0,"I have been to numerous neurosurgeons in 42 years. Kamal Thapar stands out as one of the best, most caring NS's that has treated me. He's without question, one of the most helpful, and brilliant people I've seen. I would gladly recommend him to any person or family seeking a brilliant neurosurgeon. Don't overlook this man.  "
4754,41220,1.0,"Years ago he treated my mom in Toronto, when all specialists had given up. He is a very brilliant doctor and a wonderful human being. He was not afraid of taking a case that was rejected by all the specialists. He had the patience to listen and explain through MRI's, all the details. "
4755,41220,1.0,Dr. Thapar and Jolene are the best medical experts that I have seen. I just not explain everything that I feel about these people and their staff. Since my surgery I have ran into people that had Dr. Thapar and staff for surgery and everyone says the same things. Not one negative comment about anyone of them. He performed my surgery and was very upfront and honest about what he was going to do and thats exactly what was done. Very honest about prognosis also. I have been recommending Dr. Thapar and staff to many people if they are in need of a local neurosurgeon. 
4756,41220,1.0,"What can I say to describe Dr. Thapar besides...brilliant, caring, thoughtful, amazing, thorough, sincere...If I had to, I would do it all again if I knew he would be my surgeon, no hesitations! This man is remarkable, not just as a surgeon, but as a human being! He changed my life and everyday I am thankful for him! "
4757,41220,1.0,"This man is incredible - kind and brilliant, but not afraid to admit if he doesn't know something. He took care of my Mom and was probably the best listener and most compassionate clinician that she's ever seen over many years. Everyone that I know who has had surgery with him has amazing respect and love for him.  His credentials are amazing and he's even a real human being! You won't often see all this in a neurosurgeon :) "
4758,41221,0.0,"I have been seeing Dr. Temp for a few years now. I could not ask for a more caring, intelligent, thourough doctor. I have seen many OB GYN's in the area over the last 10 years...and none of them compare to the level of care I receive when I see Dr. Temp. "
4759,41221,0.0,"Dr Temp was my doctor during my pregnancy.  I thought her and her nurse Jen were very nice and treated my well. Dr. Temp is more quiet, but always answered the questions that I had and took very good care of me.

She never makes me feel stupid with any questions I have and also I was very sick for almost 20 weeks in my pregnancy and also had gallbladder problems. She came to see me in the hospital concerned for me and explained everything thoroughly! I would recommend her to anyone who is pregnant. Also I have had 4 friends go to her and they liked her as well. She is nice, caring and knowledgeable! "
4761,41221,0.0,"Very bad doctor. I had questions about my pregnancy and she treated my like I was stupid, when in fact they were valid, informed questions. She seems like a miserable person. I would not recommend her to anyone. "
4762,41221,0.0,"She was rude and condesending to me and to my husband before my surgery. She spoke over my head and was irritated when I asked to explain the medical jargon she was using. After surgery, she talked down to my husband and spent only 5 seconds with him and didn't give him any helpful information about what happened in surgery, and told him I would find out my options at my post-op. At my post-op she said I didn't have any options to fix the problem. Her bedside manner is horrific and I cried after talking with her. I can't believe she can practice medicine the way she does. I will never go back. I wish I would have seen this website before seeing her.  "
4763,41221,0.0,"Dr. Temp is a terrible doctor! She does not listen to what you have to say. She ignores complaints about pain and makes you feel as though are a baby and a complainer. However, my pain turned out to be a serious urinary tract infection that could have led to premature labor. She made me feel selfish. Everytime I told her about my pain, she would say that it was normal with every pregnancy. The only way I could see someone liking her is if they have a perfect pregnancy with no problems. Both Dr. Temp and her nurse seem annoyed if you have any questions or complaints. Find a different doctor! "
4764,41221,0.0,"Dr Temp is a horrible doctor.  She misdiagnosed me and put me through unnecessary surgery not once but twice.  Because of her negligence I eventually had to have an emergency hysterectomy.  She treated me like I was an addict when I told her the pain medicine she gave me didnt work.  I had severe bleeding, cramping and also a ruptured disc in my back that she ignored.  She is rude, impatient and condescending.  Her staff, especially her main nurse Jen, are horrible.  Anyone who values their health should stay far away from Dr Temp and her partners at Women's Specialty.  "
4765,41222,0.0,DR Thai was both rude and uncaring when I saw her. She yelled at me to stop talking when asked me to explain my symptoms. She was very condescending and acted annoyed when I asked her questions about the issues I was having. She left me waiting for about 30 min while helping other patients and not explaining why I had to wait. I had to get another nurse flagged down to go find her to come back. She is by far the rudest Dr. I have ever had. I would not see her again if my life depended on it. Had the same experience when she saw my son. She has zero bedside manner with people of any age. My son was just an infant when we saw her and she was cold to us both then as well.  
4766,41223,1.0,"The doctor is ok the receptionist is a B7tch.  My wife has been seeing this doctor now for over 3 years, she went in on a scheduled appointment day and was told she wouldn't be seen that day and should not have come in.  WHAT, really, I was there with her that day and I simply asked why.  Olivia (receptionists name) told me to stop being belligerent or should would call the cops.  I only asked why she was told to come in then told to leave when we got there.  Dumb founded, but not blaming the doc on this one.  Maybe she had an off day, dont know.  Anyway, the doctor is basically a pill peddler and the patients are there for one thing.  It is in the core of Milwaukee, in a poor neighborhood (as are most of the pain clinics in the Milwaukee area). While leaving the clinic expect to be approached by every crack head in the perimeter. But because of my wife's medical condition she does just require pain medicine and this doc is easy to get along with.  "
4767,41223,1.0,Very knowledgeable and caring. He answers all of my questions perfectly.  Couldn't ask for more.  
4768,41223,1.0,. he need to do more exams and less pain medicine 
4769,41223,1.0,"Overall Dr. Tamayo is one of the best doctors Ive seen. He has a great style and even though he sees a great number of patients, one after another, he does take the time to listen to you and treat you like a human being. Many doctors that handle pain are not as kind as Primo is. I give him an 8 out of 10 overall rating. (I never give a 10 and RARELY a 9, so this is very good) "
4770,41224,0.0,She insisted I was depressed because that's what the file said.  The depression entry was made 20 years ago shortly after my son died.  
4771,41224,0.0,"Don't even bother going to her.  She isn't very helpful and seems to think all problems are related to Fibromyalgia, but won't give you that diagnosis.  I saw her about 3 times and left her office with no guidance or help on what to do next.  I really love her nurse though....she actually helped me way more than the doctor did!  Honestly, I wish the nurse was the doctor instead! "
4772,41225,1.0,"Unlike others, I went to doctor Tann for Chronic back pain that wasn't resolved for years. He was the only doctor to filly explore the issue and give meaningful advice and proper medication. He is a tough doctor, as he won't just medicate, and will do alternate treatments, so I can see how some people are turned off. However, I was open to other treatments and felt he did great. "
4773,41225,1.0,He also didn't want another MRI. Said my pain was a mental issue and wanted me to do accupuncture as to which he could perform but the cost was expensive. He also said I need to take a seditive every night for the rest of my life.  Made me feel like pondskum and I wasn't fully functioning person. 
4774,41225,1.0,"This says his specialty is Phychiatry.  I was sent to him as a Pain Specialist for pain and numbness.  I wasted 3 months with him and finally got a referral to someone that would do something.  Dr. Tan would not do an MRI because he could &quot;picture&quot; what my film would look like.  Well, Dr. Tan, did that &quot;picture&quot; of my MRI include 3 bulged discs&#63;  One of which is bulged through and resting on the nerve in my back&#63;  Currently receiving Epidural Steroid injections from someone who made it a point to find the cause.  "
4775,41225,1.0,I always felt unwelcome &amp; like I was being interrigated. His nurse &quot;Corky&quot; is the most uncurtious &amp; unprofessional nurse I have ever encountered. She was always condescending &amp; rude. She verbaly said private details about my care in front of other patients. He has limited english abilitys.

4779,41228,0.0,My last annual was scheduled with Marcia.  I was nervous about seeing a new doctor due to insurance switch.  Was I ever glad... from the moment Marcia walked into the room she made me feel very comfortable.  She didn't rush at all through the appointment.  I felt totally open to tell her anything.  I would recommend her to anyone.  I will no longer look at my annuals as a negative thing.  
4780,41228,0.0,"Marcia delieverd my first child. It was an awesome experience. Marcia was there shortly after I went into the hospital and stayed after the delivery to make sure my baby was latching on correctly, even though it was her day off. She never rushed appointments. Asked questions to get to know our family and shared about hers. I wanted no medication and she helped me with strategies to achieve that goal.  Marcia really listened to what I wanted for my birth and gave excellent advice. It was great to have the option of having a midwife in a hospital setting. Marcia's partner at the hospital was also very good - Marta is her name. I had Marta for a handfull of appointments. We are so sad that our insurance has changed and she will not be able to deliver our second child. "
4781,41228,0.0,She delivered my first child. She really took time during the whole delivery to be there with us and explain things. And after the baby had arrived she checked in often to see how we were all adjusting. 
4782,41228,0.0,"Great midwife!  I highly recommend the St. Mary's midwives, they take so much time not only to get to know you medically but to get to know you personally as well. I'm very glad I switched from an ob/gyn to midwifery care. "
4783,41229,0.0,"Like the previous poster I was having a hard time finding a doctor who genuinely seemed like they cared and weren't just trying to rush me out the door. The two visits I have had so far with Dr. Thomason have shown her to be a great care provider. All of my concerns were addressed, there was prompt reply with emailed questions,  and it was all done in a caring manner. Definitely would recommend to friends and family! "
4784,41229,0.0,Dr. Thomason is the most caring doctor I have ever come across. It took me several visits over the years with several doctors before I found her and now she is my primary care provider. She makes you feel comfortable and really listens and doesn't rush you out the door. She genuinely cares about your comfort. I am so glad I found her.

She always tells you what she is about to do next during your exam, which to me is very comforting. I was very impressed the first time I saw her, as she was taking over for another doctor who was no longer at the office I go to and  she had taken the time to read my file before seeing me. I did not have to go over my medical history for her. I recommended her to my sister and she likes her too.  "

4802,41238,0.0,Dr ubell is and outstanding pediatrician who really understands kids and the needs of new parents. We absolutely love her and so do my kids. If I call her with a question she always responds within an hour. We have twin daughers with special needs and she always takes the time to answer my questions. I never feel rushed. She is also so supportive of new parents. 
4803,41239,1.0,Dr. Udlis is the best doctor ever.  He diagnosed my cancer when no one else did.  He saved my life.

4805,41241,2.0,"Rough handling of me, did not give me options of necessary procedure, made me wait, in tears, at pharmacy for pain medication. Needs to retire. I do not recommend this dentist. "
4806,41241,2.0, 
4807,41241,2.0,"Got me in for emergency visit quickly - and referred me to an oral surgeon fast.  Seems competent and friendly - but a little low on the empathy scale.

4808,41242,0.0,weight program here is the best-the nurse practitioner is the person you see. 
4809,41242,0.0,Doctor is on medical leave but still prescibes drugs and patient diet plans without seeing patients. Scary!!!!! 
4810,41242,0.0,This is the first time in many years I found a doctor who actually listened to me. I cried. I was always unable to lose more than a few lbs. This doctor gave me the way to lose weight by treating me for pre diabetic condition-really ahead of the pack. The weight is still off and I do feel great. I have sent other patients and they are happy too. 
4811,41242,0.0,"Staff could not fit me in for an appointment in order to refill RX's  and physician refused to fill RX's  until could be seen in office leaving me w/o my RX's for a whole month and some VERY painful and unpleasant (dizziness, shakiness, petite mall seizures daily, and trouble concentrating) side effects. What ever happened to &quot;Do No Harm&quot; Doc&#63; "
4812,41242,0.0,"Dr, Uebelacker prescribes drugs that should only be taken for a short duration on a long-term basis and seemed unaware that one drug in particular should not be taken on a long-term basis. The doctor refused to answer questions or present facts to support her decisions to put patient on medications for a condition that diet and exercise could have controlled.  The doctor said she has &quot;hundred's lined up to get on her drug combination.&quot; She also refused to re-assess the patient when requested and then terminated care of the patient after a family meeting in which she charged $100 for 15 minutes of her time. I would not recommend this doctor to anyone. "
4813,41243,1.0,Very friendly staff. Awsome Dr. When i take my daughter in to see him I love how he tells stories of his children in comparison to what my daughter is going through at the time. Most of my inlaws see him as well and I have never heard anything but great from them.  
4814,41243,1.0,Terrific doctor great with seniors very friendly and funny can help relieve tension about illness.   My father never had a better doctor

4817,41244,1.0,Awesome doctor. i have been going to this chiropractor since I was 4 years old and he has always been a very compassionate and caring doctor. He utilizes many new techniques to assist in healing and allignment. 
4818,41244,1.0,Excellent doctor. I have been going to him for about 25 years--and I only need to see him about 2x a year. He has not made any money on me as a patient. He is a genuinely concerned doctor. 
4819,41245,1.0,"Pre surgery visit was 10 min. I asked a couple questions, he asked if I had any more. Told me a few things I had read in the literature in the exam room while waiting for him. Offered no other info. Charged me and my insurance $300. Fully a waste of my time and money. During surgery: operating room was uncomfortably cold. He was distant and alloof. Perhaps he sows a good knot but otherwise seemed rough and a bit ham-handed considering the parts he was working with. There was a complication during surgery he did not discuss with me during or after surgery. After the surgery, in recovery, he wouldn't come within 20 feet of me. Spoke AT me from across the room. I felt totally dismissed. 6 months after surgery complications set in. Pain, swelling, sexual dysfunction. Usow examined me. He implied that the dysfunction was psychological, told me to take Advil for the pain. Povided no further insight or suggestions or game plan for discovery of cause of pain and swelling. Symptomatic approach "
4820,41246,1.0,"Dr. Utrie is arogant, rude and condescending. His office staff makes a new patient jump through hoops to see him (I was made to call my insurance company to see if Dr. Utrie was going to get paid). He did not help, barely did an exam, he didn't diagnose me, didn't offer help, and didn't want me to come back, though I was referred by my primary care doctor. He likes to pick and choose patients and I didn't fit his criteria, which apparently has to do with how much money he will make off of you. Not a good doctor. I hope no one else has to experience the humiliation he put me through. I'm appalled that a doctor would act so badly.  "
4821,41246,1.0,"When I told Dr. Utrie that I did not know how much to stretch since I have pain before I begin my stretching he responded with saying &quot;How should I know&quot;. The final time I saw Dr. Utrie he told me I was wasting his time and he didn't want to work with patients who have Fibromyalgia. Also, on a final note, he did not not discover that I have arthritis in my neck and back.  "
4822,41246,1.0,First Dr who truely understood my condition and knew how to deal with it.  Consistent measurements over several years now give me a good baseline to monitor disease progression and severity.  
4823,41246,1.0,Decided he was not going to help me before I even walked in his office.  Incomplete exam.  No labwork done.  Not a complete exam.  Wasted my time. 
4824,41246,1.0,Great Doc...  I have already recommended him to several people as I was recommended to him myself 
4825,41246,1.0,"Dr Utrie is very caring and empathetic- he fought with my insurance company to get me on a medication he thought I needed which took 3 months- his ofc staff Amanda RN is wonderful, caring, and educated.  The med he suggested is working miracles.  I would recommend him to anyone. "

Would recommend Dr Vijay to anyone for themselves, or anyone who loves and cares about an elderly parent, spouse, relative or friend and desires an excellent physician. "
4832,41251,1.0,"Dr. Verbsky's &quot;rules&quot; on who he deigns to treat are wrong and uncaring. I had to go elsewhere to get the help I so desperately needed, but by then my health had taken a serious and possibly irreversible downturn. He needs to seriously think about why he became a doctor.  I so regret I ever heard of him.  "
4833,41251,1.0,"Dr. Verbsky is a smart, caring, and resourceful doctor. He will do anything in his power to help, and is the kind of guy that &quot;puts you at ease&quot;. Overall, a doctor that does his job above the call of duty! "

4839,41253,0.0,"Dr. Van Fossen is BY FAR the BEST physician around!  She is the SWEETEST most KNOWLEDGABLE person.  She takes extra time to make sure that her patients are well taken care of.  She gets my highest regards!  This is my 2nd pregnancy with her and she still is amazing... she made sure that I, being high risk, was under control and as healthy as I could be for my pregnancies.  I never thought that I would've had as healthy a pregnancies as I did with my condition, but Dr. Van Fossen changed that.  She put a smile on my whole families face including mine!!!  Thank you Dr.  Van Fossen for being there and being AWESOME! "
4840,41253,0.0,If you are looking for a great OBGYN...then you've found the best around!  I've recommended Dr. Van Fossen to any friends that are looking for new OB's.

She truly is the best!! 
4841,41253,0.0,"Intelligent and personable doctor.  Was sincerely interested and concerned about me and my baby.  Took extra time during appointments and even made a few phone calls to me to ensure things were going well.  I think because she gets excited for each patient and tries to take special time with each that she gets behind on appointments. She would take the time you needed, but would be ansy to get to the next patient.  Hands-down an excellent doctor and surgeon.  "
4842,41253,0.0,"Very personal and helpful doctor.  Great bedside manner as well as competent surgeon.  Sometimes there is a little bit of a wait, but, I think that is due to her taking extra time with her patients.  "

4847,41255,1.0,"This doctor mismanaged my healthcare for several years. He was not interested in what was happening to me. He stated that he did not want to &quot;hear&quot; about it. He made medication and diagnostic errors. Protect your elderly relatives and friends, do NOT utilize this person! I learned this lesson too late. "
4848,41256,1.0,"Dr Vega did my surgery &lt;masectomy&gt; for breast cancer. He was very informative, detailed and compassionate with information. He is a really great doctor and was very kind and professional "

4851,41257,1.0,I had bunion surgery on 3/15/12 by Dr VanBeek &amp; I would highly recommend him to anyone who has been putting this surgery off. He took his time with me &amp; listened to all of my concerns. It was not nearly as bad as I had anticipated.I asked alot of questions before &amp; after surgery and he answered all of them. Just ensure you follow his directions exactly.  Sherry 
4852,41257,1.0,He is soo nice! I felt very comfortable talking to him and he fixed my broken toe.  
4853,41258,1.0,"I found Dr. Vravick to be lacking in knowledge of insurance practices and unwilling to discuss things. When I tried to talk to him he just picked up a couple of my phrases and threw them back at me, saying, &quot;All I'm hearing is (this phrase) and (that phrase). I would agree that he wasn't hearing. He was insistent on prescribing to me in a manner that differed from my decades-long prescription because he said he would be &quot;dishonest&quot; if he prescribed the same way (brand name rather than generic). It wasn't a &quot;medical necessity.&quot; He wouldn't listen when I tried to tell him that my insurance company would cover it, had been covering it, we just paid a higher deductible. He doesn't listen. I informed him that I would not be coming to him again, so he prescribed for just a short-term, this medication I've been taking since 1995, because I &quot;wouldn't let him examine me.&quot; A very controlling sort of person, very headstrong, not who I want for a doctor. I'm looking elsewhere. I don't need this. "
4854,41258,1.0,Dr. Vravick took all the time I needed to explain my situation and all my options.  He wanted to be sure I was comfortable with the course of treatment.  The two whiners were probably drug seekers.  
4855,41258,1.0,Doctor Vravick has been my primary physician for 15 years and have been very satisified with his professionlaism. I have always felt at ease with him and have had all my questions answered to my satisfaction.  
4856,41258,1.0,"Gave false information about testing available.  Said there was none for a serious family history of annuerysms and there is.  I had to go to another doctor to learn this.  Would never recommend this guy.  Isn't knowledgable, timely, or worth your time or money. "
4857,41258,1.0,"Dr. Vravick did not take the time to listen to me. I came to him with a serious problem and asked him to help me through it and he denied I had a problem, did not order additional tests and would not let me ask questions or make additional comments. I trusted him to help me with my condition and truly listen to me. I did not feel comfortable in his presence at all. I felt he did not take me seriously, I felt I was a waste of his time. I left his office in the middle of the conversation because he would not believe me, help me or answer any questions or address any concerns I had. I was extremely disappointed at his &quot;bedside manner&quot; and do not recommend him to anyone I care about. I have not been back to any doctor since that appointment. He has turned me off to doctors in general. I will take my search for a doctor much more seriously now and will be extra careful who I choose and how they act. Dr. Vravick is very judgemental. "
4858,41259,1.0,I travel all the way from Washington state just to see this guy ;) 
4859,41259,1.0,He rocks my socks off :) 
4860,41260,2.0,"staff- very helpful Punctuality- is excellent  Helpfulness-dr.  very approachable,nice  knowledge- is workable "
4861,41261,0.0,"Dr Vaughn is an absolutely wonderful physician! She is gentle, kind, and very knowledgeable! "
4862,41262,1.0,My experience with Dr. Vukich and importantly my outcome was exceptional. I had LASIK in both eyes 12 months ago and I just completed my one year follow up. Before I decided on Dr. Vukich to do my surgery I researched every surgeon within 100 miles of my home and his name kept coming up as the best. Now I see 20/15 and am so glad that I took the time to find the right surgeon. 
4863,41262,1.0,Doctor approved me for the refrective surgery before analyzing my eye exam results. I took out flex benefit money for full amount but I was denied minutes before my sergery. Nobody from the doctor's office even called me to let me know that he will not perform a surgery for me because of the higher risk factors. Is he really a knowlegable doctor&#63;&#63;&#63;&#63;&#63; 
4864,41262,1.0,"I have post-LASIK ectasia, especially in my left eye.  I did not have healthy eyes when I had the procedure, and I doubt I should have had it done (weak muscle, retinal drainage). This doctor rates himself in the top 5% in the country.  I have read that post-LASIK ectasia occurs in about 1 in 2500.  I see (with me right eye, not left), that I am not the only person suffering from a serious eye condition after being treated by this doctor who bothered to make a note about it here and it make me wonder about the quality of the service. "
4865,41262,1.0,"Dr. Vukich performed Lasik on my eyes in May 1999. My eyes are now a &quot;mess.&quot; My surgery could have been a success had Dr. Vukich followed the guideline that for every decade you are in hard contacts/gas permeable, you are in glasses for 1 month.  I wore hard contacts for 17 years and was out of contacts for 3.5 weeks, so my refraction was accurate the day before surgery, and therefore I was 20/20 the day after.  However, weeks after Lasik, my eyes were still returning to their natural shape, so my vision deteriorated.  I regret daily having had Dr. Vukich work on my eyes. He didn't appear remorseful or even disappointed for me, and never offered an explanation.  I have learned this from seeking help and solutions (for which there are none) from other eye doctors. I have biannual prescription changes, dry eyes, halos, double vision and can't be fitted to 20/20 in glasses.  I don't care about the money, I just wish I'd never trusted my eyes to Dr. Vukich. "
4866,41263,0.0,"Very happy with most of our contacts with Dr. Vloka and her staff.  She knows her stuff, answers questions thoroughly and her staff helped us through the process wonderfully.  I did take a point off helpfulness because follow up to the surgery was a bit weak.  I would have no qualms recommending her to others.  "
4867,41263,0.0,If you are timid and sensitive this Dr. may scare you. I love her and her staff.  
4868,41263,0.0,"Rude, brusque, demanding.  Gave us no time for questions.  Her staff told us our sick dad was &quot;not the only patient in the hospital&quot;.  We &quot;fired&quot; her and wrote a letter to chief of medicine.  Couldn't have been worse. "
4869,41264,2.0,One of the most knowledgeable docs I have had 
4870,41265,1.0,"Rude, incompetent staff. Dr is self important.  Received no help for symptoms which brought me to him. Couldn't get test results "
4871,41266,0.0,"I have nothing but compliments for Dr. Vedder and her staff.  The office staff was very helpful and recommended bringing records to the appointment that resulted in the need for fewer tests ordered and reduced my costs.  Dr. Vedder examined me, diagnosed my problem, provided treatment, and within a short period of time my symptoms are gone.  I am confident in Dr. Vedder and plan to continue to see Dr. Vedder for myself and my family. "
4872,41266,0.0,"Received a botched toncillectomy from her. She knicked my artey and poorly fixed it. only to realize this a week later a week later when i woke up gushing bloody from a poor fix up job. She was out of town so i went to Dr. Swerdlin. He fixed it up and i will never wish her terrible hack jobs on anyone else. Coming to within minutes of bleeding out is something that was tramatizing. I never received any letters of regret or sympathy, just a bill for a terrible surgery. She should not be able to practice medicine.  "
4873,41266,0.0,This doctor gave me an expensive hearing test for a blocked sinus and then suggested I take some over the counter sinus medication.  I didn't need the hearing test and could go get otc meds on my own without the hefty bill.  
4874,41267,1.0,"This is one of the worst experience I ever had. I hurt my shoulder and there was an internal bleeding in the shoulder ligament. I was charged for x-ray & MRI (&gt;$2000) and in the end the diagnosis he gave me is, the wound would heal over the time and I wasn't given even a single medication.I dont need a so called specialist doctor to tell me that the wound would heal over the time. And he asked me to use Tylenol Pain reliever for 1 month to get rid of the pain. 6 months after I visited this doctor I am still in pain and I cant lift weights at gym. I probably have to go to another specialist I guess. This is so frustating and I suggest everyone in Sheboygan to reconsider before taking appointment with this man.  "
4875,41268,1.0,"Outstanding surgeon, perfect bedside manner, exceptional knowledge of his profession. Extremely caring individual. "
4876,41269,2.0,"Very Friendly staff, all spent time listening and caring about my situation "
4877,41270,1.0,"Dr. Vandehaar replaced my previous dentist, who recently retired. I had thought about switching, but was so impressed by this bright young man, that I have no intention of going elsewhere! Very nice, warm, and friendly -- unlike most of my previous dentists -- and very meticulous; his work was excellent. He took time to actually explain things to me and I no longer dread future appointments. Highly recommend this dentist.  "

4879,41271,1.0,"Dr. Vavra has the worst bedside manner of any doctor I have ever seen. I was is MAJOR PAIN two days after surgery and after complaining about it to him over the phone two times, he still didn't see me until my one-week post-op. Turned out it was INFECTED! I would NOT recommend this surgeon ever.  "
4880,41271,1.0,Dr. Vavra was the most honest physician I have ever met.  He did not push surgery when other doctors said that was my only option.  He tried shockwave on my tendon and I am pain free for the past 6 months.  
4881,41272,1.0,he doesnt do a good check on my son. i bring up the same problem every time im there and he ignores it. he was the doctor for my son at the hospital at birth and still wont tell me his blood type.  I am switching doctors and my son is only 2 months old!

4887,41278,1.0,"Dr. Valyo is a wonderful doctor and has seen me through a lot of rough times.  He is usually running behind, but that is because he really takes time with his patients and never makes you feel rushed.  I always try to make my appointments with him because I know he cares. "
4888,41278,1.0,Best doctor in the world!  Highly highly recommend him! 
4889,41278,1.0,Dr Valyo is the best doctor in the world. He could never be replaced. He cares about his patients. Even if you don't see him for a year he will remember what you talked about and ask you how your child did in that spelling B or if they have gotten there black belts yet and etc. We love him and hope to have him forever. 
4890,41278,1.0,Dean Care is not listed.Dr Valyo has been my Doctor for 8 years and could not be better at caring for his patients.  He asks questions and listens to the patients answers.  He is wonderful! 
4891,41278,1.0,Doctor Valyo is an excellent family doctor. He sincerely cares about your well being and takes the time to answer questions. I never feel rushed or uncomfortable. Great with kids & adults alike. 
4892,41278,1.0,Dr. Valyo takes the time to listen to his patients. Even though his office is busy I never feel that my appointments are rushed. He never discounts my concerns or makes me feel like I've asked a &quot;stupid&quot; question. I look forward to my appointments with him and go out of my way to see Dr. Valyo specifically. He is also great with kids! Highly recommended!! 
4893,41279,1.0,"Amazing!  Going to the wrong address getting the right help.  I was looking for another place for medical attention elsewhere, in a lot of pain, in tears with a back brace on suffering...This is how I landed at Chiropractic Company meeting Dr. Van Scoyk, oh how convenient closer to my home from where I was going.  I had to cancel where I was going after finding out they took my insurance and took me the NEXT DAY, praise God.  I have never experienced such a thorough examination and xrays with complete understanding of my body.  Educating me so I could understand what was going on with me crying through the whole experience grateful for the help I was about to receive, with it written in black and white for me to see for myself.  No pills No pain.  I walk better.  I feel better.  I work better.  More confident and I continue my adjustments faithfully and thankful for the help I am receiving. "
4894,41279,1.0,Dr. Van Scoyk has been extremely helpful with my back and migraine issues. He is very accessible and willing to get me in quickly when a I get a migraine.  
4895,41280,1.0,"Personable and caring doctor, quickly returns e-messages. "
4896,41280,1.0,"Dr. Vogt is funny, kind hearted and easy to talk to. He's nice to his nurses too, which I haven't seen much with my past doctors. I have had to wait awhile in the room for him before, but I could tell that he was trying to get to me as quickly as possible because I heard him running down the hall towards the room! I have seen him about 5 times, but there was one time that he was somewhat short with me...maybe he was just having a bad day. Overall I appreciate his bedside manner and his willingness to spend time talking me through things. "
4897,41281,1.0,"I love Dr Vicente! He is a wonderful MD! He has been helping me for the past 10 yrs. The first MD, that could put the correct medications together that work, in 20 yrs. Thank you! "
4898,41281,1.0,"6 yrs of evaluation &amp; never suggested therapy.  Was never a initial diagnosis by tests. Forgot or did not answer direct questions, asked at least twice, regarding loss of balance, what can be done about social anxieties. His response was &quot;let me think about this&quot;. Doses prescribed for certain medications where extremely high, (90 mg daily of Adderall XR). per diagnosis by hospital Psychiatrist. The Nurse on his staff failed to recognize an allergic reaction to medication and told patient needed to have head examined by Family Practitioner.  "
4899,41281,1.0,"I can't agree more with the review from 2/11/2010. Dr. V is that and more. He cares for you as a whole person and takes your physical health conditions/medications into account with your emotional conditions/medications. Out of all the doctors I see Dr. V. is the one I trust the most and believe in because of his whole person approach. He's very good at listening and talking at your level. Overall, just amazing and I thank God for him.  "
4900,41281,1.0,"Dr. Vicente is a breath of fresh air. You always feed listened to, and that he really cares. He provides careful analysis, is never judgmental or abrupt, never rushes you out the door like so many other Doctors do. Overall very pleasant and articulate. He is innovative, up on all the newest studies and medications. Not afraid to talk about nutrition, vitamins, etc. Will let patient help decide course of treatment. Democratic, not authoritative. Down to earth and friendly. Overall a very cool guy. "
4901,41281,1.0,"He is open to trying new medications, working with client.  He believes people are more than their diagnosis.  "
4902,41282,2.0,"Best doctor I ever had. Knowledgeable, detail-oriented, kind, honest. Good scientist, good person.  "
4903,41283,1.0,dr voelker is very king. knowledgeable and he takes the time to listen to you. He does not treat you like he is in a hurry to get rid of you. Very willing to answer your questions the best he can. 
4904,41284,0.0,My experience with Dr. Vogel was terrible.  She violate HIPAA regulation by not documenting patient visits.  Residents are allowed to make decision for which they are not qualified for.  She doesn't follow up on residents recommendations.   I would never recommend this physician to family or friends!!! 
4905,41285,0.0,She was very helpful to me. She listens very well and is VERY knowledgable.She has helped my other family members as well.I would recomend her to anyone.

4910,41289,1.0,"Dr. Randy Vosters is kind, caring and extreamly professional. He goes above the expected norm, spends all the time necessary and cares about each person. I take my children to him. He is great with them, and if there is ever a specific pediatric concern he consults w/ his pediatric collegues before he make a decision if needed. He provides me with infomation to inspire me to take better care of myself and the optimism to make it happen. I would recommmend him to others- but since I started doing that it isn't as easy to get an appointment with him, so maybe I won't :) "
4911,41290,0.0,She is an elitist and does not know what a &quot;real&quot; Mother or family should do. Just what the books tell her.

4913,41292,1.0,"Dr. Van Norman is double board certified as a Family Practioner, as well as an Anesthesiologist. He is very personable, has a great bedside manner, and is excellent in all situations from critical to routine. I was his assistant, and I'd trust my life in his hands any day. Erik Nilsson "
4914,41293,1.0,"terrible, hands shake and he will cause damage "
4915,41294,2.0,"Down right rude.  No interest in patient's concerns or healing, only interested if it involves cutting.  Anything slightly gray of that, you are on your own.  Bedside manor absolutely stinks.  Would not take my dog back to a place as this yet alone myself or anyone I care about at all.  Offered no idea's, solutions or actions to take to progress healing, disregarded or talked down at patient concerns and if you are in pain - suck it up... "
4916,41295,0.0,"Unlike the person above, Rebecca was nothing but helpful, caring, and understanding.  She listened to all my questions and addressed them in a language I could understand.  If you want the best care in this area, I would highly recommened her. "
4917,41295,0.0,"At first, I liked Rebecca Vissers. She is very personable &amp; listened fairly intently to my concerns. After a few visits however, she seemed very different. It was almost like she didn't believe me when I told her my symptoms, &amp; although she didn't say so directly, it was very much implied. Because she was treating me for a specific medical issue, I chose to continue with her until it was resolved since she knew my case. She wasn't very good at follow up &amp; seemed &quot;bothered&quot; that she had to continue seeing me because my condition wasn't healing at the pace she thought it should. When I later had some complications &amp; expressed my concerns, she blew me off. I attempted to share research that my husband found online, but she refused to even look at it &amp; discounted the fact that what we found was even medically relevent or correct. Because of this, we chose to get a second opinion, &amp; low &amp; behold, the research from the internet proved to be right &amp; helped them to diagnose &amp; treat me quicker.  "
4918,41296,1.0,He is an amazing doctor! He went out of his way MANY MANY times to be sure to get our child help.  Very intelligent and caring! The decisions that he makes re: therapy's and medications are very well thought out. 
4919,41296,1.0,"I did not think Dr. Vasey was a good doctor at all. He made me feel like an expieriment. And he didnt act like he cared about me at all. He treated me as if he just didnt really care what happened or not. He didnt believe anything I said, well i guess they r trained for that but he should've at least pretended he believed me. He broke apart my family. And he just ate up all of our money I mean seriously it cost over a thousand dollars a night for that place almost 2 grand!!!!! "
4920,41296,1.0,"Dr. Vasey is a sweet guy, who really cares about his patients. He really made me happy and since his scheduel changed he has been a little scary. But I don't know what I would do without him. He means the world to me. He has been like a dad to me. "
4921,41297,1.0,"Opinionated. Arrogant. Ignorant. Chauvinist... Gave his opinions instead of facts. Acted as if I were wasting his time. Didn't answer my questions, instead he judged them and told me to do more research. His assistant was unfriendly, just gave orders without explanation. Had a 3:15 appointment time (checked-in at 3:10) and waited until approximately 3:50 to be seen. "
4922,41298,1.0,"I found him to be pleasant, approachable and informative. He listened to me and my concerns and went over each question repeatedly with response.   My first appointment with him he spent 1 1/2 hours with me which is unheard of and appreciated! I would recommend him! "

4924,41298,1.0,Horrible bedside manner.  &quot;Scolded&quot; me during the birth of my first child. My experience with this doctor was the worst part of my entire birthing process.  
4925,41299,1.0,Not return return calls for days and not call in medications to pharmacy. He is leaving Naperville office 
4926,41300,1.0,"Dr. Vrabec saved my eye!  I am so grateful.  I doubt there was any other doctor in the Midwest that could've taken immediate charge of a very dire situation like he did with his incredible knowledge and expertise.  The people in his office were all caring, just terrific.  I feel blessed that I can proudly say he is my doctor.  And that I have a new cornea, in the nick of time, because of him.  "
4927,41301,1.0,"Dr.Volberding is way off the charts, way beyond a 5,  on knowledge and experience and understanding of pain and pain medications.  I know...I first met Dr. Volberding in drug treatment in 1989. And I do not meant that he ever denied me access to pain meds when I really needed them. In fact, I had major surgery a week after leaving drug treatment. He managed the whole thing, and did a wonderful job.   He has long since left my life, but he is taking care of my mother and brother now.  "
4928,41301,1.0,"His specialist referrals aren't that good, but he does seem to care. "
4929,41302,1.0,"I LOVED my ped that retired, so I was not thrilled to take the &quot;new&quot; guy and much to my pre-set notions, Dr. Paul Veldhosue is a knowledgable, caring and relates to my middle aged children well!! He's a GREAT doctor.  He's complete in is analysis also.  I Like him! I look forward to growing up with him.  "

4932,41304,1.0,"This is not the right forum for legal issues. Google WCCA and do a simple search, put in his name, and that should give you enough to run. This man is reckless and only cares about money. Run, while you stil can! "
4933,41304,1.0,"Cancel appointments and get a better. Opinion,  this one is not it! "
4934,41304,1.0,They do not care after your 3 months are up after surgery. They are not helpful at all as far as the assistants go. The front desk help are hardly ever smiling and as far as after surgery and 3 months are up and you are still in pain oh well live with it and as the hospitol stay was horrible.  I was given a bed pan and sat in my own poop for over 20 minutes 
4935,41304,1.0,"Very informative, delayed plans to talk to me. Prescribed a medication that helped in three days.  "
4936,41304,1.0,"Can't  believe this guy rated competent. Both head of neuro at Med School of Wis and head of ortho at UW med school think he is incompetent frequently overcharges  Paid  3 million last year for a malpractice case of operation on wrong side, concealment from client, misinformaion to other Docs . How can yu rate this guy competent&#63;&#63;&#63; "
4937,41304,1.0,worst mistake I ever made was to see this guy. 
4938,41305,1.0,Dr. Westreich is a wonderful individual who really cares about his clients and his profession.  I would highly recommend him to anyone looking for a great doctor. 
4939,41305,1.0,"I swore I'd never see a male gynecologist.  After an ER visit one day I really had no choice but to followup with Dr. Westreich.  I was very nervous but too tired of my problem to complain.  My husband came with me for support and I really needed that but Dr. Westreich was fantastic.  He actually listed to me and suggested a good plan of action.  He's the first doctor I've ever met, gyn or otherwise, that has really cared about the patient.  "

4941,41306,1.0,"An awesome doctor. Efficient, kind, compassionate, interested in his patients, professional, experienced, and knowledgeable. I'm TTC and Dr. Waters has been very helpful along the way. "
4942,41306,1.0,"I would recommend Dr.Waters to anyone-he's friendly, efficient, easy to talk to, and very thorough. The only reason I had to give only 4 stars for on time was that I had to wait an hour for my procedure because he was busy delivering a baby :) "
4943,41306,1.0,I used Dean insurance. He is the best OB/GYN I have ever been to. Great bedside manner and professional in the office. Love him 
4944,41306,1.0,"This doc filled in for my regular doctor when I need my annual pap and pelvic exam. Not a procedure anyone likes to go through, but this doctor was friendly, efficient, took my mind off it by talking about favorite bands and radio stations. Great! "
4945,41306,1.0,"Since Dr. Waters started helping us with fertility issues three years ago, we now have 2 beautiful children. We don't plan to have any more children and my only regret is that I will miss him dearly! He is a great doctor and the referral we received to him was the best advice I have ever received. "
4946,41306,1.0,I go to him even though he's outside of my provider list. He's that good!!! 
4947,41307,1.0,"Most arrogant prick you will ever meet.  Epitome of a selfish, egotistic doctor.  All he ever talks about is his daughter in Medical School.  Also, if you are young and looking at a career in Healthcare, don't mention it to him.  If your grades are sub-par, or simply not a 4.0, he will tell you to be realistic and know that there is no chance they are going to accept you.  He honestly is one of the arrogant human beings, and certainly someone who shouldn't be in healthcare.  He simply does not know how to CARE for his patients.  "
4948,41307,1.0,. he is pleasant and concerned 
4949,41308,1.0,Extremely knowledgeable and competent. Good educator and understanding.  
4950,41308,1.0,I noticed while waiting in the Waiting Room patients leaving the office all had smiles on their faces.  Sure made me feel good about being the next patient to see the Doctor - and it was just that - a good experience.  Dr Watchmaker was eager to work around my schedule to schedule the very minor procedure in order to have it done as soon as possible.  The Doctor is a very nice person and he knows his &quot;stuff&quot;.  
4951,41308,1.0,Highly recommend. Everyone friendly. Physician explained in great manner and offered options. Efficient. 
4952,41308,1.0,Very respectful staff and friendly! They listen and Dr. Watchmaker was very clear and explained so that i would understand. I was grateful to be able to explain what I felt was wrong and have it all confirmed and then a course of action given.  Thank you so much! 
4953,41308,1.0,Outstanding in every way!  I was very impressed.  Doctor was thorough and knowledgable and gained my confidence.  He had excellent references from others. 
4954,41308,1.0,"I have Anthem/Blue Cross supplement.        Dr. Watchmaker was very professional, explained my condition to my satisfaction and has a very warm, pleasant manner.  I felt very confident in his expertise.   Helen Polacheck "
4955,41308,1.0,"I am a big baby and had a giant cell tumor on my finger that wrapped itself around my joint.  After day surgery, 19 stitches later &amp; therapy along with follow up visits, I can honestly say &quot;I didn't feel a thing.&quot;  No pain! I didn't have feeling in my finger for a while, but through more therapy and concern by Dr. Watchmaker, I got it back!  They are there for you through everything and every concern.   Highly recommend Dr. Watchmaker and have to several people already who are also happy with him.  "
4956,41308,1.0,"I went to Dr. Watchmaker for tendinitis. He sent me to a clinic for therapy for one month. The therapy was successful, and I have not been troubled by the condition for the seven years that have elapsed since treatment.  Can't do better than that! "

4959,41308,1.0,The staff and dr are top notch and I would recommend them to everyone.   I had carpal tunnel surgery and healed great! 
4960,41308,1.0,Feel like the staff care very much about my good  treatment. 
4961,41308,1.0,"Watchmaker is god.  He is competent, confident, knowledgable, curteous, and everything else that is great. "
4962,41308,1.0,"Dr. Watchmaker and his staff are truly excellent; highly professional, friendly, and he and the staff take the time to answer questions and reassure you.  Highly recommend them.  "
4963,41308,1.0,Dr. Watchmaker and his staff are awesome.My husband injured his hand cut through 3 tendons and a optical nerve.Dr. Watchmaker kept us informed of every procedure every risk every option available. His staff is also as dedicated to keeping his patients comfortable and informed. Before and after surgery made sure that all of our needs were met.I would recommend Dr. Watchmaker and his staff to anyone who should ask.Thank you from the bottom of our hearts Dr. Watchmaker. The Family Robles 
4964,41308,1.0,"I cannot praise Dr. Watchmaker and his staff enough for their service to me. In 2006 I had surgery for a bone growth on my hand and found my recovery to be pain free. I went to an occupational therapist named Sheri who was recommended by Dr. Watchmaker. Believe it or not, I actually looked forward to my sessions. She was extremely knowledgeable, friendly, and understanding since she had the same surgery that I did.  "
4965,41308,1.0,"Dr. Watchmaker in my opinion is excellent! I had bicep tendon repair using endo button technique. My strength is completely back and I don't really notice any loss of motion. Dr. Watchmaker explained the procedure completely and I was totally confident in his ability, I would highly recommend him to anyone. The therapist he used at Aurora was superb and a pleasure to work with (Cheri), and his secretary Danica was most helpful and a pleasure to talk to. A team that cannot be beat. "
4966,41308,1.0,"Dr. Watchmaker did surgery on my hand after I cut a couple tendons. Although he is not the most social doctor in the world (I think I talked to him all of 5 minutes before the operation), his staff in the physical therapy department at Aurora are wonderful. He also is VERY good at what he does. I was worried about never playing my violin again after the cut, but I was up and playing again in a month or two. Wonderful. "
4967,41309,1.0,"Excellent Doctor! Very caring, very approachable, very knowledgeable along with being very responsive to his patients needs. Couldn't ask for a better doctor. Wish we had more like him in health care. "
4968,41309,1.0,"Prob one of the most caring and knowledgable physicans out there-esp for urologists. I'm a patient as well as a nurse. He called me on his off day to tell me my CT scan results (unheard of typically, esp with specialists). Tells you to call him anytime and he ALWAYS calls you back. Gives you the actual (copy) reports on any scans or tests you've had done when you see him in his office. Also- other doctors in other specialies like him and recommend him over and over. I see he's listed under &quot;surgeon, specialty&quot; on this website if you need more reviews.  "
4969,41310,1.0,Dr Weirich was very sweet.    He is very funny which takes away the awkwardness 
4970,41310,1.0, 
4971,41312,2.0,"Very helpful, good listener.  "
4972,41313,1.0,"Outstanding caring Physician.  Office staff is excellent, especially nurse Judy.  Thoughtful, caring,the staff goes above and beyond.  This is a highly knowledgeable Physician who really cares about his patient's.  Sometimes there is a wait in the office, but he is worth the wait.  They explain all treatment and alternatives in a easy to understand way.  He is always a phone call away if you need emergency help. They always return phone calls.  Highly recommended.  "
4973,41314,0.0,"Actually Forward Dental is exactly on par with regional averages.  In fact their annual price changes reflect the exact regional average price. I looked into this.  Besides, no matter what they charge your insurance has negotiated allowable charges and the difference cannot be charged to the patient.  Patient copays come from the amount left over after your insurance pays the percentage of the allowable they cover.  "
4974,41314,0.0,Forward Dental is the office she works at. They charge way more then the regional medium and you insurance pays on the # so you end up paying way too much. Checked with several other dentist offices in the area and all their charges for the same services were considerably lower. Do NOT go to forward dental!!!! 
4975,41315,1.0,"Dr. West has been my obgyn for eight years now he delivered all three of children via c-section. I met him the day i delivered my first born and with many complications he was the only one who took me seriously all the other doctors kept telling me i was fine and nothing was wrong indeed that was not the case had it not been for Dr. West i would have lost my baby. he has been my obgyn ever since and is always honest with me about everything, he's alwasy very willing to answer all of my questions and to even sit there and repeat himself until i understand. West and his staff have always been very understanding and sincere in all of my care. I dont trust very many doctors and he is honestly one of three that i do trust with not only my health but the health of my children to.  "
4976,41316,1.0,He spent plenty of time explaining what  was going on. Made my stay in eth ER almost tolerable 
4977,41317,1.0,"Told me I couldn't go into the room w/my 5 yr old. It was his first exam ever. frustrating. Then he said i can't get the contacts i've worn for years, saying they are discontinued. Even though I called Ciba Vision and they still have them. Who is the patient&#63;&#63; How can they do business like this&#63;&#63; "
4978,41318,1.0,"Dr. Wallace is a very kind and understanding Dr. He is always willing to answer questions and doesn't rush you out of the office to get to his next patient. Yet, he is usually on time with his appointments. He is great with the kids. He also specializes in internal medicine.  "
4979,41319,1.0,"Kind, caring, knowledgeable.  A true gem of a doctor.  Dr Warpinski will go out of his way to give you the best care.  He spends time with his patients, is honest and sensitive to patients' feelings and treats everyone like family.  He is extremely knowlegeable and professional. His staff and all of his patients that Ive met absolutely love him.   I would highly recommend him to anyone in need of a great allergist/asthma specialist! "

4985,41323,1.0,Hi Doctor Wetzler you delivered my full term son in 1997 You were a great doctor very compassionate   I wish you were still here I need my medical records and I don't no where to get them. You have been gone for many years now and the world was brighter with you here. I really need you but your gone   that makes me sad.  
4986,41323,1.0,"Dr. Wetzler delivered all 3 of my children. I almost named my first son after him, I love Dr. Wetzler so much. Now they are 19, 18 and 13 and all I have are fond memories of Dr. Wetzler and his caring, compassionate attitude.  He truely is a caring person who does the best for his patients.  I don't really care what anybody else says, nobody will change my mind about Dr. Wetzler.  He puts his patients first, he's an educational Dr., his bedside manner is unlike no other Dr. and I wouldn't trade him for the world! "
4987,41323,1.0,I dont think how I pay for my visit is relivant.Dr Wetzler is a beautiful man. He has an awesome damenor.And I personally think is one of the very few docs who actually listen and care about your well being. All of you people who bash don't know him.And further more the reported deaths&#63;Those people chose to not take there medicine as perscribe.I have chronic pain.And don't abuse my meds. so why should we have suffer a few that do&#63; Hey Doc! When r u reopening&#63; Hopefully soon.Take care! 
4988,41323,1.0,DR Wetzlers clinic allows you the person who is ill to feel human again and as though you have a purpose once more in life All Drs Could gain from observing his bedside/pateint side manners .Recently Dr Wetzlers clinic has been under fire for matters not within their control this is a shame . 
4989,41323,1.0,I went to his office over the period of tow years...besides the long wait it's worth it if you dont have insurance...I would def reccomend him becuae of all the years of knowledge and practice he has...he has never failed me yet! 
4990,41323,1.0,besides the long wait....this is one of the most caring doctors i have ever had.. 
4991,41323,1.0,Dr Bob IS AWESOME he is always caring and if you need to talk for a minute he is always there for you please leave him alone and stop being jealous that he is such a nice person and you aren't 
4992,41323,1.0,"To begin with, you have to wait all day long for your scheduled appt. They have a very bad habit of double and even triple booking patients.  If your appt. is for 9:00a.m. your lucky if your out of their by 2:00p.m. NO LIE! Other than that if you have an entire day to kill than this is the place for you.  Also, what the hell is up with the no insurance thing&#63;  I mean I have great insurance but am forced to pay them cash!  Why&#63;  What the hell reason is it that I go to work&#63;  Really though.........As far as clenliness goes thats another entire story.  I've seen Citgo gas stations that are cleaner.  No T.V. or magazines to read to pass the time.  And I do mean ALOT of time!  All and all, good luck to all who dare to take this place on.  Happy Holidays! "
4993,41323,1.0,"Intelligent,Friendly with a good sence of humor. He will help you "
4994,41323,1.0,Dr. Wetzler is a great guy! He was my Dr. when I lived in WI. He had then spec. in ob/gyn. A hard act to fllow as they don't seem to breed dr's of his quality any more. 
4995,41323,1.0,"GREAT DOCTOR AND STAFF - SERIOUS NATURE, HAS ODD FACIAL EXPRESSIONS AND SUCH, BUT AFTER EXAMINING ALL YOUR RECORDS, MRIS, ETC - HE ASKS YOU A SERIES OF QUESTIONS AND DOES SOME PHYSICAL TESTS ON YOU. HIS NURSE CINDY IS DYNAMITE AND BELINDA THE RECEPTIONIST IS ALSO GREAT. THE WHOLE STAFF OPERATES TOGETHER QUITE WELL. IF YOU CAN PUT UP WITH THE NOT-SO-NEW OFFICE ENVIRONMENT, I THINK YOU WILL FIND THE DOC TO BE A MAN OF UNDERSTANDING, PATIENCE AND EMPATHY. THE TEAM, VERY COMPASIONATE AND FUN PEOPLE. THEY SEEM TO HAVE THEIR ACT TOGETHER. DOC IS VERY CAREFUL ABOUT PRESCRIBING ANY SCED II MEDS AND IS ANTI-OXYCONTIN DUE TO THE HIGH ABUSE POTENTIAL AND ALL THE NEWS (ABUSE, DEATH, ETC). SO FAR I AM PLEASED WITH LEVEL OF CARE I AM RECEIVING. AFTER TRYING ABOUT 10-12 DIFFERENT DOCS IN MILW, I AM HAPPY TO BE A PATIENT OF DR. WETZLER AND RECOMMEND HIM HIGHLY. "
4996,41323,1.0,"I was seen at Riverwest Clinic 208 E Capitol Dr. in Milwaukee without insurance for a reasonable fee. They also offer a 'whole body' approach to healthcare which i found refreshing for a clinic serving patients without insurance. They offer psychiatric care, chiropractic care as well as acupuncture. I was very impressed! ***** "
4997,41324,1.0,"Dr. Wade is a resident in the General Surgery Department. He took extra time to explain the operation after my surgeon had already tried to explain it, and he used plain english. He was very reassuring. "
4998,41325,1.0,"The courtesy and care is outstanding. This doctor is  very professional, personable and willing to work with his patients and their concerns. He suggests the least invasive procedure to correct foot problems with great success.  "
4999,41325,1.0,Dr. Wiessman and Northwest Surgery was very professional.  I had my bunion taken care of and am very pleased with the results. 
5000,41326,1.0,"We planned for a birth under the care of a midwife. However, late in the pregnancy, our baby flipped breach and required version for any chance of a natural delivery. Our midwife connected us with Dr. Wasserman, and we couldn't be happier. He made himself available to transfer care despite never having met us. He scheduled the version for the next day, but we didn't make it that far. Thankfully, he again came through for us, coming in to the hospital when he wasn't on call or on duty, and working with us to ensure our hopes for our baby's birth were realized despite a C-section being imminent. Post surgery he checked on me and our baby in the NICU. His follow up care prior to my wife's hospital discharge was impressive. When we mentioned we were cash patients, he helped keep costs to a minimum by moving up my wife's discharge. Dr. Wasserman learned of our case one day, met us and delivered our baby the next day, and through it all listened to and treated us with respect and dignity. "
5001,41326,1.0,Dr. Wasserman: great if you like you doctor arrogant and you are desperate.  
5002,41326,1.0,Fun and friendly personality.  Very knowledgalbe and is also very caring.  He takes the time to listen to your questions and concerns.   He doesn't treat you like you are just another patient! 
5003,41326,1.0,"Excellent physician. Compassionate and caring. He delivered my 2 children, my 3 nieces and nephews, and does OBGYN for myself, my mom,and all my sisters.  "
5004,41326,1.0,He is a wonderful dr. he brought both my grandchildren into this world.. steena and akie.. Thank you dr. Wasserman! We love you. 
5005,41326,1.0,md has no compassion or care for pts pain. doing painful procedures without anesthesia. could not accomplish getting samples for biopsy despite doing it multiple times. 
5006,41326,1.0,Dr Wasserman is truly on of a kind. He really listens to his patients and treats them as intelligent human beings who are partners in their care. He is a big supporter of a woman's right to choose the kind of birth she wants to have under his care. 
5007,41326,1.0,"Dr. Wasserman is a rare OB who truly practices evidence-based medicine and who always puts the needs of his patients first. Because of his work as a state representative, his scheduling can be limited at times, but when he commits to a time, he's always there. I can't rate him highly enough! "
5008,41327,0.0,So far my experience with her has been really good. I only waited ten minutes. She spent a lot of time asking personal questions and getting to know me. Performed a thorough medical exam. I was unsure of whether I wanted to get a difficult procedure done and she talked with me in detail about pros and cons. I corresponded back and forth with her about it and she wrote detailed notes about it. Her office immediately returned phone calls and were prompt and nice. The only down side was she wasn't as familiar as I would like on the condition that I might have. One of the best doctors I have gone to in a long time. 
5009,41327,0.0,"Dr. Weiss was very understanding and compassionate in examining my father for suspected Parkinson's.  She was very pleasant, friendly, and patient with all of my questions and concerns.  She treated my father with respect and compassion.   An excellent neurologist! "
5010,41327,0.0,"The worst &quot;bedside manner&quot; I have ever encountered in a physician. She was extremely disrespectful (eyerolling, sneering.)  Didn''t take any time to answer my questions or concerns. She just blew me off.    Also, completely insensitive to privacy concerns.  Very unprofessional.          "
5011,41327,0.0,"Did not treat me as a person, but as a thing. I did not feel that this doctor respected me as a person. She was extremely uncommunicative about the problem for which I was seeing her. Either she or her office is not good about following through on issues such as referral to other specialists, referrals for second opinions, or referrals to physical and occupational therapy. "
5012,41329,0.0,I went to her to get a second opinon and she was so informative and extremely nice.  She took over an hour with me and was very thorough. Answered all my questions no matter hoe many times I asked them.  I would definitly recommend her to anyone.-She was one of the nicest docotrs I had ever seen. 
5013,41329,0.0, 
5014,41330,0.0,Sent my sister to hospital to detox off of her psych meds-she was on several diff anti-depressants &anti-anxiety.Hosp; just stopped giving meds &amp; sent her home. Dr W called prim phys told her not to represcribe ANY meds cuz she was overmedicated giving that Dr impression she was overseeing detox &amp; then called to say she would not be seeing my sister again cuz she was too complicated a case.Left my sister extremely vulnerable w/o any Dr-her prim was on vacation-to go thru W/D confused scared &amp; in a tremendous amount of pain with no orders to be followed @ assisted living home over a weekend.  If not medical malpractice certainly close! 
5015,41331,0.0,"This doctor sent her 2 residents in to look at me for an hour.  When she came in, she didn't even check my back, just told me I had back pain, prescribed pain patches,  told me to continue with PT, said I'd have to live with this pain for the rest of my life, and wouldn't send me for an MRI.  A year later,  my disk ruptured. It turns out that my pain was due to a bulging disk that was causing muscle spasms.  Now,  it's a long road to recovery.   Too bad she didn't take the time to examine me.  I was even crying in her office and she couldn't utter one kind word of reassurance.  She treated me like it was all in my head/not as bad as I was making it out.  How unfortunate.  "
5016,41331,0.0,"Although the cash amount I paid is small to this Doctor, I have paid large amounts in terms of my health status changes since being injured. This Doctor and her staff works hard to make life easier and not more difficult for their patients. Coping with WC, puts more stress on the individual by tons. Being able to go to a Doctor who understands this but helps work to stop your pain is invaluable.  I thank God for her wonderful care and for her caring staff as well! "
5017,41332,2.0,Seems to take a personslinterest in me. good follow up on testing.  
5018,41333,2.0,Always on top of things. 
5019,41334,1.0,Dr. Weber delivered both of my children and was absolutely fantastic.  He always listened and took the time to address any of my concerns. 
5020,41335,1.0,"I went to dr. wanserski to be fitted with dentures. He did a thorough exam and saved to tooth roots which had a gold bar attacked to them. I had a tooth in the lower jaw that never came up ad dissolved in the bone weakening the lower jaw. I have had the dentures 10 years and never had a denture sore form a bad fit or a problem with them.  I have had to have check up and have needed to cancel and reschedule and am always treated well. Dr, wanserski even worked on a week end to get the plate done so we could complete all the work brfore my dental insurance ran out.  I recommend him to evertone.  He matched the tooth color in my dentures so close to my actual ones and the fit is so good that noone realizes I wear them, not even my aunt. "
5021,41335,1.0,I went to a Dr. David Wanserski for a TMJ splint and he made me a splint that was so big and bad that he took one and a half hours pulling it in and out of my mouth to adjust it. I've had splints previously and it usually only took the dentist 15 minutes to adjust the splint. Dr. Wanserski pulled the splint into and out of my mouth for 1 and a half hours till my lips were dry and cracking. Not only that but the splint he made put my jaw in a backward incorrect position which caused me to have dozens of muscle knots in my neck and shoulders at all times and I had to wear a neck brace and ride in a medivan to appointments. He adjusted the splint and made it so thin that it had holes in it. It broke several times while I was chewing with it (that's what it was designed for)and it had to be repaired. He later refused to repair it and so I had to wear it with broken jagged edges in my mouth.I complained to the Prosthodontic Peer Review Committee and nothing was done about it. 
5022,41336,1.0,Best exam ever. He even showed me pictures of the inside  of my eye. Very knowledgeable. Very nice.  All very easy. Got my bifocals in 3 days. Will definitely go back always! Didn't have to wait. 
5023,41337,2.0,. Great 
5024,41338,1.0,"Not recommended.  Dr Waldman spent less than 5 minutes with me during my appointment.  He was  not sincere, and did not seem interested in answering  my questions.  The day after meeting with him, I made an appointment to visit a different podiatrist. "

5031,41343,0.0,"I was already nervous about seeing a doctor (I hadn't been to a doctor in nearly ten years), but the pain in the left side of my abdomen was getting  worse and was affecting my work.  (A lady from work had convinced me to go.) When I saw Dr. Weber, she was very congenial, but she ignored the symptoms that I thought were relevant.  After performing a pap smear, a rectal exam, and physically pushing on my abdomen, she determined it was a pulled muscle.  I KNOW what a pulled muscle feels like, and this was not a pulled muscle.  I had explained that I had had this pain for around three months and it wasn't going away.  She insisted it was a pulled muscle, and when I questioned if the pain during intercourse had anything to do with it, she simply provided new positions to try.  It has been another two months and I am still experiencing pain (it has gotten worse) but I am terrified to go through this again and have not returned to the dr.  "
5032,41343,0.0,"I sent my mother to Dr Weber for lower abdomenal pain and spot bleeding. she told my mother she was fine and that her symtoms were comon for dieters &#63; obviously,my mother remained in pain, so I called and scedualed her back to see weber w/same complaints a week later , again she sent my mother home congradulating her on losing 3 lbs. after much prodding and 2 additional weeks of pain I convinced my mother to make another appointment and stess the pain and spotting to the Dr. again she was sent away with the diagnosis that it was nothing and comon for older woman dieting. I then, the same day in great concern called my gynocologyst whom was taking no more patients, explained my moms situation and my gyno agreed to see her that week, I went with my mom to my gyno and she was diagnosed that day with cancer and my Doctor cancelled a day of her vacation that week to do surgery on my mom. (bless Dr. Reeb-Albas heart). Dr.  Weber leaves me with great concerns!!!!!!! "
5033,41343,0.0,"Person below me is hypochondriac. Fine doctor, McGill grads know all. "
5034,41343,0.0,When I was very sick and went to see her she told me I had the flu and actually rolled me over to the New London Family Medical Center hospital ER herself and they put a mask on me and diagnosed me with the flu. I wasnt getting any better in fact I was getting worse. And I returned to her and she sent me to ER again and said i had the flu. finally when I was so bad I couldn't handle it. I went to the ER at  St. Elizabeths hospital in Appleton Wis. At first they saw the diagnosis of me having the flu so they treated me as if I did and had me wearing a mask. Then they took tests and also a flu test and found out I didn't have the flu at all. Like I tried to explain to Dr Weber in the first place. The diagnosed me with having severe Asthmatic Broncitis and it was close to pnuemonia. I have asthma and it was in my lungs. From that day on I never saw that Dr. Weber again. As far as I am concerned she is not Knowledgable to be a  doctor.  
5035,41344,2.0, 
5036,41345,0.0,"She was incredibly unhelpful and very abrupt. I came in with three separate issues. She disregarded one, somewhat helped with the second and gave me a treatment I had already tried for the third (which I did explain to her). I have had to find another doctor to address the issues I came to her with. I would never recommend her to anyone else, as my appointment with her was a complete waste of my time and money. She was neither helpful or able to reasonably explain her reasons for treating my issues the way she did. "
5037,41345,0.0,Called to try and squeeze in to see any derm with my body rash.  She had a cancellation and was able to see me. She was pleasant and knowledgeable.  Really liked her. Highly recommend.  
5038,41345,0.0,I waited a very long time for appointments.  The dr. never cured my condition.  Charged A LOT!!!  They told me they would charge me a certain amount for each treatment and it ended up being 8 times more than that.  Then they lied about telling me what they would charge me.  I had to go to another dermatologist to cure me.  The new one helped me in a couple of weeks.  
5039,41345,0.0,"Dr. Wells is extremely knowledgeble and helpful. Appointments with dermatoligists are never long, and you usually feel short changed after your 10 minute appointment you waited 3 months for, however, Dr. Wells is very thorough and helpful. When you leave, you will feel satisfied. And, if not, calling her office is very helpful also. You probably won't talk to her, but her staff is very experienced. I recommend her to anybody.  "
5040,41346,1.0,Saw the doctor when blood pressure went up during pregnancy. Was understanding and explained everything. If I didn't already have a pediatrician I would go to him as a secondary. 
5041,41347,2.0,A wonderful and very competent surgeon! 
5042,41348,0.0,Friendly and listens but got little feedback from her. 
5043,41348,0.0,"Dr. Whitaker always devotes as much time as needed to the care of my family.  She is very knowledgeable, yet comes across as a friend.  She listens to all concerns and at the end of an appointment is sure to ask if there is anything else.  I never feel rushed or foolish for coming to her with any need. "
5044,41349,2.0,You Should have a 10 rating for doctor Nicholas Webber 
5045,41350,0.0,"Dr. Bruce has been our choice for the family for many years. He is available when you have a broken tooth, even on a Saturday. Can your current dentist say the same. Deb is wonderful about getting you in on short notice. If you have questions with your insurance she will know the answer or find the answer for you. Melissa is the best at calming the nerves or just explaining all that is going to be done.  If you are looking for a new dentist, give Dr. Bruce a call. You will be happy you did. Now show off that beautiful smile courtesy of Dr Bruce and his staff.  "

5051,41353,1.0,"I saw him for a 2nd opinion for cervical spine surgery, sent by my neurologist. My symptoms did not match the MRI and the first M.D. I saw wanted to treat the MRI, not the symptoms. Weissman felt I needed further testing via a myleogram, as MRI's do not show bone very well. The myleogram showed that I needed surgery on the vertebral levels causing the symptoms and not the vertebral levels the first M.D. had planned to operate. I can't say enough good things about his excellent diagnostic skills! Needless to say, he did the surgery and I was back riding horses 3 months later. "
5052,41354,1.0,"Dr. Wagener has been my OBGYN since the birth of my first daughter 7 years ago.  He is very caring and reassuring.  I have never found a doctor who listens like he does and works so hard to find out what is really wrong.  His nurse is great, and will remember you personally.  He is always on time-unless he has an emergency delivery-which is completely understandable.  He is never rude, and always has a kind word.  He is one of those doctors that will say hello if he sees you walking down the hallway, and know who you are.  All three of my deliveries were hard, and he throuroughly discussed the alternatives, making me feel as though I had an informed choice.  I will continue to see DR. Wagener until he is no longer practicing.  Absolutely wonderful doctor! "
5053,41354,1.0,Dr Wagner has been my surgeon for 3 years & he saved my life. He'll go out of his way to help you any way he can. 
5054,41356,1.0,Dr Wagener is fantastic! I've had him as my OB for 2 babies now. He is completely open minded and doesn't pressure patients. He remembers personal concerns and does his absolute best to stick to birth plans.  Amazing OB! 
5055,41357,2.0,"Closed off and unfriendly, not very helpful with my problems, would not recommend.  "
5056,41358,1.0,This guy is different w/ no bedside manner or ability to talk with the patient or their family. He never made it a point to confer with the family of a hospitalized patient. 
5057,41359,0.0,I have been going to Dr.Welniak for several years thru Aurora and love her! I hav been advised she left Aurora and am trying to find out where she went so I can continue to be treated by her.  Does anybody know&#63; 
5058,41359,0.0,"She is the most kind,caring, and thorough  doctor I have yet to see in my 26 years. All of my medical issues were dealt with in a compassionate manner. I'm very glad I found her.  "
5059,41359,0.0,"I saw her for about 2 years and found her to be sometimes nice but other times condescending, mean, and unhelpful. After the second time I left her office in tears I got a new doctor and was properly diagnosed and treated for Hashimoto's.  "
5060,41360,1.0,Dr Wang is very knowledgeable.  He helped restore my sight after a freak neurological incident that caused me to wake up from a surgery completely blind.  He is very even tempered and soft spoken.  He really makes you feel like he cares about you as a patient.   He really knows his stuff too! 
5061,41361,0.0,"Very friendly and if she is not available, then you can always get an appt with a different doctor in the office.  "
5062,41362,2.0,Excellent Dentist. Good bedside manner.  Friendly assistant 
5063,41363,0.0,"I had a very bad experience. From the booking to the appointment, everyone in the office was very strange. Assistant said that doc was odd and she was looking for another job. There were cords laying on the floor and 10 lb. weights for when the doc gets overwhelmed. The doc acts like he does not know how to use the equipment. He asked me how much money I had saved for medical expenses and then wanted to charge me that amount for contacts and glasses, which I did not order either from him. Another patient came in the room where we were and gave the doc a neck massage while the doc was giving an audible response to this man massaging him. When I said that I would not be ordering anything because the cost was almost double what I normallt pay, he reached in my purse and pulled out an eyeglass perscription that he had written up for my employer's safety glass program. He also called my employer to try to persuade them to let me buy the safety glasses from him. It was horrible.  "
5064,41364,1.0,He is very up to date and &quot;in the now&quot; with oral hygiene and health. Teaches about disease prevention not treating when the disease arrives. 
5065,41365,2.0,dr. drilled to and exposed a large portion of nerve covered it with a poorly smooth metal filling. Child 16 year old football palyer. Crying ... Dr. refused to help child. Forced to go to another dentist for relieve of pain.  BAD doctor !!! 
5066,41366,1.0,"unfortunately, Dr. Wait is no longer with us. He passed away two weeks ago. "
5067,41366,1.0,"Had him with my 3rd child.  Great OB, wonderful sense of humor, very knowledgeable.  However, he did move to Wausau and started practicing there last summer (June 09) so no longer in Madison.  If you are in the Wausau area, however, I highly recommend him. "
5068,41366,1.0,I have been a patient of Dr. Wait for nine years.  He has delivered all three of my children via c-section.  Never before has a doctor made me feel like I was his only patient.  He actually LISTENED to my concerns and never made me feel embarrassed or ashamed of any question I had. I highly recommend Dr. Wait if you are looking for a real human being to trust with health during this amazing and scary time of your life. 
5069,41366,1.0,"I have had a great experience with this OB.  He's personable, easy to talk to, and very caring. He has a great sense of humor.  He makes me feel totally comfortable and I feel like I can ask him anything.  He loves his patients and looks out for us.  I love his philosophy about having babies- very supportive yet he doesn't like to intervene with the natural process unless neccessary. "
5070,41367,1.0,This was my first visit to Dr.  Wenninger and I was very pleased with the visit and with the staff and lab employees! 
5071,41367,1.0,Dr. Wenninger has always been very kind and attentive to me. I have had no problems during the 4 years I have been a patient. 
5072,41367,1.0,"When questioned about treatment, he snapped and said &quot;if you don't like the treatment, go to someone else.&quot;  Which I did. "
5073,41368,2.0,I am very satisfied with all the areas rated.  
5074,41369,1.0,Very personable and friendly. He talked with my family and made them feel like he really cared. I think he is a rare caring doctor. 
5075,41370,1.0,I didn't feel he said more than three words to me about what was going on with my tooth. He didn't explain what he was going to do or why. He didn't appeared to have looked at my chart as I had to remind him of an important piece of information it contained. when I told him of my tooth problem he responded with &quot;poor baby&quot; 
5076,41371,2.0,"Great doc, one of the smartest men I've ever met. Thorough workup, thorough treatment. "
5077,41372,1.0,Wonderful surgeon.  I trust my life with him 
5078,41372,1.0,Wonderful Doctor.  Very Caring and knowledgable. 
5079,41373,1.0,He is AWESOME!  I've been with his since I was pregnant with my first child and I hope to be with him much much longer.  Works with your ideas instead of telling you what you HAVE to do.  
5080,41373,1.0,"He is our family doctor.  Excellent bedside manner.  Christian, which is important to us.  Does not push drugs/medications if they're not necessary.  He truly has a heart for his patients.  He delivered my last child in 2002 and we have been seeing him since.  He is very good about calling you if you leave a message.  "
5081,41373,1.0,I have been going to Dr. Walker for the past 6 years. He is the only person I trust with my family. He is a wonderful man who really cares about his patients. 
5082,41374,0.0,"Dr.Westberg was easy to talk to, spent time talking &amp; educating me, and was equally great with the kids.  We all love her! "
5083,41375,1.0,Dr. Webb is very kind and very helpful.  He specializes in addiction medicine.  It would be helpful to his patients if he spent a little more time learning or updating his knowledge on bipolar and major depression.  
5084,41375,1.0,Dr. Webb is very punctual and very helpful. He is open to new ideas and he always has time to listen to your issues. 
5085,41376,2.0, 
5086,41377,1.0,"Have had Dr. Warpinski as my GP since he began practicing back in the 1980's.  I have had complete confidence in him so much that I have stayed with him even though he has changed locations on several occasions.  He currently is 25 miles away, yet I still travel to him because of his genuine care for his patients.  I have suffered with Diabetes, A-Fiberlation, Obesity, Hypertension, etc.  But I trust my life with Dr. Warpinski.   He is the BEST! "
5087,41377,1.0,"Dr. Warpinski was my GP for a number of years, and had it not been for a recent change in insurance he still would be. I had pretty severe asthma when I was a kid and he was pivotal in getting it under control.. He has never been hesitant to refer me to a specialist when necessary. He makes sure you understand and are comfortable with everything. I understand he also offers spiritual support if you want that sort of thing. I, however, have not asked for nor been asked about it in any visit to him. He's a wonderful doctor for your whole family. "
5088,41377,1.0,"If you are overweight, every single diagnosis will be focused on that; regardless of symptoms.  He is very condescending and rude with his presentation.  If you are not religious he is also very judgmental toward you.  I will not be returning to this practice.  His staff is amazing.  Nurses are very helpful, kind and attentive.  He is an arrogant jerk.  "
5089,41377,1.0,"Dr. Luke and his staff are exceptional in all areas. Dr. Warpinski serves the medical, emotional and spiritual needs of his patients AS APPROPRIATE for the individual.  His knowledge and willingness to refer, when appropriate, are exceptional.  He is approachable in medically complicated, painful and emotionally difficult situations. Patient care and concern are evident from the moment of entering his office.  Patients and family are greeted with a warm smile and friendly voice.  Billing is addressed in a helpful and open style. I showed financial responsibility when a delay in insurance payment was brought to my attention.  Good faith payment was requested, but service was not denied.  Prescribing medication is taken seriously and an appointment is required  Dr. Luke and his staff show impressive patient sensitivity. "
5090,41378,1.0,Excellent physician.  Really knows his stuff and willing to explain things to you.  Everyone I know that has him loves him. 
5091,41379,1.0,Seemed very arrogant.  Listened but didn't seem like he &quot;really&quot; cared about his patient(s).  
5092,41380,1.0,Awesome pediatric cardiologist. He diagnosed our son in utero and is beyond friendly and knowledgeable. We have total trust in him and would recommend him to anyone. One of the nicest doctors we have ever met! 
5093,41381,1.0,"Excellent result, trouble free, pleasure to work with "
5094,41381,1.0,I had a procedure done and he did not even do half of what he said he was going to do. Then when I went back to ask him about it he told me he never said that. I can not believe this guy. Be very careful and tape record your convesations with him. This guy should not be allowed to be a Dr. I think he just wanted the money and business. 
5095,41382,0.0,"Toni is great, she really makes you comfortable and gets to know you. During my last pregnancy I had complications during which I was hospitalized and had to have an MD take over but she still visited me everyday to see how I was doing. Luckily I was released and she was there to deliver my baby. In the moment I kind of didn't care anymore what my plans were but she was so supportive and stayed with me and reminded me of things that would help. I ended up with a wonderful experience and a happy, healthy baby :-) I almost wish we were having more kids so I could do it all over with her again. I still plan to see her yearly and I'd definitely reccomend her to anyone who asked. "
5096,41383,0.0,"Dr. Webb was wonderful! I felt comfortable the moment I met her. She is friendly and knowledgeable. She listens and gets to know you as a person, not a patient. She tailors care to your needs and expectations. I would highly recommend her to anyone.  "
5097,41384,1.0, 
5098,41384,1.0,"Dr. Weinshel was a Very caring man. He was straight forward, and explained everything. He wasn't judgemental, and he did a Great job taking care of me. He told me the risks of the surgery, and he was willing to see me if I ever needed further attention. He talked to my family when they had questions. I would recommend him to everyone!! I have to thank this man for helping me when I have been turned down from so many doctors thinking that it was all in my head and that I needed pain meds for no reason!!!He found the problem and took care of it, and now I don't even walk with a cane or even limp...THANK YOU DOCTOR..AND GOD BLESS YOU...  "
5099,41384,1.0,Dr Weinshel is very rude..Poor bedside manor. recommend this doctor!!! 
5100,41384,1.0,"I had Dr Weinshel in 1997 due to no insurance I had to see him, he repaired my herniated disk. 2006 sneezed and blew total (same as above) disk out, needed disk fussion couldn't remember him so I went back to him. Horrible...1st app. he was late and complained about his bad day. Looked at my films and told me I had to have the fussion surg. So durring my surg. he mistakenly cut my nerve..oops! I was sopose to be inpatient 2 days that turned into 5 my husband wanted to nock his head off, very rude thought he was God and took his time fixing the nerve that was leeking spinal fluid into my body and I was very ill, another Dr. had to do a blood patch. Didn't order PT for recovery now 1 year later I still have bad back and now curved lumbar spine so I need to see a different Dr.  NOT HIM!!! "
5101,41384,1.0,Excellent skills and a very caring personality.  
5102,41385,2.0,Didn't even personally discuss my diagnosis with me.  Discovered it on discharge paperwork!  Staff is VERY unreliable.  Gets messages wrong/doesn't deliver messages/delivers messages late.  Made to feel like an inconvenience by the entire staff there.  No one returns my calls.  
5103,41386,2.0,explains things thoroughly 
5104,41387,1.0,"WOULD NOT RECOMMEND TO ANYONE, WAS NOT HELPFUL, BARELY DID THE EXAM AND DID NOT EXAMINE THE AREA OF CONCERNAT ALL!!! "
5105,41387,1.0,Did not order the right test and never said what was wrong. very bad doctor 
5106,41387,1.0,"This ER doctor took extraordinary measures to keep us up to date on my wife's condition.  He did not hesitate to discuss the condition with a neurologist when he felt the specialized treatment was out of his area of expertise.   Ordinarily, ER visits are painful--but Dr Westfall gave us the best treatment and informative care we have received in quite some time! "
5107,41387,1.0,"I took my son to the E.R. for treatment. Dr. Westfall came in after quite some time, asked a few questions and was very rude. He made us feel like we were in his way. Since the rooms are quite close together I could hear him talking down to the woman next to us exactly the same way. Nobody wakes up and says &quot;hey, I'd like to go sit in the E.R. today, &quot; and nobody deserves to be treated like dirt either.  "
5108,41388,0.0,My previous doctor retired and recommended Dr. Webster to me as a replacement. I am extrememly pleased with her. She is very knowlegable in all fields which is great eliminating the need for me to see more than one doctor for my health care.  
5109,41389,0.0, 
5110,41389,0.0,"Love, love, love Dr Julie.  She is very knowledgeable &amp; lets you know what to expect in the coming months/year between checkups.  Makes you feel very comfortable asking questions; doesn't rush you; and very good with my daughter who had a phobia of drs before Julie.  "
5111,41390,2.0,this guy rocks 
5112,41391,0.0,She was great! Adjusted me and I instantly felt better. She made me feel comfortable and would go back to her all the time! 
5113,41391,0.0,". She is Awesome, She adjusted me and I had instant relief from my headache! She does a great job! would strongly recommend her to anyone with headaches or back pain!! "
5114,41392,1.0,"unless you have a serious problem, doctor wagner does not care. I stopped in with a minor problem that were giving me uncomfortable symptoms because my normal doctor did not have any openings for weeks just to see what was going on. He treated me like a complete idiot and sent me on my way. Left the office crying. "
5115,41393,0.0,"He refused to treat me for my migraine with narcodics which is the only thing that helps. (I have a 25 year history) Wanted to give me benydril and compazine, then some other meds that I know wouldnt work cause I've tried them. And if those didnt work he wanted to send me to another hospital as inpatient! He asked me what other ER's Ive gone to in the past 3 months implying I was an addict and drug seeking. I go to the ER maybe 4 times a year, hardly a frequent flyer!!! I left without treatment. My mother also had him for a different reason and he was rude and disrespectful to her also.  He needs to find a new career, one that doesnt involve compasion or socialization! "
5116,41394,2.0,Dr. White seems very knowledgable and experienced.  Felt very comfortable and would feel safe undergoing surgery by this doctor. I felt like my questions were answered and I didn't feel rushed. 
5117,41395,0.0,"I am an RN for over 30years and found Dr.Wendricks very knowledgable and a skillful surgeon. I would not hesitate to recommend her to family or friends.  I again am a surgical nurse for over 30 years, I know bad doctors, Dr. Wendricks is a fine doctor. "
5118,41395,0.0,Does not acknowledge when patients are in pain.  Very forgetful!  Nursing staff is very rude.  Appointments are constantly cancelled.  Would not refer this doctor to anyone! 
5119,41395,0.0,"Although I was unhappy with the amount of time I spent in her waiting room throughout my pregnancy, I eventually learned to not schedule appointments late in the morning or late in the afternoon, by which time she was often running behind schedule. As for the care she gave, Dr. Wendricks was pivotal in helping me get medical diagnoses/treatment that resulted in a polypectomy and, in turn, resulted in a successful pregnancy after 12+ months of trying to conceive. She was very responsive to my requests, very informative and balanced in her advice, maybe a little quick to prescribe drugs, but ultimately a thoughtful doctor that I trusted. I would use her again and have recommended her to others. She also has an exceptional nursing staff that replied to phone inquiries quickly and with great care. "
5120,41395,0.0,a great doctor and has the ability reassure the patient by providing the information in a positive tone. Great disposition -- love her 
5121,41395,0.0,"I love this doctor, she always answers my questions fully, takes the time with me that i need, and even has hugged me while i cried! She has always given me the information i need to make fully informed decisions medically, and has an extremely friendly staff supporting her. I feel like she truly care about me and my health and the health of my unborn child. I completely trust her and her judgement. "
5122,41395,0.0,Very disappointed in the care I recieved.  Did not listen to me or acknowledge my pain.  
5123,41395,0.0,"I only saw Dr. Wendricks a few times before realizing I was not important enough for her time. She did a procedure that was more painful after than the sypmtoms before procedure. My PCP had to put me on antibotics for infection because Dr. Wendricks didn't believe something she did would cause an infection. Not her fault, people do get infection, but she still could have acknowledge it and treated. Also does not believe you are in pain when you are. Guess she was one of those women who have no pain or complicatiions when she had children. Best of luck to her. But she won't be getting anymore of my business. "
5124,41395,0.0,"She let me beg for help for 6 months while Stage IV endometriosis inside me was agonzing & I could not care for my children.  She ignored pictures I drew, pain maps I wrote, & family history of disease.  She mislead State Medical Board & Dept. re: the care she gave me.  She claimed I cancelled apointments that her office cancelled.  She would not help me get referred to appropriate care after I asked in writing for help.  She lied about op-notes she had not yet typed.  She offered hysterectomy for a treatable disease.  She could not tell me what doctor would assist her, since she said she was not experienced enough to treat my endometriosis.  She made notes about my husband's job in my record, but failed to document my bowel problems/symptom: my bowel was adhered to about 1/2-3/4 cup of endometrial tissue, adhered to the posterior vaginal wall, my ovaries were adhered to each other and my uterus & the endometrial mass.  She ignored all of my symptoms & did nothing to give me care. "
5125,41395,0.0,"I had to wait in the office for 20 minutes, but Dr. Wendricks made me feel at ease. She has a wonderful manner, and was very knowledgable about my condition. she gave me options and helped me decide what would work for me. Highly recommend. "
5126,41396,0.0,Dr Webb has always beeen very helpful and very professional. she has always explained everything to me. I have a lot of faith in her. I would recommend her to anyone looking for a optometrist. I have been very satisified and comfortable with her.  
5127,41396,0.0,"Dr. Webb gave me a diagnosis and a few years later changed his mind even though he claimed to be an expert regarding this condition.  He was very rude and condescending.  He is a very mean and nasty person and I would highly recommend choosing a different foot dr.  The fact that he gave me a diagnosis in a field that he had no expertise but claimed to, and later stated that I didn't have, makes me question his stability.  "
5128,41396,0.0,"Dr. Webb is very thoughtful, patient and caring.  She takes the time to listen and suggests helpful practices.  Her staff is very helpful and polite and return your phone calls almost immediately. "
5129,41397,1.0,"Dr Wendorf has a way to make you feel like you matter.  He was very helpful, friendly, and professional "
5130,41398,1.0,"Very poor! Talks too much and listens too little!. Is really into himself and not into his patients. In a recent article sent out in a magazine by ThedaCare it quotes Wasco as saying they differ as &quot;they are here for the long haul&quot;. Let me assure you that is as long as you don't have any questions; as long as you don't have any after hour emergencies or as long as you don't inconvenience him in any way. He will be no where to be found if you have questions/concerns or are truly experencing a medical emergency. He is all &quot;lip service&quot; and nothing else. Move on, and look for a real professional.  You owe it to yourself, don't you&#63; "
5131,41398,1.0,"This physician needs to have his license revoked or suspended.  He could not even diagnose or recognize a problem that he alleges through advertising that he is a &quot;specialist&quot; in.  I disagree with the last poster - all people make mistakes, BUT IT TAKES A REAL PERSON TO OWN UP TO THEIR MISTAKES AND TRY TO RECTIFY THEM IN SOME WAY!!!  Walking away from your &quot;mistake&quot; when you are a physician makes you a very poor physician.  There is no need in society for physicians of his caliber!  Think twice before you even have this physician put a bandaid on your finger.  "
5132,41398,1.0,"Dr. Wasco performed 2 colonascapies on me and I found him to be extremeely kind, knowledgeble, caring and took the time out for my needs and concerns! If he does this, yes! I think he would be abit behind schule, maybe he just needs to make his times with his patients abit longer, depending on the situations.  "
5133,41398,1.0,"You know, Dr. Wasco is a very kind and great doctor!  There isnt a perfect person nor doctor in this world!  Everyone makes mistakes!  I have had the privilege and honor to work with this doctor for more than 4 years!  He is very good at what he does!  I just think that this website is bogis and I think its pretty bad for people to come to this site and talk bad about there doctor.  Dr. Wasco has saved and helped and cured many patients! "
5134,41398,1.0,"Dr Wasco was prompt, courteous and very considerate of my concerns and questions.  I would not hesitate to use him again in the future.  "
5135,41398,1.0,"Our family doctor referred my wife to this physician last year for a colonoscopy.  After a great length of time, Dr Wasco came out and spoke to me.  He said he almost perforated the wall of my wife's colon and she would have to stay in recovery and that he was going to do another procedure in the afternoon.  He was very short with me and took no time to answer questions.  He said he has done this a thousand times and nothing like this ever happened.   She made it through that procedure.  Now our family Dr wants my wife to go back for another colocscopy.  I told him we do not want Dr Wasco.  He said there are other surgeons in the same practice that can do the procedure.  He said we should request someone other than Dr Wasco, but said he can't guarantee that we won't get Dr Wasco.  I told him I would throw myself over my wife's body if I thought Wasco was ever going to touch her again.   Since when doesn't a patient have a right to refuse to be treated by a Dr they have no confidence in "
5136,41398,1.0,"This is the poorest physician I have ever been referred to.  I hope others never have to experience the terrible care I received from him.  Primary Care Physicians should use some kind of discretion when referring patients.  He was rude and took no time to answer our questions.  The few seconds he did take to speak to us, he spoke &quot;down&quot; to us.  Theda Clark would do well to send him packing. "
5137,41398,1.0,"This physician is by far, the poorest physician I have ever seen.  He is rude, extremely immature and failed to diagnose, treat and intervene surgically relative to a serious medical condition.  His bedside manner is poor.  He is NOT a good listener.  He talks constantly, but never says a thing! "
5138,41398,1.0,Dr Wasco performed a Thyroidectomy on me 5/8/2000 he did an excellant job. He was very professional and actually caught a mistake from the lab of St. Elizabeths Hospital and saved me from getting the wrong side of my thyroid out because of suspicious cells. I cant even see my scar anymore.  
5139,41398,1.0,"This physician has failed, beyond all comprehension, to diagnose and intervene surgically in a serious medical condition that is well within his alleged area of &quot;expertise&quot;.  He knew what had to be done to correct my condition; he explained it in great detail in January of 2007, but kept putting it off.  In August and September of 2007 when my family really began to pressure him to take care of this problem (he had the most knowledge as to what to do, as I had previously had an unsuccessful bariatric surgery performed by him, so my places to go for treatment were quite limited) he referred me to a facility 96 miles away from my home and actually medically abondonned me.  I have since found that he damaged my vagus nerve in previous surgeries, which he was well aware of, he has falsified my medical records and when my husband told him that I was seriousle considering filing a complaint against him, he replied &quot;if she ever does that I''ll fix it so that no other physician "
5140,41398,1.0,"There is no excuse for a physician in Dr. Wasco's field to have poor bedside manner, considering the fact that he chose this profession and he was aware of the interaction he would have to have with patients in order to be successful in this profession. If he cannot do that, or finds this position too stressful, perhaps he should see if McDonald's is hiring. "
5141,41398,1.0,Dr Wasco really listened and was readily available and offered options that fit my situation. 
5142,41399,1.0,"During the WDA's Mission of Mercy I was fortunate enough to get Dr. Wagner to extract 2 teeth.  The second was problematic as it had 3 roots.  He worked patiently through it and got the job done.  Thank you very much for your time, knowledge, compassion and professionalism.  It was greatly appreciated. "
5143,41399,1.0,"I had the BEST experience at Dr. Wagner's office today. They offered IV Sedation while I had a tooth extracted. They made me feel at ease, explain everything in detail, had the cost estimate before starting and the sedation was &quot;priceless&quot;! If I ever need work done in the future, I will definetley be returning to Dr. Wagner. I would recommend him to everyone! "
5144,41399,1.0,"The Doctor and his Staff were all Top Notch . My surgery was at 8:00 AM , a time when most people you meet barely speak , much less smile . Not the case here . The entire staff , including the receptionist were Cheerful , Friendly , and Extremely outgoing to make sure I was comfortable . I felt a  sincere Family feeling from the time I arrived to the time I left . The Doctor was Thorough , and very proffesional . The Surgery itself was completely painless , and completed before I had a chance to even think about it . I would Highly recommend Doctor Wagner and His Staff to Everyone that may need Oral Surgery .  "
5145,41399,1.0,I've paid the 20% down and am waiting to hear how much of the procedure my ins. co. will cover.  
5146,41399,1.0,"I wanted to have an implant and grafting needed to be done first. The initial consultation was free where others charge $125 or more. I decided to have it done. Dr. Wagner had developed 3 plans and we chose one. The grafting I was asleep for. There was never any pain whatsoever from that other than when a stitch started to tug. I had the implant which I was awake for; again no pain at all. I felt like I was there with my sisters and a very talented brother. They really treat you like family, including giving you a hard time in fun. It was almost an enjoyable experience. He charges much less than others and from my experience, is much more talented. I'd trust him with anything. They will all become your friends. "
5147,41399,1.0,"I needed work done quickly and shopped around. I'm glad Dr. Wagner got me in the quickest because the experience was so much better than expected--I'm not the best patient when it comes to work in my mouth. The surgery was done extremely well but, more importantly (to me), I was put at ease by the friendliness and understanding of my fears by both the doctor and his assistant. I would recommend Dr. Wagner to everyone. As a bonus, the building the office is in is a gorgeous old home.  "
5148,41399,1.0,"I needed to have a molar extracted, that had a vertical fracture.  There wasn't much left to grab on to, so needless to say I was very nervous.  I had decided no matter what the insurance didn't cover, I wanted to be sedated.  Dr. Wagner and his staff were so kind and courteous, I knew that I was in good hands.  This is the first extraction that I have had, that I am not sore at all, even though it required a couple of stitches.  I was able to carry on my normal business without any pain at all.  I would recommend Dr. Wagner and his staff to any one.  Thanks to all that helped my experience a calm, good one.  I would have never believed that the day of an extraction that I would be going to a party that same evening.  Dr.  Wagner and his staff are AWESOME!!!!! "
5149,41399,1.0,The staff was friendly and caring and made my son's visit (wisdom teeth removal) as stress free and comfortable as possible. on a scale of 1-10 they are a 10.  
5150,41399,1.0,"I was a bit apprehensive about having all four wisdsom teeth removed and wasn't looking forward to possible post surgery pain. However, Dr. Wagner and his staff took excellent care of me- both at my consultation as well as before, during, and after my surgery! All of the staff at Dr. Wager's office are utstandingly kind and friendly and they make surgery a breeze! I left the office after surgery with no swelling and very minimal pain. I attribute it to Dr. Wagner's expertise and excellent technique. I would definitely reccomend Dr.  Wagner and his staff 100%! "
5151,41399,1.0,"I have worked in the dental field years ago, so I know a good dental office when I see one and they are far and few between. Dr. Wagner and his his staff are truly exceptional. Dr. Wagner is confident, yet down-to-earth and compassionate (a rare find!). He is very knowledgeable and without a doubt technically skilled. I had four wisdom teeth taken out at 41, and look better than most people I saw who had them taken out much younger. My pain and swelling were minimal--much less than I expected. His office is *exceptionally clean*, and he and his staff are superb about hiding anything that might give someone fear (tools prior to surgery, blood after a procedure, etc). Anna, the LPN who assisted during my surgery, was also very compassionate and understanding when I expressed my fears. Dr. Wagner followed up on me to see how I was doing. My experience couldn't be any better, if I wanted it to be. Of all the dentists I have seen, he ranks #1. Hands down and so does his staff! "
5152,41399,1.0,"Very professional, knowledgeable and will spend the time needed to explain surgery information.  "
5153,41400,1.0,"He is the most caring pediatrician.  I work with many doctors and a daily basis and no one compares to his level of care.  He called me when my son wouldn't hurse, because of a gi bug, three times to check on him.  He offered to come into the clinic on his day off to see my son.  I went to urgent care and he called to see how it went.  He is wonderful!!!! I just wish I didn't have to drive a hour to see him since he left Eau Claire. "
5154,41401,1.0,awesome. did a great job. he is a very smart and dedicated doctor. he was able to figure out my problems when 2 other doctors in the area could not 
5155,41402,2.0,yelled at my husband for not returning to previous dentist to have work done. 
5156,41404,1.0," BEWARE! This man should be embarrassed to call himself a doctor. I have had numerous back surgeries, and deal with chronic pain daily. I was referred to Yeatman by a well respected doctor, thinking that he would be able to offer me treatment different than what I've been receiving.  I was offended Immediately by an off-color **** political cartoon caricature of our President of the United States, hanging in one of his treatment rooms. I tried to look past that and give him the benefit of the doubt. His ignorance was only magnified when I asked for help getting off addictive medication.  The judgments, accusations, and threats that I received from this man regarding my medication use was unbelievable!  He not only verbally attacked me, but he attacked my lifestyle and my profession as well. I got off the meds without his help.  I have never met anyone as unprofessional and unethical as Doug Yeatman. I would rather live in pain, than be seen by this man.  Run away, and Run away FAST! "
5157,41404,1.0, I wouldn't send my dog to this Dr. He is trying to get rid of his competition by running out other Drs and then refusing to take the cases of the Dr he has driven out. Because of this man I now have to go to MAYO CLINIC in order to get proper treatment. He is arrogant and one day he is going to stand before God when the books are opened and I'd like to watch and see what happens.  Doctors are supposed to care about people NOT HURT THEM!! He's an arrogant jerk!!!! 
5158,41404,1.0," WORST DOCTOR I HAVE EVER SEEN, DOESN'T LIKE OVERWEIGHT PATIENTS AND DOESN'T HAVE A CLUE ABOUT CHRONIC PAIN. "
5159,41404,1.0,".  The WORST DOCTOR I have ever seen, has NO CLUE ABOUT CHRONIC PAIN OR HOW TO DIAGNOSE IT!!! "
5160,41404,1.0," IN MY OPINION:   Dr. Yeatman Is an arrogant, uncaring Doctor with delusions of grandeur. His God complex and his condescension should be broadcast from the rooftop. I was his patient by default, when he took over for the previous head of the pain clinic in Green Bay. I was being managed for pain resulting from 5 failed surgeries to repair my back from atrophy of disks and failed back syndrome. My disability claim was in process at a critical stage after 4  years of denials and appeals... and his response to my request for help to complete the previous doctor's recom-mendations was met with his telling me that I was a malingerer!!!! He had not even read my medical history! This guy is a moron...STAY CLEAR.... BEWARE!!!!! "
5161,41404,1.0," If you want a Dr who is excellent and CARES!!- you need to see Dr Yeatman!  He is excellent and I can not say enough good things about him!  Avoid the pain Dr at AMC, he will tortue you and just want to do surgery on you to put in some device that is expensive.  Go get a good Dr and see Dr Yeatman! "
5162,41404,1.0," After being cast aside by some of the local neuro surgeons, with a herniated disk, a friend's recommendation to see Dr Yeatman was a Godsend. Dr Yeatman has kept me walking for the last year. He has ALWAYS been there when I needed help controlling my pain even if it was a holiday weekend! I FULLY recommend Dr Yeatman for anyone who is suffering from any type of pain. "
5163,41404,1.0,.   
5164,41405,0.0," Dr Yorke is a fantastic doctor. I have suffered with multiple health problems for 20 years. I switched to Dr Yorke and she resolved each and every one of my problems. She is very caring, thorough and in tune with her patients. She treats the body and the soul.  "
5165,41405,0.0, Dr. Yorke is the most helpful and knowledgeable physician I have ever seen. She makes me like to see my Dr.  
5166,41422,1.0," I went with my husband to hear the results of 2 CT scans.  Dr. Yacoub explained the situation very well, was very patient in answering all questions and has a very polite yet friendly manner.  He is a very competent dr. who we have great faith and trust in.  I as a woman have gone to dr. Yacoub for several years and always found him to be a very good dr. who treated me with respect. "
5167,41422,1.0, Great Doctor. He spent his time answering questions. I felt like he really explained things well &amp; helped my dad. 
5168,41422,1.0," He treats women as if they are hysterical. He ignored my complaints about back issues and said it was all in my head. I went to the walk-in clinic after 18mos of being told it was nothing and begged for an MRI (it had gotten so bad I could barely walk). The MRI showed I had 3 ruptured discs and one was crushing a nerve. This man should not be a doctor. I've heard other accounts of him treating women as if they are hysterical nutjobs (even after car accidents), including a nurse who worked for him that said he tends to treat women as sub-humans. "
5169,41423,1.0," I had to wait one hour+ with my elderly mother to see Dr. Yaish. Other patients came in after us and were seen first. His nurse was also very rude after my mother complained about waiting so long. I think he is knowledgeable as a doctor, but he needs to stop overbooking appointments. It seems like he is just trying to make as much money as possible. Sad case it is. My advice, drive to Madison and see someone that does not try to see as many patients as possible in one day.  "
5170,41423,1.0," I am not happy with Dr. Yaish's care. Dr. Yaish is always 45 to 60 minutes late from the scheduled appointment. He bed side manner is very cold. When asked questions about my procedure and care, his responses are always short and rude. I have asked others in the waiting room if they have experienced the same and was told they also saw that side from him. I will take my medical care to another professional medical doctor.  "
5171,41423,1.0," My experience with Dr. Yaish was so &quot;sterile&quot;-cold, scary and uncomfortable. The staff was friendly but very slow and forgot to take my vitals. Also, there was a lack of communication between the doctor and the office staff on the followup procedures. I will seek my medical needs elsewhere in the future.    "
5172,41423,1.0, My experience at Dr. Yaish's Office was so warm and comforting. Usually when you go to a doctors office its &quot;sterile&quot;-cold and scary. I was so happy upon arrival. The staff was so freindly and the Dr. himself was so pleasant and down to earth.  Loved my visit! 
5173,41423,1.0," Dr. Yaish is a wonderful doctor.  He takes the time to listen.  But be prepared to wait forever.  We have young children that see him and try to schedule the early appointments.  When we arrive there are at least 10-15 other patients in his waiting area.  If our appointment is at 9:00 we sometimes don't get in until 10:30 or later.  It seems they schedule appointments on top of each other.  It's frustrating.  We don't mind waiting up to a half an hour, but when you have children, try to entertain them for the longer periods of time.  We do understand how he may need to take longer with some of his patients, but don't schedule so many at the same time. Paid/Co-pay:$1100"
5174,41423,1.0,".  He is very knowledgeable, has found my problems within minutes, of simple tests, knows what hes talking about "
5175,41423,1.0," excellent doctor.  Very knowledgeable, and explained everything very clearly.  I would highly recommend this doctor.  "
5176,41423,1.0, Very knowledgeable and thoroughly explained everything.  Highly recommend! 
5177,41423,1.0," clearly explains everything, in terminology you can understand. does not rush through the exam and onto the next patient.  I have seen many children coming in and out with my multiple appts and they almost all leave with smiles. "
5178,41423,1.0, He was EXTREMELY helpful after I had issues after i had my tonsils removed I would recommend this dr to anyone 
5179,41423,1.0," Very nice, knowledgable.  Explained everything well.  Did not assume anything was self explainatory. "
5180,41436,1.0," Gloria and the office staff are great, but I have lost my trust and faith in Dr. Yaish and his nurse. I had a mole removed and had to come back twice because he did not do the job correctly in the first visit. These unnecessary extra visits cost me a $160.00 each visit. I think someone is lining their pockets. They do forget to take vitals unless you remind them to do so and they are always in a hurry to push you out the door before taking time to answer medical questions concerning your visit. I do not feel comfortable any more visiting Dr. Yaish. But be prepared to wait forever. We schedule early appointments. When we arrive there are at least 8-10 other patients waiting to see the doctor. If our appointment is at 9:00 we sometimes don't get in until 10:15 or later. It seems they schedule appointments on top of each other. It's frustrating.  "
5181,41437,1.0, My son had chronic bowel problems. He has very foul smelling loose stool.  We saw Dr. Yaffee.  The doctor did not even examine my son.  he looked at the food chart I had made and told me &quot;he drinks too much juice.  cut back on the juice&quot;.  Not at all helpful in my case.  We have Dean insurance.  He is the only provider we can see.... 
5182,41437,1.0," If I'm being honest, I couldn't stand Dr. Yaffe. I had to wait about an hr every time I had to take my son to him. He pretty much told me that everything was in my head and that nothing was wrong with my son, when we finally found out he could not tolerate milk or soy. Once we made the switch my son was a whole different child, rarely cried, compared to crying all day every day. Dr. Yaffe was not only unhelpful, but was very rude and made me out to be a horrible mother even though I was doing everything I could and doing the best I could. I would never recommend him to anyone. I was fortunated enough to find Dr. Trias and am sad we must switch insurance and leave. He was the complete opposite of Dr. Yaffe, who I found to be uncaring and not friendly at all. "
5183,41437,1.0," We feel so fortunate to have Dr. Yaffe as our children's pediatrician. He is thoughtful, caring, and thorough. He never rushes through an appointment, but takes the time to communicate with us. When your child is with Dr. Yaffe, you feel as if she or he is his only patient. "
5184,41437,1.0, he is incredible! My son has a feeding tube and this man is by far one of the most caring and professional doctors I have ever seen. 
5185,41437,1.0," I disagree with the other opinion. Dr. Yaffe talked to my son respectfully. Most importantly, he was able to diagnose the GI problem my son had- which two other doctors were unable to do.  "
5186,41438,1.0, Great doctor! Performed great GI procedures for me.  I would highly recommend him. His staff was wonderful too. Thank you. KK 
5187,41438,1.0," 45 minute wait minimum, 10 minute visit maximum.  More interested in my profession than my health.  "
5188,41438,1.0," I have been seeing this Doc for 18 Years, he seams to be a good fellow, takes his time when he is with me and always gave useful information. Did a perfect colonoscopy Always has showed genuine concern for my well being so far. Never pushy. All the staff is very very nice especially De&#63; Thanks to all for taking care of me.  K "
5189,41438,1.0, Never explained intructions about a test then cancelled because I took my heart medicine and he said I shouldn't have taken it.  I wont see him again 
5190,41438,1.0," Very unhelpful.  Does not make the well-being of his patient's a priority.  Does not take into account patient's concerns appropriately.  Does not tell patient's the results of tests in a timely matter if at all.  Staff, particularly the receptionist, are very rude.  "
5191,41445,1.0, I have been going to Dr. Yiannas for 5 years and think he is a great doctor who really cares about his patients.  
5192,41445,1.0," Dr. Yiannas really cares about his patients, you are not just another person to him. He really listens to you when you explain what is wrong with your health, he asks a lot of clarifying questions and comes up with several plans of action. I have seen Dr. Yiannas for a variety of different problems and always found the problem solved within several days. Dr. Yiannas always takes the time to answer your questions and explain things in a way that is easy to understand. I highly reccomend him.  "
5193,41445,1.0," Dr Yiannas was very nice the first time I met with him. That is where his kindness ended. The next time I saw him he was very rude to me. He made very inappropiate comments about my weight (I had just given birth 6 weeks prior to this meeting) He also asked me how I expected to be a good mother if I was &quot;too large&quot; to take care of my daughter. I weighed 150 lbs at the time. I left his office in tears and was upset for days. He made me feel subhuman. I decided to make a complaint with Medical Associates, the medical center he works for. Once he was spoken to about my complain, he began stalking me.  He would call me several times a day from blocked numbers!! What a psycho! "
5194,41450,0.0, Highly recommended! I went to see Dr Yang twice for two different issues and in both cases the prescribed treatments solved my problems.  
5195,41450,0.0," I was very pleased with Dr. Yang. She was very knowledgeable, overall had a good experience, would definitely recommend my family and friends to see her.  "
5196,41450,0.0, Doctor told me that my allergies to antibiotics &quot;wasn't making anything any easier&quot; and then proceeded to prescribe antibiotics and a medicine I had previously tried with little success.  She was very behind schedule and didn't care about what I had already tried for my skin.  She also seemed to push expensive treatments like Fraxel instead of less invasive treatments. 
5197,41450,0.0,  
5198,41453,1.0," Exceptional! Dr. Yazbak was thorough in examination, provided an understanding of the diagnosis and surgical plan, as well as follow-up care. Dr. Yazbak gave special attention to individual needs. Dr. Yazbak made our family feel quite comfortable; he was personable in conversation. Dr Yazbak also provided his home phone should we have any questions or emergency needs.  "
5199,41453,1.0, This doctor sucks. If you have a work injury he won`t even treat you or tell you what is wrong and leave you suffer this is no joke. 
5200,41453,1.0, Excellent physician - would not trust my neuro care to another.  
5201,41453,1.0, Knowledgeable neurosurgeon for back problems. NOT anxious to operate to gain financially. Will test and advise of negative possibilities. Kind.  
5202,41458,0.0, pack a lunch you will be there a minimum of 2 hours.  Then they will take you med info and not give you back info for your records 
5203,41458,0.0, same as everyone else that complained she never sees u take two weeks to get appointment 
5204,41458,0.0," STAY AWAY - SHE IS A PIRANHA!  Have someone else filling your meds before you go there. She has me searching 13 years back into my medical records and is plagiarizing other doctors notes.  After our first meeting she added so many negative notes it sounded as if my internal medicine doctor had doubts about me.  She has given me a rash for the last three months.  She also talks text book down at patients... &quot;I respect you&quot; bat eyes &quot;I feel your pain&quot; bat eyes.  She was more concerned about her makeup dripping and her outfit than obtaining a new MRI for me.  I had to use my OB/GYN to get one.  And unlike her &quot;suspicion&quot;, things have gotten worse.   Rather than finally consult me as a physician - she wants to set up a 3rd appointment to discuss missing records from a decade ago!  And after all she has messed up, no way do I want her hands on my therapy records! "
5205,41458,0.0," I spent over 18 months and tens of thousands of dollars for absolutely nothing! Ms. Yeatman (I can not refer to her as a Doctor) is rude, and can't be trusted. Countless times I was slated to see her. After the &quot;dog and pony show&quot; with her and some of her staff, I never saw her again! I scheduled appointments with her time after time...always got the same &quot;treatment&quot;. Another staff member always accompanied by a &quot;witness&quot; indicating that Ms. Yeatman was busy or not available/out...when she wasn't. I saw her! The other staff members never read my file...and talk about not listening or caring and ignoring my medical records. Never have I seen anything like this! Stay away from her and the clinic as a whole. Anyone who has had good results from Ms. Yeatman is just plain lucky.The whole operation is just a money making joke. Yes, take away all of those terrible painkillers and then just SUFFER.  Why do you think they were prescribed in the first place! "
5206,41458,0.0," I had been complaining about back pain for the last several years, but no one would listen or do anything.  I saw Dr Yeatman for the first time and she immediately ordered and MRI.  The MRI showed that I have cancer.  Dr Yeatman sat with me and explained everyting with compassion.  Her office staff was supportive and caring.  Dr Yeatman immediately refered me to a cancer doctor and I am now getting treatment. Dr Yeatman believed me when I said I had pain, figured out why I was having pain and got me treatment.  Without her I would still be dying and not even know it.  If she runs late for your appointment, it could be because she is taking the time she needs to figure out what is wrong or even giving someone bad news.  Be patient as she will give you the same attention, its worth the wait! "
5207,41458,0.0, 1st appt to see dr yeatman to schedule a cortizone injection. first you see a nurse and then a nurse practitioner (to help pad billings) and then finally dr amy yeatman.  she did little at this appt except to let us know she could perform the injection and try and refer us to some other doctors in her clinic for pain mgmt and fibro (one of the doctors flat out asked why we were traveling so far to see him).  She performed the injection.  then at follow-up meeting (supposedly with dr yeatman) i never get to see her.  she does not talk to her patients after an injection.  instead you talk to a nurse and her idiot nurse pracitioner (my personal opinion).  what kind of greedy unethical idiot (again my opinion) would not meet her patient to talk about the 1st trtmnt and further options.  she now refuses to phone us for over 3 weeks and we must schedule an appt to see her.  she is in it just for the money.  we are fighting all charges out of principle.   this is a boilerroom operation 
5208,41458,0.0," My father suffered from extreme pain due to cancer that had spread to the bones.  We felt helpless to help him when the regular pain meds weren't working.  Dr. Amy Yeatman managed his pain effectively, and helped us take care of him and keep him comfortable through the last year of his life.  When he became uncomfortable at the very end and could no longer travel to her office, we called on her for help and within hours she visited our home (after hours).  She is extremely knowledgeable, sympathetic and truly cares about her patients.  She made a HUGE difference in my father's quality of life and helped him to the very end.  My only complaint is that her office staff (in 2006) tended to aggressively blockade communication - we had to be &quot;pushy&quot; to get through to Dr. Yeatman until she provided her private number to help us get around the front desk problems.  We are extremely grateful to Dr. Yeatman for not being afraid to CARE about her patients and get to know them.  "
5209,41458,0.0,.  I am very unhappy with her You can never talk to her you go in see the nurse she comes in a few minutes and leaves Does not listen to anything you tell her I told her I needed something because my current meds were not enough anymore my body is getting immune to them Put me on meds that were less then effective called Thurs because my pain was worse blood pressure shot way up felt awful on edge all the time Talked to machine in morning staff called late afternoon said she was done for week had to wait till mon nothing they can do What the heck can't they call her or another dr to cover for her Her and husband pushed the ANS I told them before that it made me feel worse told me the one they would put in me would do more programs and definately would help not so My meds are suppose to be faxed to my drugstore most of the time it is not done they make you call in advance and they can't do their job I am paying out a lot of money and then I have to take off work to pick up rx and lose more 
5210,41458,0.0," I had been going to see another doc at the pain clinic for a year before he left due to the other docs crap he did not want to deal with anymore. Amy was my new doc. First time I saw her she could not remember my name even though I reminded her for the whole 15 min. she saw me. Took all forms of treatment, not just medication, away and told me it was not helping me so I didn't need treatment. She left while I was asking her questions and never returned. I would never send even someone I don't like to see her. Little did she know that I have a very serious condition and need treatment. Guess that would have been helpfull knowing along with my name when she desided to stop all treatment. I have now found my old doc and am so very happy to see him again. Good luck to all who brave seeing this doc. Hope it don't backfire on your health. "
5211,41458,0.0, I cannot consider this woman a Dr I found her extremly rude could not get her act together kept leaving the room did not read reports correctly even said I did not even had mris done. Her exam was a tap on the inside of each ankle. She was unbelievable the way she talked to me. My primary when recieving her aknowledging letter was just laughing at what she wrote. I would caution anyone using her as I feel she could cause someone problems with other treatments that are needed if their dr believed everything she reports. 
5212,41458,0.0, Extremely knowledgable Pain Physician. I have been push from Doc to Doc without ever being told in plane English what I have. She explained it clearly and outlined a plan for my treatment.So far my pain has decreased 10 times what the others have done. She has decraesed my narcotics and I am able to play with my kids and actually work. I read the previous rating and can guess that they wanted more drugs or did not like her recommendations and did not follow them. I have heard from other pain patients that her clinic is not a drug pushing clinic and the I needed to go to another for lots of drugs. I thought that was informative since I wanted off of my drugs. Thank you Dr. Amy Yeatman for giviing me a better life.  
5213,41460,1.0," Dr. Young is a really friendly doctor. I saw him because I was having problems with my stomach and was pleasantly surprised when he knew basically everything about my previous stomach problems (the first time I met him!).  He took the time to research my medical history before hand and hit the ground running putting the pieces of the puzzle together concerning my stomach problems.  He asked many questions, listened to my concerns and took time to explain things other doctors never even told me before.  He is a very nice man and seems to be very knowledgeable.   I recommend him to anyone! "
5214,41461,2.0," Very helpful, knowledgeable and friendly. "
5215,41467,1.0, Extremely good experience.  Doctor is friendly and seemed genuinely concerned about my discomfort.  My first visit was on a Saturday morning with a very sore lower back.  Initial exam was thorough but I did not have X-rays taken and they were not pushed.  I had scheduled an appointment with the first available doctor but he made it very clear that after the first appointment I was welcome to see any of his colleagues if I preferred and he would not be offended.  I really appreciate that offer from any professional in a larger practice.  Subsequent appointments (I had 5) were brief but the adjustments were effective. While other services were offered and suggested he was never pushy or insistent; he was very polite when I indicated that I would probably be ending the treatment until I could figure out my insurance situation.  Staff in the office is pleasant and appointment times are convenient and usually easily gotten.  Longest wait was approx 5 min. after scheduled start time.

5217,41469,2.0, Had a great experience with Dr Yadava at New Berlin office.

5219,41484,1.0," worst doc ever STAY AWAY did a lot of damage he lied on all his reports covered his mistakes so he thought he put a stim in me never worked so he tells me lets take out that one which was only 3 months old and try a new one for another 60.000,and if that dont work we will put in a pain pump during one of my revisions which he told me he never has i woke up in the middle with the needle stuck into my spinal cord SCREAMING he said it never happened and never documented it but after i was put on heavy nerve damage meds.please stay away i was afraid for my life this is TRUE.....  "
5220,41484,1.0," ended up getting 2 nerve stimulator surgeries under his care after the second one failed to, I did some second opinions and found out he dosent know what he is doing and had to get the whole thing redone again from a Dr. in Madison. Yak is in appleton, stay away if you can. he has put me and my family through hell. this was all in a 5 month period.  "
5221,41484,1.0, Dr. Yakovlev was not at the Marshfield Clinic when the last people posted their messages. Nice try. 
5222,41484,1.0," Very difficult to understand.  I was rushed through appointment.  Within minutes of reviewing my chart and speaking to me, he had written two prescriptions.  He did not take adequate time to discuss my problem, how he was going to help me.  I was very, very disappointed and never went back to his office. "
5223,41488,1.0, Dr Yagoda has been wonderful with both of our children.  He takes the time the time to understand and never appears to rush through any situation.  
5224,41492,1.0," Thorough and interested in all aspects of the patient's life.  Willing to go the extra mile whether it be researching unfamiliar illnesses with the patient or contacting you via cell phone or e-mail if it is easier for you.  Very hurried due to a busy schedule, but always on top of everything and doesn't cut corners.  "
5225,41492,1.0," Shows great interest in finding the underlying issue. Punctuality usually ok. Excellent knowledge base, I have been very pleased with care.  "
5226,41492,1.0," Dr. Yiannias has been my family doctor for several years. I have some very difficult to treat disorders, and he has been compassionate and thorough. I feel confident that he always gives 100% to his patients. I would recommend him to anyone. I genuinely trust him when I don't feel well.  "
5227,41492,1.0, Dr. Yiannias is one of the most observant and helpful doctors I have ever encountered.  
5228,41493,0.0," THE BEST! She is absolutely wonderful, highly recommended! "
5229,41501,1.0," Worst doctor I ever dealt with.  Was in a hurry, walked into the room and asked me what my story was and then proceeded to treat me as if he didn't hear a word I said and I could tell he was in a rush to get me out of the office.  I was in pain for three days after this man was done with me.  Was very rough and almost to the point of nasty when working on my ears.  When I cried out he acted like it was no big deal.  After I left his office my ear was bleeding and the blood was running down my neck.  I continue to bleed for a week and a half.  It took three weeks of treatment by another doctor to finally heal all the damage that was caused by Yale.  "
5230,41501,1.0, Absolutely awful. This is the worst doctor I have ever come in contact with. He does not listen and seems to be in a perpetual rush. I had to drive 40 miles for an appointment that he saw me for 37 seconds. Amazing. Terrible. 
5231,41501,1.0,.  WOnderful!!! after years of suffering he finally gave me some relief!! such a personable guy and really listens to whatyour concerns are!! 
5232,41501,1.0, He misdiagnosed me and I suffered for months before he would do any sort of testing.  Once the actual problem was figured out he didn't follow up.  I would not recommend him as he doesn't hear what the patient is telling him and he makes up his own mind to what your diagnosis is; instead of getting the facts first. Paid/Co-pay:$130
5233,41502,2.0, Very attentive and very helpful. Really seems to care. 
5234,41502,2.0,.  dr yang is very well informed and thurough 
5235,41504,2.0,very personable and easy to talk to.  Was very thorough and knowledgable.  
5236,41505,0.0,She has an attitude. She makes you feel stupid. She repeats herself over and over. She asks the same questions over and over. She was too rough with my baby. She acts all know it all. I felt very uncomfortable. 
5237,41505,0.0,"This doctor does not lisiten to parents concerns. She tells you something along the lines, of &quot;Oh, your child has autistic tendacies.&quot; after panicking and seeking specialists to take care of my child. Which all came back negative (Thank goodness). That is not the issue, the issue I had was when I requested a copy of my childs files in order to take to a psychologist to determine why my child had these behavorial issues (because she wouldn't address those), I recieved my childs file and the majority of the file had derrogetory remarks about Me. &quot;Mom suspects her child is autistic.&quot; Mom gave up on child being autistic&quot;. Umm, I would not have even considered autism if she did not tell me that she thought he was autistic. I will not return to her. "
5238,41506,1.0,Dr. Zeeb is one of the best health care professionals I have ever encountered.  He recommended procedures which resulted in a great improvement in my overall health.  His cosmetic ability is impressive and is only surpassed by his honest and warm personality.  I trust him completely with my family's health.  Thank you Dr. Zeeb! 
5239,41506,1.0,"Dr. Zeeb is very gentle and caring. He explained in detail what work I needed to have and the crown looks very natural. I highly recommend him, "
5240,41507,0.0,"DR Z., is a wonderful Dr. She played a key/significant role in helping me during a terrible time. She looks at &quot;you&quot; the person and not just the clinical data to determine what's going on... She's not a clock watcher -- she gives all her patients the time they need to figure out how to address their health issues best! Thank's Dr. Z., for taking care of me. "
5241,41507,0.0,"Dr. Zaremba is the most caring, helpful and doctor I have ever encountered.  She truly cares about her patients, she is usually late thats because she doesn't rush you out and you never feel hurried, when she is with you she is &quot;with you 100%&quot;. I She knows her drugs and does not push them on you but explains what they do.  "
5242,41507,0.0,This is the first doctor I've had in 62 years of my life that actually cares about her patients.  She will talk to you in language you can understand.  She will ask questions and I believe she will always do what is in the best interest of her patients.  Her staff is very professional and courteous.  All are willing to help when needed no matter what.  
5243,41507,0.0,"She is the best Dr in the world! She has been my Dr for many years, ever since she came to the Burlington clinic. Yes it's true the wait to see her IS LONG, it also is WELL WORTH YOUR WAIT as she is OVERLY KIND AND ABOVE AND BEYOND A CARING DR/PERSON! Her knowledge is unbelievable and she will work hard to help you with all concerns you have. I can talk to her openly and she REALLY CARES about not only medical needs, she also cares 100% about you as a person. Although not medically related I think her accent is awesome. She is just beautiful both on the inside as well as on the outside. I hope I can keep  her as my Dr for as long as I can, she has become an extremely important person within my life.  "
5244,41507,0.0,She is the best Dr. ever. I travel 35 miles to see her and I have no plans on ever changing Doctors as long as she exsepts my inserence.  
5245,41507,0.0,"Very very slow office. Nice doctor, but a very long wait. "
5246,41508,1.0,"Was referred to him from another doctor who couldn't diagnose my problem.  He knew just by looking at my arm that I had multiple problems (tenisinivitis, epocondolitis,etc.)  If it wasn't for him, I'd still be in alot of pain in my arm.  What a God send!! "
5247,41509,1.0,"Dr. Zaide is knowledgeable and friendly.  He took me as a new patient same day as I called.  He knows his stuff, has a sense of humor, and is someone I can feel comfortable with.  His staff were also all friendly and compassionate.  "
5248,41509,1.0,Dr. Zaide helped me through a very difficult time in my life. He is one of the most compassionate and down to earth doctors I've met. Unfortunately he has now moved to Wisconsin and will no longer be my physician. I was lucky to have him as my physician when he was here.  
5249,41510,0.0,"While everyone's experience is different,find the negative one hard to believe. Dr. Z was very thorough with me, answered questions, even called back on her non-clinic day. She respected my preference for &quot;low tech&quot; solutions and the overall impact of skin and wound problems.  Definitely recommend.  PS got refered to her by a friend whose malignant melanoma Dr. Z.diagnosed early.  "
5250,41510,0.0,I have been a patient of Dr. Zirbel for the past 10 years.  She always addresses my concerns and is very detailed when examining for skin cancers. I never feel rushed and she is a very calm and polite.  
5251,41510,0.0,"I almost feel like the other rating listed here is a complete lie. Dr. Zirbel was extremely helpful and compassionate, and was extremely good at comforting me pre/during/post the countless procedures I've had with her. She has always made it a point to have me call if I have any concerns and she was able to get me in very quickly (1-2 days) after I had a cyst appear on my face. I think she understands a lot of the things she treats also have a huge self-esteem impact on patients and therefore does her best to fix any ailments.  I would easily recommend her to anyone! "
5252,41510,0.0,"Dr Zirbel has no bedside manner. She did not address my concerns and did not perform the services I request. When I asked her some questions about one of my health issues, she brushed me off to another doctor. It was a complete waste of money and time.  I should have known better- I had the same experience the first time I went to her! Don't make the same mistake- twice- as I did!!! "
5253,41511,1.0,Knows medicine and keeps the patient informed and entertained. 
5254,41511,1.0,"Dr. Zeihen is professional, thorough, thoughtful and willing to listen to me.  I have been his patient for at least 25 years, and I wouldn't trade him for any other.  If I question a treatment, he doesn't get arrogant; he just explains why he has prescribed that treatment.  And I appreciate it. "
5255,41512,1.0,"Very nice receptionists and nurse. Dr Z is very nice and has an unusually good 'bedside manner'. He is very informative and spent a lot of time with me. He gave me a prescription, but not until after full exam and deliberation. Only one visit, but highly recommended.  There are doctors who are both good and nice! "
5256,41513,2.0,Really likes the idea of patients giving input on their treatment. 
5257,41514,0.0,Dr. Zhu did a total knee replacement on my mother and was exceptional in his bedside manner and extremely helpful with her care before and after surgery.  
5258,41514,0.0,"He wouldn't see me because I was ten minutes late and he doesn't like it when you come late, so I don't know what his knowledge level is.  It was my first visit to him, so I didn't even get in.  He makes you feel like he believes his time is more important than yours and won't see you if you don't get there right on time regardless of the reason.  As I was reschuduling for a different doctor in the office one of his patients walked out, so he wouldn't have even been in my room to see me until after the scheduled time.  "
5259,41515,1.0,He made my hand whole again! Best hand doc in Madison! 
5260,41516,2.0,. worst dentist ever!!! totally rude and uncaring&gt; would never go back 
5261,41517,2.0,"Kind, caring, compassionate, and an outstanding surgeon. "
5262,41517,2.0,Excellent doctor. 
5263,41518,2.0,"Amazing professionalism, very kind, sincere and understanding. Just a wonderful doctor! "
5264,41519,0.0,He was very kind and listened without interupting.  Quite respectful of my mothers shyness when performing the physical examination.  His explaination was easy to understand.  He went out of his way to make us comfortable and to make sure we fully comprehended the instructions for my mothers care and of her medications.  I myself am switching to him along with the rest of my family. 
5265,41519,0.0,"Helped my mother get GAMP and into nursing home so she could recover after surgery. Very good bedside manner, really listen and cares about his patients. Actually sits and asks questions and pays attention to the answers. We can call him any time of the day or night when there is a problem. "
5266,41520,1.0,I was told there was &quot;nothing more they could do for me&quot; following my TIA. Waited around hours to get sent home.  
5267,41520,1.0,"His diagnosis was possible Malingering and anxiety and depression. When my true diagnosis should have been bone spurs, hearnation, lessions, degenerate disk diease and spinal stenosis, fibromyalia. Which his failure to took into caused me perment nerve danage.  "
5268,41521,1.0,"Great doctor.  Really cares about his patients, has great knowledge and gives advice that takes all the right things into account.  "
5269,41521,1.0,I trust  Dr. Zukowski with my family 100%. He is so caring and gentle. Patient and ready to answer any questions you may have.  
5270,41521,1.0,"Although his office staff isn't very personable, Dr. Zukowski and his nurses are a rare find! EXCELLENT doctor for both of my children! Unfortunately, our insurance changed and the drive is a bit too far.  I would recommend him to anyone in the area! "
5271,41521,1.0, 
5272,41522,1.0,Great Doctor! Trust him with everything. 
5273,41523,2.0,Great Doctor. Spent a lot of time with our family. 
5274,41524,1.0,"Dr Zambrano went totally out of his way to take very good care of my husband!  He had both knees replaced and the rotar cuff had extensive surgery.  We are so very pleased with the Doc, he is an exception in surgeons.  He laughs and he is &quot;REAL&quot;...Doc even lets me get pictures taken with him, he is an EXCEPTION... We brag about him to all our friends! "
5275,41524,1.0,"Dr. Zabrano is very talented when it comes to surgery. He was compassionate and caring. After care, however, when there still problems he indicated it was all psychosomatic. He had his mind made up before entering the exam room and didn't even examine me. Upon telling this to my general physican, she sent me to a pain management doctor. At that time it was confirmed the same diagnosis that was given to me by my general md. I have gone through spinal injections, and a very expensive brace. "
5276,41525,1.0,"Dr. Zernzach is very patient, listening, helpful. I never feel hurried; office visits are always very satifying.  Staff fits me in on same day when there is an emergency.  Dr. Z quickly responds to a letter requesting further information, clarification, or help for a new condition.  He has a quiet, almost hidden, sense of humor and seems to appreciate knowledge evidenced by the patient regarding the condition under discussion.  My immediate and extended family have been patients of his for well over twenty years.  There are many doctors and health facilities in our area and we would not have stayed with Dr. Z. this long if we did not feel that he is an excellent diagnostician who knows the proper treatment to be followed.  He is conservative in prescribing drugs, does not easily recommend surgery, and orders only necessary tests.  He makes phone calls in person, initiating action on the part of the patient.  He is always patient with patients.  Best description:  a good doctor.  "
5277,41526,1.0,"first of all, this doc showed up 45 minutes late to the appointment!!! Then, he did not even let me explain my symptoms and history in detail. He just jumped to a conclusion real quick and stood up and decided to walk away. I was not even done with my questions and doubts. He literally walked away. He was in the room with me for only 10-12 minutes. I was really angry but ofcourse couldnt do anything about it !! These docs need to stop thinking themselves as gods. I have seen similiar behaviour from other UW health docs too.  "
5278,41526,1.0,". repaired 4 disc, Complete recovery,full range of motion, if someone is going to opereate on my back it is going to be DrZ "
5279,41526,1.0,"He is an rude, arrogant and dismissive. After years of spine pain, degenerative discs and osteo arthriti, he laughed and told me to get some hobbies. He is more into making money than being helpful. "
5280,41526,1.0,did not explain in detail how much pain you may be in for many weeks after surgery.bed side manner poor. 
5281,41526,1.0,"Not a very compassionate person. He's supposed to be a great surgeon, but he couldn't fix me. I don't blame him for that. But he is responsible for his behavior. He has no bedside manner. I have spoken with so many of his other patients who have had the same terrible experience. He doesn't believe in pain. He accuses you of fabricating it all and suggests that you take an aspirin. Its a shame that the university chooses to side with the money he brings in rather than the high number of patients he hurts with his words. Eventually, someone is going to snap and hurt themselves and maybe then the U will take notice. "
5282,41526,1.0,"My local Orthopedist has the same condition I had, but half as bad. I asked him what he was going to do and he said have surgery. I asked him what surgeon and Dr. Z was it, so that's who I wanted. I got in for a consultation in three weeks, surgery two weeks after that. I has fusion of S1 to L5 which was fractured and 1/3 moved out of place, and no disc between. He used the new LT cage and synthetic bone protein. After 10 weeks I biked 36 miles, after a yr. I was healing wonderfully. I have advanced degenerative disc disease and am only 47 yrs. old. My neck hurts more than the low back did. I asked him about that, he ordered xrays, and wanted no more to do with me. My local doc ordered MRI and found two bulging discs. I did forward the results to Dr. Z for future reference. I am going to PT and pain mgt. Maybe Dr. Z will help me with my neck later. As for my fusion, it was the best thing I ever did. I'm better than new. Yes, his people skills are lacking, but he's a great surgeon. "
5283,41526,1.0,"I went to Zdeblik looking for solutions to neck problems associated with a connective tissue disorder.  I know I was asking him to think outside his normal thought process, but he didn't even try.  He had clearly made his mind up before entering the exam room that I was wasting his time, grilling me on how I was able to get an appointment.  The condition (Ehlers-Danlos) is real as are the symptoms, and it may be that there was nothing he could do to help. But I left the meeting certain that my concerns weren't even considered.  Interestingly, as I was leaving he made an effort to spare my feelings.  I would much rather have left with hurt feelings AND some answers.   I don't know if he's a good surgeon, but he's a very poor diagnostician.  Steer clear from this one if you can. "
5284,41526,1.0,"I would have liked for Dr Z to have done my surgery, but because of a lack of communication between UW and my insurance it looks like I will have to find someone else to do my surgery. Perhaps it's an issue with his staff, but I could not get the forms I needed filled out, I had my MRI's sent three times before they recieved them, overall lack of willingness to get things done for the patient. "
5285,41526,1.0,"Dr. Zdeblick is THE BEST spine surgeon in the U.S. He is thorough, knowledgable, easy to talk to and an expert in the correction of any spine problem. If you want it done right, this dr. is the man to see. "
5286,41527,2.0,Great doctor. 
5287,41528,0.0,"Dr. Cheryl Ziegler has my respect because of her knowledge and the time she takes to care for my eyes. I see her to have my retinas examined and for glaucoma. She is conscientious, explains treatment options thoroughly, and works to ensure satisfaction. Her staff is also friendly and helpful. She also saw my infant daughter as part of Wisconsin's program for free checks for infant's vision.http://www.woa-eyes.org/infantsee-public. Dr. Ziegler was able to give me feedback about my daughter's developing vision.  Just love this doc.   Glad to have found her! "

5289,41530,1.0,"Knows his medicine well, tells you all the in's out's of what he is doing, does not use scare tactics but best of all he listens and explains in lay mans terms. "

5291,41531,2.0, 
5292,41532,2.0,Very friendly. Takes time to get to know you.

5295,41535,1.0,My wife and I both have been very comfortable with Dr. Zuzick. avery kind and knowledgeable doctor. 
5296,41535,1.0,"This Doctor is very good, even my husband likes going to him. Very nice and makes you feel comfortable. "
5297,41535,1.0, 
5298,41536,1.0,"Very good at bedside manner.  Not punctual, but it is because he actually sits and talks to you.  "
5299,41537,1.0,"Terrible Dr...wouldn't even send my dog there.  He &amp; PA Sara can be friendly &amp; appear helpful, but when I ran into probs they were unavail and rude saying I &quot;could tough it out&quot;.  When I ran into problems there was no way to page Dr.  Leaving urgent message in their voicemail on a weekday during business hrs, I didn't get a call back until 5 hrs later.  When I expressed my concerns to Dr. after these issues, there was no apology and even NO acknowledgement that there were any problems that he was going to fix...my 10 minutes of appointment was up.  Who works with people on strong narcotics &amp; gives them no way to get urgent help&#63;!!  They knew when at ER they wld not give any treatment seeing my narcotic profile &amp; yet I was forced to go there after waiting 5 hrs for their callback.  Really made me question his &quot;20+&quot; yrs of expertise and his even caring about the physical hell I ended up in.  Don't go there if you areooking for quality care...won't find it there in Dr Z, PA Sara or staff.  "
5300,41537,1.0,"Dr.Zoeller was very nice, and I would say he spent an average amount of time with me. I think he could have explained his thoughts on my complicated problems more to me.  However, when coming back for follow up, I saw his PA (which I didn't know I was seeing) and it turned out very well. Sara Stoddard is excellent, and very caring.  I will continue to seek care there.  "
5301,41537,1.0,I found Dr Zoeller to be friendly & knowledgeable. I would recommend him to others.  
5302,41537,1.0,He spent less than 2 minutes with me and was very rude and not helpful in answering questions.  
5303,41537,1.0,"Very nice, knowledgable, but hard to get in and always on a tight schedule.  "
5304,41538,0.0,. very thorough; is very calming and listens to what you have to say 
5305,41538,0.0,. she is very concientious about her patients 
5306,41539,1.0,This doctor was very helpful.  He explains everything in detail in a way that you can understand what is wrong with your body as well as the treatment he will be peforming 
5307,41540,1.0,Always listens to his patients.  Shows compassion and concern .  Wants patients to take a role in their healthcare. 
5308,41540,1.0,"Rude, borderline abusive.  Every time I went to him, follow-up care at different doctors contradicted his diagnosis and treatment course.  Reception staff is always unfriendly, at times markedly nasty.  "
5309,41540,1.0,He trusts his patients to know when something is wrong with them or their children.  
5310,41541,2.0,This clinic certainly is a little treasure in Wauwatosa.  I've been adjusted by both Dr. Sara Zach and Dr. Rich Protasiewicz and both doctors are exceptionally skilled practitioners.  I would recommend them to anyone looking for quality care and friendly personable doctors. 
5311,41541,2.0,A very professional chiropractor with great adjusting skills and knowledge of the body.  Highly recommended for people who have never been to a chiropractor. 
5312,41542,1.0,He does a very good job and seems to care for his patients.  
5313,41542,1.0,I love this man! My husband is afraid of dentist due to childhood and early adult experiences... this Doc made him feel good about the visit and he let him work on him to take care of his issues... he offers the more expensive options as well as alternatives... he gives you all the information regarding cost and procedures and lets you decide what you would like to have/pay for.  He is awesome! 
5314,41544,1.0,"Dr Zent is the nicest, most helpful Dr I have ever come across and I am 56 years old. He explains everything, answers questions and is careful. I trust him completely. He ran into problems with one of my oral surgeries but didn't rush because he had patients waiting. Lots of follow up and even called me at home himself to see how I was doing. You don't see doctors like him much. I would highly recommend him to anyone.  "
5315,41549,1.0," On numerous visits this physician has misdiagnosed my child and given ill guided information, at one visit when my child was very ill I was told his oxygen saturation being 82% was fine for a 3 year old.  I am a registered nurse and know this is not within normal limits.  "
5316,41560,0.0," Dr. D. is an exceptional doctor that treats patients with respect, candor, and appropriate time/interest/knowledge. She refers as needed to excellent specialists.  I recommend her whole-heartedly.  I respect her ability and have always benefited from her care.  She is my top rated doctor and I have seen plenty in my 63 years and moving around the world with my Army husband.  Do not hesitate to see her if you are looking for an internist.  "
5317,41562,1.0, awesome Dr. and staff were very helpful and courteous. latest technology.  
5318,41562,1.0," I grind my teeth at night and wear a mouth guard to prevent damage to my teeth. I have had to wear one for 15 years, and never has any insurance company covered this piece. I went to see this dentist, and he &quot;guaranteed&quot; me that my insurance would cover the mouth guard, and made impressions for one. I asked if they didn't cover it, how much it would cost, and he told me not to worry, it was covered. I received the guard and a $660 bill. When I said I didn't want it, he said the service was rendered and that I had to pay. I would never take my family back to this dentist, he is way over priced, and lies to get business. Previous mouth guards cost around $150 from other dentist.  I take my family to another local dentist, and their charge was $113 for the same thing!!!  Think twice before you go to Chris Davidson, they will scam you! "
5319,41566,1.0," Jiri Danczik is the worst doctor I know. He was unprofessional beyond belief. I was at my lowest point healthwise when he asked me if I ever touched myself. I think he did this because he said he knew I thought him attractive. I am a mentally ill patient and I dont understand how a doctor can decide to mess with your mind. I never reported this because I did not want to make an issue of it because it was embarrassing but now I know that I did nothing wrong, but he did. I saw his report on healthgrades.com and he is a highly rated doctor on that site. I think it is because people trust him and like him just like I did. However, I think it is the doctors responsibility to try to make you better, not worse.  "
5320,41566,1.0," Dr. Jiri Danczik was extremely unproffesional because he asked me inappropriate questions like &quot;Do I ****&#63;&quot;. He also gave me an overdose of my medications, zoloft and ambien. One time, he also he told me I was good looking. Furthermore, when I asked him about his background he angrily gave a vague and complicated answer. I really trusted him at first. He was very friendly at first and seemed to have good character. These incidences occured about one and a half years after I began the therapy, so that is why I trusted him. His behavior caused me to become very depressed. -Ruth Roybal "

5325,41578,1.0," I made an appointment with Dr. Donaldson after getting out of the hospital for a right arm dvt.  My GP was doing a great job with my INR checks, but I needed to have someone with a little more knowledge of dvts so my mind could be at ease.  He answered my page of questions.  He went above and beyond by calling a vascular surgeon in Salt Lake City to make sure his approach was right and if the pain I was feeling was normal.  Since I had the last appointment of the day the office shut down after I left.  He called back and left his cell number on my voice mail so I could call him back after hours to explain what the surgeon said. "

5331,41592,1.0, While it is our medical clinics policy not Dr. Demetrious. I am of the understanding that preffered providers are supposed to write off what money my insurance doesnt pay. I may hate our local medical clinic but I adore Dr. Demetriou and can not recommend him enough.  
5332,41596,2.0," Perhaps the other reviewer has not frequented this man in the last 12 to 18 months or longer.  They and everyone need to check outhttps://glsuite.ncmedboard.org/DataTier/Documents/Re...and it would not be surprising to see more such orders before much more time elapses.  Advice is to go somewhere else and stay far, far away from Day.  "

5335,41626,0.0," Dr. Eskam delivered my second child and was the worst Dr. I have ever had. Even 20 years after the fact and many other Doctors visits, she is by far the worst I ever experienced. She actually showed up to deliver my baby in black leather pants! Unprofessional, terrible bedside manner! Don't risk it people...go to someone who cares and knows what they are doing! "
5336,41626,0.0, I wasted valuable time seeing this doctor who did not recognize and did not even check for cancer because cysts are usually benign. I am so thankful for my new doctor who would never be so careless.

5338,41626,0.0," Dr. Eskam is not a life saver and only treats you for whatever is popular at the time.  She is worthless and I would have died had I not left Cheyenne and sought other avenues!!  I'm alive today, only thanks to the wonderful doctor I currently have!! "

Amazing doctor and such a wonderful woman. She is truly missed by my family but we will always be blessed to have known her.  
5342,41633,0.0," I take my son to Ehler because she is very helpful and has 20+ years of experience in PIUC in the USA, as well as other countries. She doesn't downplay symptoms, rather she starts from the most serious and works down to the least serious. She gives each patient her cell phone number so that if you have a weekend emergency, you can contact her at home. She will answer her cell phone for that reason during your appointment, but I feel good that she cares that much about her patients, and is on call 24/7. She is very honest and has a lot of patience for kids. The wait time can be a little long, but it is well worth it, I would never take my son anywhere else. There is a lab there, so there isn't any waiting for results, it is done right there.  "

5347,41665,1.0, Dr. Emory refused to treat a condition that I have been battling for over 5 years because he thought treatment would have been premature. Maybe he wasn't educated enough to treat me and maybe he was too proud to admit it.  Dr. Emory also said that i would never find another Doctor to treat my condition.  As of right now I am recovering from surgery and i have 100% of the feeling back in both of my legs.  I regret wasting all of the time and money spent trying to receive treatment from Dr. Emory. 
5348,41667,1.0,"I was severely injured in an accident and he was the surgeon on call. He was wonderful about dealing with my severe injuries and explaining things to my famil and to me.

He has delivered my only child and performed surgery on me. I have had 2 of the same surgeries prior to seeing Hansen, and the recovery time and scars were not near as great as Hansen did. I will continue to see this doctor for his entire career, even if I move to NY and have to fly back to see him.  Him and his staff deserve 100 stars, they are the best of the best... and I am not easily pleased. My husband has 2 other kids, and he said our sons birth was such a better experience than the other doctor and hospital that his kids were born in.

5355,41670,1.0,"I really like this doctor.  He has been very thorough and knowledgeable.  I have a history of uterine fibroids for which I had to have a major surgery several years ago.  He has made sure I keep up on my appointments, ultrasounds, etc.  He asks how I feel about specific symptoms, treatments, etc., rather than just dictating.  He never treats me like I'm asking dumb questions, etc.  "
5356,41670,1.0,"He didnt even examine me when I came in for a second opinion. Just gave me pamphlets and sent me on my way, to come back and visit him a month later ...uh I am sick .. I need answers ..... oh yeah I was charged a co-pay for that too "

5364,41673,1.0,"Wonderful caring, knowledgeable doctor. He always gets to know us as humans and how our lives affect our treatments and yes, he puts in long hours and always calls to go over lab results after the office closes. Because he is so popular, bring a good book and expect to wait in a crowded but comfortable waiting (living) room...often as much as two hours. Ask receptionist how far behind he is running and you can get your errands run and return. "

I would not recommend this dentist to anyone ever!!!!! Thought the rest of the staff are very nice and caring...  
5375,41680,2.0,Very unprofessional. It took 3 weeks for results on a simple procedure.   Extremely poor service! 
5376,41681,1.0,"Depending on the day I was seeing Dr. Haden, i received good or bad service.  Sometimes he seemed like he understood and other days like I was just a pain for him to see.

5383,41684,0.0,A 1 Dr Hedgecock listens while you explain the symptoms and is honest enough to send you to another doctor if she is unsure of the cause.

5388,41685,0.0,She performed 2 c-sections on me in 1996 &amp; 2001 when I lived in Southern California and I loved her work.  Very skilled surgeon as far as baby deliveries. I was very pleased with her and her staff.

5390,41685,0.0,"This dr performed a scope to find the problem.  Found the problem with the uterus as well as an ulcerated ovary, but did not go ahead and put a call into the insurance for permission to remove then.  When I woke up she informed me that I needed a hysterectomy.  I was just dumb enough to go back to her for it.  On the morning of my surgery, after we had already discussed that everything including BOTH ovaries were coming out, literally as they are wheeling me into the surgical area she starts saying how with my age one ovary should be left in...messing with your mind I like to call it.  Anyway, less than 3 years later...more female issues and almost suspect that all of the the fallopian tube wasn't removed causing a cyst to grow into a mass that spread into my vital organs.  I would not recommend her for surgery.  Get a second opinion. "
5391,41685,0.0,"she is always wanting to run new tests and do new surgeries. I saw her in 2004 in Riverton, wyoming ended up with a hysterectomy. When I was having issues afterwards she told me I needed a pschyatrist..........not impressed.. did several unessacery surgeries on me!! "
5392,41685,0.0,"Do not go to her.  She mis-diagnosed me over a period of a year when she was practicing in Newport Beach, CA.  She also continually treated me for a yeast infection i did not have and even subjected me to a cervical biopsy for no reason! When I finally switched doctors, they couldn't believe my experience with doctor Hannaney.  I thought about suing her, or at least formally complaining somehow, but I just wanted to put the whole experience behind me.   She seemed like an okay person but not knowledgable and didnt want to take the time to find out what was really going on.  Steer clear.  Wish this website had been around then (this was like 6 years ago).  "
5393,41686,1.0,Very good chiropractor. Also does accupuncture and homeopathy.  He got me off of prescription allergy meds and helped my migraines.

5395,41687,1.0,"Dr. Haack was amazing.  He is very caring toward our daughter and he and his staff were very courteous.  The only time he was late was the morning of the surgery but it wasn't an issue overall.  The excessive amount we paid is due to a monopoly of the hospital on our town, not him.  "

5400,41690,1.0,"I have chronic and longstanding health issues necessitating multiple surgeries and numerous medications.  In addition to attentive, responsive & prompt care, Dr Hagemeyer is the first among more than a dozen doctors that have treated me on an ongoing basis, who supports my wish to take as few medications as possible.  His care & concern are evident the moment you meet him.  I recommend Dr Hagemeyer without reservation.  "
5401,41691,0.0,"Dr. Hardy has done surgery on myself and my 9 year old daughter and we both had great experiences.  She would like for him to be her regular dentist.  The staff out front is somewhat lacking, especially the bookkeeper but the surgical staff almost makes up for it.  "
5402,41691,0.0,"Very good at simple tooth extractions but does not listen to patient complaints at all and does not seem to care about patient complaints.  &quot;Conversations&quot; are a monologue from the oral surgeon.  He keeps giving handouts and telling you you are fine.  If no problems arise, he's good.  Otherwise, you're left in pain and no where to go.  I will not go back to this person. (Especially for upper tooth extractions where holes in the sinus can be a problem.) "
5403,41693,1.0, TELLS HOSPITAL TO PUT ON LIST THAT HE'S TAKING NEW PATIENTS.  I CALLED AND GOT VOICEMAIL AND THEY CALLED BACK NEXT MORNING TO SET APPOINTMENT FOR THAT AFTERNOON. THEN THEY CALLED BACK 1/2 HOUR LATER TO CANCEL AND SAY I HAVE TO FILL OUT APPLICATION FIRST.  THEN THEY SCREEN APP TO SEE IF PATIENT HAS INSURANCE OR NOT.  EVIDENTLY IF YOU WANT TO PAY CASH HE WILL DENY YOU AS A PATIENT.  STAFF VERY INEFFICIENT AND DOES NOT RETURN CALLS TO UPDATE PROGRESS AS PROMISED. I HAD TO KEEP CALLING BACK.  WASTED A WHOLE DAY TRYING TO GET A APPOINTMENT.  IDEEN HIMSELF IS VERY RUDE AND HAS NO CONSIDERATION FOR SOMEONE IN NEED OF CARE.  WOULD NOT RECOMMEND TO TREAT MY PETS. 
5404,41693,1.0," I enjoyed Dr Ideen he was very helpful, in figuring out what was going on with me.  He also has helped tremendously with my daughters heart and lung problems.  "
5405,41693,1.0, Dr Ideen takes the time to explain conditions to his patients so they can understand them. HE IS VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE!!! He is the ONLY doctor in Casper that continues to care for his patients while in the hospital. He is very personable and shows true compassion for his patients. His staff is very friendly. You can call almost anytime and get SAME DAY APPOINTMENTS if needed. I would strongly recommend him to everyone! Thank you Dr. Ideen for caring for my family. 
5406,41693,1.0," A year ago I went to Ideen and Mcguire. They did not help me at all. I now have an excellent Dr. and have had to have a gall bladder operation, a hernia operation, and a double bowel blockage fixed. These are not pro's. All they could talk about was my wine and to quit drinking it! What a diagnosis..now I am on my way to a normal life.Thanks for nothing. "
5407,41693,1.0, This is a wonderful doctor to go to. He really cares and takes the time to talk with you and find out what your major complaint is. Your not just a number. 
5408,41693,1.0," I hate going to any medical facility, but going to Doctor Ideen's friendly clinic was an absolutely Fantastic visit. I almost can't wait to get sick again so I can go back. Oh, and thanks Doc for the fishing tip! "
5409,41693,1.0, Misdiagnosed our father and kept him on the wrong medication for 6 years. Our father is suffering terribly due to his incorrect diagnosis. We feel Dr. Ideen was negligent in his practice.  
5410,41696,0.0," She wanted to do several unnecessary procedures, including removing a skin tag from the back of one of my molars (which had recently grown in and the tag went away on its own).  If I had done all the procedures she wanted, it would have gone through all my insurance for the year (it was only January) and cost an additional $2100 out of my pocket!  After going to a different dentist, they agreed that all I needed was the normal cleaning.  The staff was rude and actually hung up on me when I called to request a copy of my records! "
5411,41701,1.0," Dr Kleppinger has been my kids pediatrician for 4 years. He is always ready to see them, helpful in that he anwsers my questions. My children like him very much, he has a good dr patient manner. "

"
5413,41720,1.0, I had an ectopic pregnancy at 5-6 wks and Dr. Kaan performed emergency surgery.  During surgery he also found two large ovarian cysts and my ohter fallopian tube was closed so he went ahead and opened it as well.  He and his staff followed up well and I was very happy with him.  I know have switched over to him as my regular OBGYN doctor.  I would recommend him to anyone.  
5414,41722,0.0, takes time to answer questions &amp; inform. She's saving my life or at least my marriage. I wish everyone could see a doctor like her 
5415,41725,1.0," I found Dr Katz to be excellent in all areas relating to his professionalism; extending care,concern,and follow up. He fully expained the colonoscopy procedure and was &quot;down to earth&quot; in his approach. He performed the procedure at Sheridan Surgical Center where the staff were exceptional. This was a 5 star experience coming from someone who stays as far away from Doctors and hospitals as only possible. Wonderful Doctor and staff.  "
5416,41725,1.0," jumped to conclusions, no real tests just guess work and started stuffing me full of meds.  I don't recommend this doc to anyone.  "

5419,41727,2.0," All of them are wonderful!  I actually look forward to my cleanings - not because of the scraping, but because everyone on staff is wonderful to visit with.  The hygenists and dentists have a soft touch and even when doing fillings or pulling wisdom teeth, they take care to keep any discomfort to a minimum. "
5420,41727,2.0, they treat me very well 
5421,41728,1.0," This doctor has done three surgeries on me, TWO brain surgeries, he is the total best, I would suggest him to anyone, and the only reason I give him a 4 for Punctuality is because there are days he is just to busy and he always takes the time needed for each patient. I have been seeing him for 6-7 years and everything that I question he answers, I go in for my wrist nerves here soon and I have full confidence. I feel real bad for the person who did not do so well. I am very greatfull for Dr. K. The first brain surgery was to get a biopsy of my Cancer, he had to literally unfold my brain to get to it, the second was due to the brain swelling and fracturing my skull. Total success.  "
5422,41728,1.0," Dr. Kopitnik did a 2 level fusion on my lower back in 2009.  I am now on total disability and still looking for answers.  He said &quot;I don't know what you want me to do&quot;   WELL...I wanted you to not cut the nerve on l4,l5 when you did the fusion.  I am now looking at a lifetime of pain.  PLEASE BE CAREFUL AND GET ANOTHER OPINION IF YOU ARE GOING TO HIM.....PLEASE "
5423,41747,1.0," Overall, he helped me make improvements for a herniated disc (L5/S1).  I did find that he took little time with me and was not &quot;available&quot; to answer questions.  His staff would take messages and relay responses.  I felt like a pill of a patient when in reality, a little communication would have relieved my stress and worry.  I did like how they were able to get me in quickly.  "
5424,41773,0.0," Dr. Kearns is amazing! SO knowledgeable, and very skilled at her trade. I would definitely recommend her.  She is easily the best chiropractor I've ever seen- and believe me, I've seen a lot!! "

5427,41779,1.0,"GREAT JOB! I feel brand new. Dr. Neal is one of the nicest, and most knowledgable people I have ever met. "
5428,41779,1.0,"Dr. William Neal and Dr. Alvis Forbes performed hardware removal from a failed attempt to reattach my fibular head by Dr. Rork, and a derotational osteotomy on April 30th 2007 of a 44.1 degree femoral malrotation which was performed by Dr. Joshua Beck on my broken femur on January 11th 2007. Dr. Neal has a wonderfully simple, straight forward bedside manner backed by years of experience in the civilian world, and his financial gain seems to be at the least of his interests.  "
5429,41780,2.0,So nice and such an amazing surgeon! All around the best experience I have had with a orthopedic professional after trying several other places. 
5430,41780,2.0,I had neck surgery and had an outstanding experience. I have done well and returned to all of my sporting activities.  
5431,41781,1.0,My husband was with Dr. Niethammer for several years when he had a bad flare-up with his ulcerative colitis. Dr. Niethammer downplayed his symptoms and told us (to our faces) that &quot;sometimes these things are all in your head.&quot; My husband immediately changed doctors and ended up having his colon removed at Mayo Clinic because it was so diseased only 6 weeks after Dr. Niethammer made the above comment. We were VERY disappointed with his lack of concern for his patient. He seemed like he just wanted to get the session over with and didn't care about our questions or concerns. I would NEVER recommend him to anyone. 
5432,41782,1.0,"Dr. Nett is great! He is thorough, personable, and an all around great doctor. I trust him 100% and his staff is very nice. Highly recommended! "
5433,41783,1.0,Dr. Nowicki is top of the line.  He was very attentive to my needs.  Offered good sound advice.  Because of him I was diagnosed &amp; received treatment while in the early stages with Prostate Cancer.  Great Doctor! 
5434,41783,1.0,I was new to the area and was recommended by family. I feel that Dr. Nowicki is outstanding in his profession. I felt that he was very attentive and caring. He offers advice from the simplest/least cost to the highest and makes you feel in control of the situation. I feel he is family oriented and truly cares for his patients. 
5435,41784,0.0,"The lack of knowledge this nurse practitioner posses is scary, and to know she is working with not only children but elderly as well is even scarier! I would rather google my children's symptoms and self diagnose them before EVER taking them back to Brehan. She not only chose to give my child shots when he had a fever, but FAILED to tell me he had a fever until he ended up in the ER and I called confronting her about it. When confronted her bedside manners went out the window. She is not only unprofessional, but inexperienced and lacks knowledge in the medical field. If you care anything about your children, parents or yourself stay not only VERY FAR from Brehan but this entire practice! "
5436,41785,1.0,. He is very nice and helpful 
5437,41786,1.0,"This dentist cares about my chronic jaw pain and does his best to keep my jaw comfortable during visits.  His work is outstanding, gentle and pain free. Very nice.  Entire staff is the best.  The hygenists are all excellent and painless.  Everyone is a pleasure. "

5439,41788,1.0,Decided to try out the new dentist in tiwn after 25 years of going to the same guy. Dr nelson is the best dentist I've ever been to. He filled my cavities quickly and painlessly. I've been to him several times now and have never even felt when he gave me a shot. I haven't had any soreness or sensitivity since. He is very gentle and is all-around the best dentist I've had. I would recommend him to anyone. 
5440,41789,1.0,"Spent a lot of time with me, very thorough.  "
5441,41789,1.0,"I feel he is very knowlegable and not afraid to refer you to a specialist when needed and very caring and follows up all all patients care, A good doctor patient relationship and puts you at ease.

5454,41816,1.0,Dr Russel was very helpfull.. He is very knowlegable and has the most current tools.  A little on the spendy side but well worth it.  
5455,41817,2.0,Great surgeon. Good communication.  
5456,41818,1.0,I have been seeing Dr. Rupp as my primary care physician at the Casper VA for a couple of years. In my experience he is an outstanding physician. He is caring and shows concern for my health. He inspires trust and confidence. He is also warm and likable. Highly recommended. 
5457,41818,1.0,"Dr. Rupp is an amazing Doctor. He goes above and beyond, actually he spoils his patients with time and devotion.  "
5458,41819,0.0,"Dr Rogers was very thoughtful, and took the time to not only develop a plan of care, she reviewed my history in great detail. "
5459,41820,1.0,.  
5460,41820,1.0,Dr Reeb is very knowledgeable and answers all questions.  He takes the time needed to  be sure that you are well taken care of .  Highly recommend him.  
5461,41820,1.0,I have been a patient of Dr Reeb for almost 2 years.  I have between moderate and severe copd and am on oxygen 24/7.  He has never done a pulmonary function test or any other test having to do with my lungs other than 1 chest xray.  He comes in the exam room and studies his computer moniter and seems to be preoccupied more with losing weight than with the copd or associated problems.  
5462,41820,1.0,"I went to this Cheyenne Dr. with a &quot;9&quot; pain level in my abdomen.  He did not even do a physical exam (pressing on abdomen ). No blood work was done! The next day in the E.R. of a Pueblo hospital, my LDH was 2579, my CA at 10.4, my AST at 784, ALK PHOS was 162, ALT was 634..these levels were off the chart, and I was at a 50/50 chance of survival-- we found out in just one day after this visit with Dr. Reeb.  Dr. Reeb's treatment for me that day I saw him was to give me a sample of Nexium and sent me on my way; after which I ended up the next day in critical condition in an out of town hospital from Gall Bladder Disease.  My advice&#63;Do not trust any doctor if you come away feeling you were &quot;shorted on your care&quot; and keep your eyes, ears open, go with your gut, and if you aren't sure this doctor did the right thing by you, then see another, don't take a chance.  He is pre-occupied and not focused on you with the exception of when he is looking at his computer mon "
5463,41821,1.0,"He will charm you with his personality but please do your research and find a doctor who knows what he is doing.  He did a simple Spinal Cord Stimlator surgery on me.  When things went wrong he stopped talking to me.  I ended up in ICU the day after surgery to have emergency laminectomy to reduce the swelling from the mistakes he made.  Damaged my dura, caused nerve root damage, and now I am left with severe pain around my chest due to his grave surgical mistakes.  He refuses to talk about what mistakes he made.  Had surgery a year later to remove the stimulator and redo the laminectomy which he improperly performed.  PLEASE do not let him even get a knife close to your body as you will regret it.  When things go wrong he runs the other direction.   Do not put your life in this mans hands!!!!!!!!!!!! "
5464,41821,1.0,When I went on medicare there was a change. I had neck surgery and he or no one explain what I can't do. He did my back sugery 3 yrs ago. He no longer takes responsablty for my drop foot. Nor does he for my neck. The hospital even treated me diffent because on Medicare. Try to get pain bills from his nurses are impossible. I'm very dissappointed in him and his staff. I no longer will recomend him. I will go to Loveland know. Manly because of his  one nurse. No one called to tell me when my neck surgery was or anything. I had to do that on my own. I'm done with him and that staff of his.  
5465,41821,1.0,"Dr. Reckling did my back in 'o8' so when my neck stating up, I went to him. He did my next. When it heals I will not have any scare. I tell everyone about him. He is the best doctor I every went to.  "
5466,41821,1.0,"I was in extreme pain for years! Every doctor I went to dismissed me and told me I was too young to have these problems, and one even told me it was all in my head!  I went to Reckling after suffering for years.  We tried everything, surgery was the last resort and I am so glad I did! I feel great and its been 2 years and still feel great. Never a problem. I cant thank the man enough! "
5467,41821,1.0,"He did my second surgery on my L4, L5, and S1. I have never seen a dr. that cared so much. My first surgery was down south and it was done by a ****. I just can't say enough good things about Dr. Reckling. I'm sorry for the other people that had problems but I didn't. I'm 54 yrs old and he took such good care of me and explain everything to me and my husband. Had my back done Jan.08 and I'm going back to get my neck done. I also tell everyone I can about him.  "
5468,41821,1.0,He was very concerned about me and did not seem to be in a rush to cut on me like another surgeon.  
5469,41821,1.0,"Dr. Reckling was wonderful to me. He took a great deal of time listening to me & then an equal amount of time for the physical exam. I ended up having a 2 level cervical spine fusion.  The surgery was quick & my pain was better immediately. I see him annually & I am doing great. Dr. Reckling has been kind & concerned about my progress. I am quite young to have had a herniated disc without injury, the disc above was degenerative as well. I had been in pain for quite some time & had seen 3 other orthopedic surgeons who missed the diagnosis. My next problem was elbow pain & I went in to see Dr. Reckling, I was diagnosed & treated nonoperatively with an injection. A few years later I had severe pain in my pelvis during pregnancy, I could hardly walk. Dr. Reckling encouraged PT because he did not want to jeopardize my baby. He also did not want to give me an MRI because of my baby. I ended up fine after some PT and am eternally grateful to Dr. Reckling for such continued great care.  "
5470,41821,1.0,Great doctor. He did a fine job on my cervical fusion. I am no longer in pain.  
5471,41821,1.0,In 2000 at 31 he did a discectomy. I still was in pain 2 years later. He dismissed my pain. Luckily I moved to Washington State and went to a dr here to find out if this was normal. This Dr told me that I should consider a lawsuit. He did a proceedure on me that is not practiced in the USA anymore due to the fact it does not have high sucess rate. All Dr Reckling had to do was listen to my complaints about pain. He thought I was faking it or wanted more drugs. The Dr here was able to fix his mistakes. One of the screws Reckling had put in was just sitting there not screwed into anything. I was bone on bone. Please get a second opinion. I am not lawsuit happy. I did not sue. I am healthy now. If you are just going on personality and not skill he is a really nice man. Good luck.  
5472,41821,1.0,. you may as well get a knife and do it yourself he is nothing like his father a good docter worried about his patient not money the boy only cares about money 
5473,41821,1.0,Great doctor. helped me in making surgical decision 
5474,41821,1.0,He said if he couldn't operate on me he couldn't make enough money to keep me a patient so he refered me elsewhere after expencive xrays and office visits 
5475,41822,1.0,"The other review is completely unfair to the doctor as you have never seen him before you shouldn't have rates him so low.  As a patient of his I have had an excellent experience.  I had a breast augmentation and have amazing results and am extremely happy.  The doctor is very friendly and spent a lot of time explaining everything to me.  The office staff is very friendly and extremely helpful.  The surgery center was really really nice.  I cannot say enough about the positive experience that I had.  I was very worried going to my initial consultaion but the office eased all of my worries, and i had an excellent experience and an even better outcome. "
5476,41823,1.0,Dr Rork is a top rate doc! He has operated on me several times with success! 
5477,41823,1.0,"Dr Rok is friendly, personable and an excelent surgeon "
5478,41823,1.0,"I hired Dr. Rork to troubleshoot and repair a torn meniscus and to &quot;resurface&quot; a portion of the knee joint which had been damaged 30 years previous in the military. Dr. Rork was at all times; professional, courteous, knowledgable and occasionally humorous. Post-op was efficient and lacked drama. Staff was very supportive and knowledgable. Dr. Rork is quite possibly the best there is. "
5479,41824,1.0,wasn't able to answer questions about the treatment he was giving me. told me to look it up under webmd. I did and I didn't find anything.  
5480,41825,1.0,"Dr. Ripley and his staff were very helpful in every aspect of my dental work, I have not had any problems with the implants I go on the top, feel almost natural, look better than my orginal teeth, looking forward to getting my next set of implant on the bottom when I can afford them. Thank you Dr. Ripley you and everyone there are the best.I recommend that anyone wanting a great Dr. and knowelegable staff to see him, I had very little brusing and believe having 9 teeth the first time around taken out and 9 the last time would have brusied pretty bad but really nothing I've had darker circles under my eyes from lack of sleep your awesome. "
5481,41825,1.0,"My dentist referred me to Dr. Ripley to have my wisdom teeth out. First time I met Ripley, I was immediately at ease with him. He explained the procedure, the sedation process, EVERYTHING in details with me, and made sure I understood everything. "

5483,41827,1.0,Talented and skilled chiropractor. I had severe pain and limited use of my thumb. Dr Richardson gave me a treatment along with acupuncture. I went from zero use of my thumb to total use with little pain within a day. What a blessing! I would certainly use Dr. Richardson in the future. 
5484,41827,1.0,"Dr. Richardson could feel your back and know where it's hurting.  It's been about 6 yrs since I lived in Cody, but he was the best!  I am now in need of a good chiropractor in Casper.  I would almost drive to Cody to see Doc Richardson if I could get off of work. "

5486,41828,2.0, 
5487,41830,1.0, First visit : Doctor answered his cell phone and talked to his wife about a family issue while I was naked and he was doing my pap smear. I had some girl issues and he tried to give me Zoloft and tell me I was depressed so I again reiterated what my issue was and he said no your just depressed.  LOL The whole appointment was pretty much a waste of money and I felt violated after the cell phone call and tacky conversation : F- 
5488,41830,1.0," Dr. Scott is very patient, kind, and listens to his clients. I have had two 100% Natural child births with him and he's been wonderful with us. He is respectful of laboring mothers and also supportive of breastfeeding. He has done everything we asked and was willing to discuss our birth plan and questions we had. He is laid-back and practical. We simply love him! "

5492,41843,0.0, She is by far the best doctor I've ever been to.  She really listens and cares.  She will run any test you feel you may need just for your own peace of mind.  She doesn't have a &quot;greater than thou&quot; attitude but talks to you like a caring friend.  Unfortunately her nurse doesn't always get back the first time you call. 
5493,41843,0.0," Excellent doctor. I have numerous medical issues and she is the first doctor who has taken the time to really listen and when she can't adequately address a specific issue, she gets me to the specialists I've needed. She sometimes runs behind; however, I know that she will take all the time she needs to address all of my issues. (And I usually have quite a list!) She doesn't make you feel rushed. This makes it well worth the wait because you know you matter to her. She even stops to ask about my health when I bring my daughter to her since we are both patients, and she knows I struggle with my health. I would highly recommend this doctor to anyone looking for a new doctor.  "
5494,41843,0.0, She is the best doctor I have ever had.  She takes the time to listen to you and you know you have her full attention and it is very obvious that she cares about her patients.

5505,41883,1.0," If you're looking for an MS diagnosis, this is the place to go. He misdiagnosed me and I've talked with others that he did the same thing to. Big money in MS. His treatment caused likely permanent damage in me. I haven't had a day without pain since crossing his path. "
